data acquisition through API calls to community detection and
labelling. Several major Python libraries are discussed. There are 4
sections: data acquisition with Twisted, data formatting and network
construction with Pandas, Data compression with Numpy and Cython and
Data Enrichment with Scikit-learn.</p>
<h3>Description</h3><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Starcount has been developing automated methods to understand the
community structure of online society and the influencers within these
communities. This helps marketers go beyond individually targeted
adverts, identifying better ways for them to engage with relevant
communities and allowing them to make positive contributions and offer
services and products of real value. With billions of people using
social media across the world, pinpointing the right communities to
target is a challenging problem. We use Python to develop software that
is able to search for influencers, the communities who connect with
them, and the passions they share. Ultimately we hope to make social
media spam a thing of the past, replacing it with useful information,
and positive contributions to engaged communities.</p>
<p>In this talk we will describe an end-to-end Python stack that goes from
data acquisition through API calls to social networks all the way to
community detection and labelling and show how several major Python
libraries are meshed together to achieve these ends.</p>
<p>We break the pipeline down into 4 major components: data acquisition
with Twisted, data formatting and network construction with Pandas, Data
compression with Numpy and Cython and Data Enrichment with Scikit-learn.</p>
<p><strong>Data Extraction</strong></p>
<p>We have developed a client/server program that enables us to download
user profile, connections and user post data from various social
networks, including: Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The server is
started with a list of network IDs to perform an operation against and
access tokens to validate the operations. Once started it manages access
rate limits and the distribution of work across a network of client
applications. The clients perform the actual requests to the external
APIs using asynchronous HTTPS requests. The Twisted event-driven network
engine is used to provide features such as an event loop and
asynchronous network calls as well as a simple custom client server
capability.</p>
<p>Our core hypothesis is that social networks can be understood, at least
for commercial purposes, in terms of the interactions surrounding the
major influencers. Due to API limits, restricting the amount of data
that can be gathered, managing the size of your network is an important
consideration. The final product of our data extraction process is a
directory populated with the following file data:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Follower Metadata</li>
<li>Influencer Metadata</li>
<li>Follower-influencer Relationships</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Network Construction</strong></p>
<p>We believe that the best way to summarise the interests of social media
users is to understand what they follow and so we store links between
influencers and their followers. Our graph model differs from the
standard network graph as it has two distinct types of nodes,
influencers and followers, which are treated differently. The
relationships between followers and influencers are key to understanding
a network's user base.</p>
<p>Several of our processes require a full linear scan of the
follower-influencer connection database. This can be a time-consuming
task. We store each of the follower-influencer files in a numpy binary
format to enable very fast reads over the data. We have used Cython to
speed up this core processing significantly from our starting point of a
pure Python implementation. We store each of these files in 1% percent
samples, each of which contains roughly 7 million rows and parallelise
execution using the multiprocessing and joblib libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Compression</strong></p>
<p>We wish to detect communities of influencers and so we need a way of
determining relationship strengths between them. Our method is based on
the number of shared followers. The networks are too large and dynamic
for it to be practical to store all pairs of similarities and so instead
we compress each influencer in a form that allows similarities to be
quickly calculated when needed. This compression takes the form of
minhash signatures. While using the signatures is very quick, generating
them is an expensive operation that must iterate through billions of
follower-influencer connections, incrementally updating the signatures.
Our original implementation of this algorithm took six days to run.</p>
<p>We were able to make some improvements by profiling the code using
cProfiler and line_profiler to remove bottlenecks. Really significant
improvements were achieved by pre-processing our input data into a more
suitable format (binary numpy memmap) and using a Cython main loop. In
this specific case we managed to improve on the speed of numpy matrix
operations (with broadcasting) by writing c-code which created less
intermediate variables and hence made less calls to create new objects
on the heap. The cython annotation tool proved useful in identifying
when cPython was actually creating Python objects, especially when these
were non-obvious like views on a numpy array. In total these
optimisations reduce runtime from six days to three hours.</p>
<p><strong>Enrichment</strong></p>
<p>The final stage of our process uses machine learning algorithms to infer
user attributes. These may include demographics data such as country,
age and gender; or more advanced features such as robot detection - is
the user a person, Twitter bot or company.</p>
<p>We used the scikit-learn package which contains tools to develop machine
learning projects quickly. We typically progress by splitting the data
into different sets for cross-validation before training a
classification model such as a support vector machine or random forest.
The initial model would be tuned using scikit-learn’s grid search and
finally evaluated using validation and learning curves. Like many other
features, scikit-learn’s support vector machine is implemented using
fast and highly optimised C libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In this talk we have described how a stack compose entirely from Python
components can take raw data directly from social network APIs and
manipulate it into a form that allows brand managers to interactively
understand the communities and influencers that exist around their
products and marketplaces.</p>
