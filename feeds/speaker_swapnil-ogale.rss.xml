reviewed in a timely fashion (surprise!) and you are nicely heading
towards your release milestone. The only thing missing are some key
screenshots that you need to put in before you publish your
documentation. What you get instead are some hideous images posing as
screenshots, that were captured randomly, bears no resemblance to your
instructions and would make no sense whatsoever to the end user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We (documentarians) know how this usually pans out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about when bad screenshots happen to good writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my presentation, I will talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do we need screenshots and who provides these screenshots?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the outcome of bad screenshots?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we do something about acquiring screenshots in a standard manner?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some best practices everyone can use for screenshots?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some examples of really useless screenshots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
