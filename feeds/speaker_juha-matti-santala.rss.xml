&lt;p&gt;Python is nearing 3 decades in existence (yes, kinda hard to believe). Where do we go from here? We have the same question, hence PyCon 2019 will be a peek into the future of Python. Come, hang out with an inspired crowd, have rich, direct conversations and who knows, maybe youâ€™ll even find an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet is full of data but it's not always easily obtainable in a format that is analyzable or presented in an optimal way. Data scraping - pulling data from websites - gives you access to a whole new world of working with data.&lt;/p&gt;
