Join us for a tour of the standard library where we'll dive into less-known modules that do well-known things and well-known modules that do less-known things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard Library Tour is designed to provide attendees with an understanding of Python's standard library less known features. Have you ever found yourself writing complex code only to discover that Python has tools available within its library that could have made your job easier? Then this talk is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outline of the talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic information about the library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well-known modules which do less-known things&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;functools less-known features: &amp;#64;singledispatch, partial(), &amp;#64;cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;itertools less-known features: product(), filterfalse(), zip_longest()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collections less-known features: ChainMap, defaultdict&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Less-known modules which do well-known things&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ul class="first last"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doctest for testing: testmod()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difflib &amp;amp; Filecmp for comparison: Difflib.SequenceMatcher, Filecmp.cmpfiles()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contextlib for tasks involving the with statement: &amp;#64;contextmanager, &amp;#64;asynccontextmanager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By attending this session, you'll gain a deeper understanding of Python's standard library and you'll discover the &amp;quot;unknown unknowns&amp;quot; - tools that you may not even know exist within Python's standard library. By becoming familiar with the library and all of its capabilities, you'll be better equipped to solve problems and build applications more efficiently, without reinventing the wheel. You'll also receive recommendations on where to find additional resources and information so you can continue learning and exploring Python's tools after the conference has ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer and the maintainer of several services, one of which is a
data visualization tool deployed in production across various companies,
I have had the unique opportunity to use Django ORM with FastAPI. If you
take a look through GitHub or other resources, you’ll notice there’s not
much out there about combining Django and FastAPI — it’s a bit of an
unconventional setup. The aim of my talk is to share insights from my
experience with this setup, highlighting its practical implementation
and the lessons learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at programmers from beginners to more experienced
ones familiar with either of these frameworks. You’ll gain insights into
combining asynchronous frameworks with synchronous ones, along with
understanding the benefits and challenges of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
