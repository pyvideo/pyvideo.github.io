Today, Jupyter is composed of powerful client-server applications and protocols for computing in many programming languages. This talk focuses on using these technologies for pedagogical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every course I have taught since the Fall semester of 2014 has been over the web via our JupyterHub server. These courses have included firstyear writing seminars, as well as courses in Programming Languages, Assembly Language, Introduction to Biology (in Python), and in Processing (Java-based). In this talk I hope to help identify best-practices for using Jupyter in the classroom. I will discuss and demonstrate tools and techniques, and explore the challenges of using Jupyter for teaching and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
