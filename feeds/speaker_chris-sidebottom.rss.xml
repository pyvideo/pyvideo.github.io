Taking the experience
of traditional TDD from a Web Development background and translating it
into useful techniques for Data Scientists. Hopefully by the end of this
talk TDD will be far less of a buzzword and you'll enjoy applying it
more yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning by introducing how I learnt TDD (Test Driven Development) from
Web Development. I’ll walk through how the traditional way of using TDD
sometimes doesn’t apply to Data Science. By exploring examples of
data-oriented TDD, I’ll show that even though TDD is a rigorous
practice, it can also be fun. And how TDD can provide you with more
space to explore how to build software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building upon the data testing, we’ll look at how to apply TDD to
machine learning models and why it’s tricky to build deterministic tests
for them. Then we’ll bring it altogether with pipeline testing, how it
can be difficult and ways to create tests that proxy it. I'll also cover
when not to use TDD, as that can ruin the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the talk, you should have ideas for implementing TDD in
your workflow with data. And ways to convince people to play along with
you!&lt;/p&gt;
