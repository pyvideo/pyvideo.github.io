laptops. For me, this often takes the form of SSH-ing into remote boxes
and manually configuring the system with a combination of apt installs,
Conda environments, and bash scripts. In this talk I will introduce
users to Ansible scripts for replacing this manual effort with simple,
reproducible, automated system configuration.Presenter(s): Speaker: Tim
