Except the term “bug” for an error was actually used before, for example in 1878 Thomas Edison in his letter to Theodore Puskas. Moreover, it wasn’t a true bug, it was a moth. And it wasn’t even Hopper who found the moth. Plenty of bugs in the bug’s story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software testing is full of myths, mythical silver bullets and “good” and bad practices. In this talk, I’ll debunk myths, share bad practices and explain how good practices can turn out to be not so good when applied in the real world of software engineering. All with focus on our beloved Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples are unit tests tightly coupled to implementation details, always unstable integration tests and targeting 100 % code coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
