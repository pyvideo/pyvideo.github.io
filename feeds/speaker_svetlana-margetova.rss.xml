However, if you want to use it with Django or other Python framework,
there are some design patterns and best practices that worked for me and
we've used them at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are building Single Page App using React and Django we had to
think about the way we did APIs, the way rendered templates, the way
about security, the way about speed page and how to reuse our API for
mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show you how to use these technologies, difference between MVC
and SPA development, best practices and good tools for large projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking about building your project with JavaScript, I will
give you some tips and points to light your way.&lt;/p&gt;
