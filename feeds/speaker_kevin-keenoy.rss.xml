&lt;p&gt;The public sector can use the Digital Marketplace (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/"&gt;https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/&lt;/a&gt;) to find people and technology for digital projects. Over £1,000,000,000 has been spent on cloud services by government through the G-Cloud framework since it launched in 2012, over half of that spend being with SMEs rather than big systems integrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014 the Digital Marketplace was a single Grails application (written in Groovy, running on the JVM) that provided a simple searchable catalogue of cloud services. Applications from suppliers to provide their services were handled externally by two separate systems run by the Crown Commercial Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then we have rebuilt the Digital Marketplace from scratch in Python as a RESTful system of Flask applications and expanded its functionality to supplant these external systems. It is now on its way to becoming a general-purpose platform for handling suppliers’ applications to sell their services to government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain how the the architecture of the system has evolved over a series of iterations of supplier application processes, and also delve deeper into how we drive both the frontend applications and data validation from a separate “content repository” of YAML files that can be maintained by content designers rather than developers.&lt;/p&gt;
