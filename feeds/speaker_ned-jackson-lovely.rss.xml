remember the community with a fondness that likely doesn't accurately
reflect the former reality. We'll explore how we can take a set of
articles from an online community and winnow out the stuff we feel is
unworthy. We'll explore some of the machine learning tools that are just
a &amp;quot;pip install&amp;quot; away, such as scikit-learn and nltk.&lt;/p&gt;

build computer controlled helicopters you can fly around your living
room for surprisingly small amounts of money. This talk will describe
the steps you'll need to take to start the ball rolling towards Skynet
using a $20 helicopter and an Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;
