You have been
using Jupyter and Python to do some interesting research, build
models, visualize results. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to
easily go from a notebook to a Flask web application which you can
share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter is a great notebook environment for Python based data science
and exploratory data analysis. You can share the notebooks via a
github repository, as html or even on the web using something like
JupyterHub. How can we turn the work we have done in the notebook into
a real web application?&lt;/p&gt;
