&lt;p&gt;This talk is intended to introduce people to building, changing and
managing infrastructure with Terraform, using a working example.
Infrastructure-as-code is more important now than it's ever been and
Terraform is one of the biggest and most useful tools in current use.
The talk will cover the core concepts, with a working example to help
people get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software industry as a whole is moving further towards integrating smaller systems together rather than building monoliths. This can be trickier than it appears, especially when the system needs to grow and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is meant to help highlight some of the pitfalls that can trip up teams who may be used to creating smaller systems or monoliths, take a look at deployment, scaling and monitoring and discuss issues that are still problematic for us here at EnergyDeck.&lt;/p&gt;
