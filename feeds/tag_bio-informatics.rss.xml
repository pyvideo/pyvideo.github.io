able to collect data in greater volumes and with finer resolution. There
has been a growing interest in leveraging this vast volume of data
across levels of analysis, measurement techniques, and experimental
paradigms to gain more insight into brain function. At multiple stages
and levels of neuroscience investigation, ML holds great promise as an
addition to the arsenal of analysis tools for discovering how the brain
works. As quantitative analysis of brain MRI is routine for many
neurological diseases and conditions, deep learning-based segmentation
approaches for brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are gaining
interest due to their self-learning and generalisation ability over
large amounts of data. On the other hand, High Performance Computing
(HPC) and AI will increasingly intertwine as we transition to an
exascale future using new computing, storage, and communications
technologies. In this talk I will walk you through fundamentals of
generating high- performance deep-learning models in TensorFlow platform
using Python on large computing system (e.g NVIDIA® Tesla® GPUs powered
by Tensor Cores), in order to infer and segment thousands of cell
centroids out of the brain objects of interest. From a more
technological perspective, although astonishing results have been
achieved concerning the distribution of training large convolutional
neural networks on big data, to date the Python scientific ecosystem is
still missing tools for an optimised and, above all, distributed
inference of deep learning models. In this talk I will show you how a
tiling-based inferencing approach could be a good solution to remedy the
problem. The talk is intended for intermediate PyData researchers and
practitioners. Basic to intermediate level experience in image
recognition/object detection deep learning applications is assumed.
Overall, a good proficiency with the Python language and with scientific
python libraries (e.g. numpy, TensorFlow, Keras) are required for the
entire talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://slides.com/ferranmuinos/deck#/"&gt;Using votes to combine
rankings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to best combine the outcome of several ranked data into a single,
meaningful consensus ranking is a recurrent problem in scientific data
analysis. Particularly, in genome data analysis we are often bound to
merge ranked data arising from separate statistical analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional blending strategies applied in the field rely on techniques
to combine statistical significance, but this approach on its own has
been associated with a number of caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hereto present a voting-based heuristics implemented in Python which
leverages both Schulze’s voting algorithm and optimization techniques to
combine rankings upon credibility scores inferred from prior knowledge.
This rationale can be used alongside state-of-the-art methods to
systematically incorporate prior knowledge, thereby leading to more
interpretable outcomes. The scope of the method is quite general and may
be of use in other data analysis contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To showcase a scientific data analysis problem arising from the study of
cancer biology and how we approached it by implementing our own tool in
Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target Audience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk aims to a broad Python audience. Minimum Python fluency is
required. Acquaintance with basic notions of data analysis may be
helpful to best follow the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
