Tutorials, How-to topics, and References. Each addresses a different
customer need and each requires different amounts of time and types of
resources to produce. However, what happens on that fateful day you find
that you have more documentation to write than time will allow? (As a
technical writer, I call those weekdays). How can you prioritize which
documentation type and how much of it should be written and which topics
to write first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk provides guidance and encouragement to technical writers to
help them get the information they need to strategically get the right
docs to the right people at the right time—and learn a little bit more
about their stakeholders along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

their applications. As a technical writer at Stripe, I’m partially
responsible for maintaining 150 code examples, each of which needs to be
in 8 programming languages. In this presentation, I’ll explain the
processes we’re using, the hurdles we’re facing, and the solutions we’ve
devised thus far to make and maintain code examples that really shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific concepts covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defining a style guide for your code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating code examples programmatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing examples to ensure they work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using common snippets to save time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhancing examples for a better user experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we haven’t solved all our problems in this area, we’ve made
great progress with great results, and I look forward to sharing our
best policies and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

all without damaging our velocity.&lt;/p&gt;

wide array of backgrounds, from screenwriters to college students, how
we made sense of the answers we got through an unpredictable set of

aptitude, but no real-world experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cue the panic: There are too many things to do! Where do I start? How
can I succeed in this role?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been there before. In fact, I’ve done it multiple times. Like
medical triage, you won’t have a lot of time to think before you dive in
and get to work. It’s stressful, even if there are no lives at stake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can be fast and smart. I’ll tell you how to get started (audit
the existing content, create a list of requirements for documentation
tools, ruthlessly prioritize a huge list of tasks) and how to keep going
(build relationships with coworkers in customer-facing roles to learn
what your customers really need from docs, take a moment to pat yourself
on the back every now and then). I’ll also admit to mistakes I’ve made,
and how I’ve learned to avoid them (like trying to do everything myself,
or thinking that time spent planning is taking away from “real work”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your new role will require hard work, but a bit of advice can help you
get started, stay motivated, and avoid pitfalls along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll share the story of Twilio’s journey toward
empathy-driven documentation. By leveraging direct user feedback, user
experience research, and constantly testing the effectiveness of the
docs you provide, you can learn how your users work with (and wish they
could work with) your docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way I’ll share a few tips about what worked well for us, what
ideas didn’t pan out, and some of the documentation principles we’re now
sold on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a portfolio is an exercise in documenting yourself: your
writing, your skill, your journey as a professional. Like any other kind
of documentation, it isn't easy or intuitive to create something great.
And like any other kind of documentation, it's worth doing the hard work
to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why you need a portfolio even if you have a stable job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to create a well-rounded portfolio and decide what's your best

&lt;li&gt;Strategies for adding proprietary work (legally!)&lt;/li&gt;

up walls of text. However, screenshots can carry a lot of overhead,
including localization considerations and short shelf-lives due to
continuous deployment, which may make them more effort than their worth.
For content that appears in context of the UI, screenshots can also be
redundant and unnecessary. As alternatives to screenshots, there are
several visual content strategies to consider to engage audiences and
convey and complement concepts and UIisms, including infographics,
illustrations, and abstract &amp;quot;simplified UI (SUI)&amp;quot; representations. Which
you use depends on your intent and message.&lt;/p&gt;

humans to create, publish and present technical content in a variety of
media. Primarily in text, in the context of a blog or other ‘managed’
calendar-driven web publications. Not technical documentation. Sometimes
it’s a mighty fine line between docs and blogs, but I think we can and
should differentiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore principles and patterns of kind, effective
editorial practice, and nuances of voice, civility, and clear
communication, as they play out when working with a diverse distributed
roster of authors, many of whom are non-native English speakers or
first-time storytellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there’s as much appetite for diversity of voice and point of
view in blogging about software development as there is in speaking
about it at developer conferences. And I’ve got some observations to
share about how we can cultivate that.&lt;/p&gt;

our docs so it’s time to step up our research game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grounded in the things I’ve learnt (read: mistakes I’ve made) from my
time writing open source documentation for the UK government at
Government Digital Service (GDS), this talk will look at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deciding what - and how - to research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interviewing, simulation and content evaluation techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distinguishing user ‘needs’ from ‘wants’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how the Hawthorne effect can influence research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to feed findings into product and content development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout it all, we’ll cover strategies to avoid common pitfalls, how
to avoid users telling you what you want to hear, how to manage research
with no extra budget and, when it’s all done, how to turn all that
qualitative data into tangible content changes that have a genuine
impact for users.&lt;/p&gt;

fellow organizers understand and more correctly wield technology in
service of their mission. Using my blogpost &amp;quot;Three Tips for Providing
Tech Help to Non-Profits and Other Such Organizations&amp;quot; as a point of
departure, I will share my experience and derived best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &amp;quot;basics&amp;quot;, like how to use documents and spreadsheets, to working
with databases and understanding security, I have given assistance to a
great many groups and the most important part is always the
documentation that I leave behind. I can rarely ever just point people
to the official software or open source project documentation, I almost
always have to rewrite the docs for them in simple language that
references their specific use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish to help community and activist groups make better technical
choices so that they feel more in control of the technologies they use.
My hope is that in sharing my experiences, I can engage in a deeper
dialogue with the technical documentation community about how we can
make technical documentation more accessible, easier to re-use, and
empowering.&lt;/p&gt;

be certain that developers can’t write good help: the prevailing sense
is “Only we can do this.” But those same tech writers often feel under
threat in their jobs - feeling like their organisation doesn’t see their
value, doesn’t understand what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; write the docs? Should all developers write docs as a
matter of course? Is it even worthwhile having specialist writers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I’ll try to find some answers to these questions, based on
my experience working in many teams - both in teams that have valued
tech writing and in teams that haven’t. I’ll talk about the
‘documentarian’ mindset and how that contributes to better software, no
matter what your job title is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll also explore the benefits that come from specialist writers and
generalist developers working together. And I’ll share the ways I’ve
found that people with specialist writer skills (whether they’re
developers, tech writers, or other roles) can make the biggest
difference to user experience, and through that to their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

about a new technology that nobody's written about yet. Maybe you're
unimpressed with the books that are out there on your favorite topic.
Maybe writing a book is on your bucket list. This session will help your
idea reach its potential as a published book. Technical publishing is an
opaque process with a lot of moving parts, which can be confusing for
outsiders to navigate. This session will guide you through the steps you
should take to turn an idea into a proposal that a publisher will
accept, and what to expect from the publishing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a great technical book takes more than a good idea. It also
requires a knowledge of the market, to determine whether there's an
audience willing to buy, or whether the space is too crowded to accept
new entries. Publishers vary in their approach and target markets, so
you need to determine which one will provide the best chance of success.
Self-publishing is an option, but carries its own risks and benefits.
Doing the setup work that you may not have thought about yet will help
you create a proposal that will appeal to publishers, and will also make
the writing process easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a contract with a publisher, or have decided to
self-publish, it's more than just a matter of putting the words in
order. Finding the right environment, setting a schedule, and
communicating with your editor are all critical to success. This session
will explain how the process works, highlight the parts you may not
know, and give you advice on how not to get overwhelmed by your project.&lt;/p&gt;
