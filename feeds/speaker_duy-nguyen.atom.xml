However, I don't love how some players make the
community less welcoming towards beginners by hiding their strategies.
So I did what any defiant engineer would. I signed up for a free AWS
account and began (responsibly) scraping millions of their
unauthenticated Pokemon battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll journey together through this passion project of mine and draw on
specific examples to better understand the trade-offs of working with
distributed systems or microservice architectures in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
