&lt;p&gt;The goal is to have simpler internals to allow experimenting with changes to the language more easily. This interpreter has a small core with much of the library modifiable at run time for quickly testing changes. This differs from Pypy that aimed for full Python compatibility and speed (from JIT compilation). I will show some of the interesting things that you can do with this interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interpreter has two parts: a parser to transform source to Abstract Syntax Tree and a runner for traversing this tree. I will give an overview of how both part work and discuss some challenges encountered and their solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interpreter makes use of very few libraries, and only those included with CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is looking for members to discuss ways of simplifying parts of the interpreter (among other things).&lt;/p&gt;
