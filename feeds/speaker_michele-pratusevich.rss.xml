emotion to our images. Do you want to explore what makes up Instagram
filters? In this talk, we will talk about the basic elements of
Instagram filters and implement them in Python. The staple libraries we
will use are scikit-image and numpy - matplotlib and jupyter notebooks
for plotting and interactivity. In the end, we will implement the
(now-defunct) Gotham Instagram filter in 15 lines of Python (not
including imports). Throughout the process, there will be many pretty
pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
