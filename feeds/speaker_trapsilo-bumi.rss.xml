Together we will explore some occurences of out-of-ordinary encodings and how to handle them properly in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

This
instrument has a lot of variety in how it is performed; a common format
is the orchestral format in which 15-30 players gather to form a team.
Playing Angklung in this way is fun but also presents some challenges
that are hard to solve manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I will introduce you to the instrument and how it works/how it is
played. Then, I will show you how Python-based algorithms can be used to
ease the pains of managing Angklung teams, by reading Angklung-specific
sheet music and calculating the most optimal distribution of Angklung
based on several important factors.&lt;/p&gt;
