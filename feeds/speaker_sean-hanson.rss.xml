In this talk, I’ll coin the term “Quiet Developer” for developers who are active, engaged, but to the eyes of many completely invisible for many reasons. I’ll dive into how developers like us survive, how hiring practices around us need to change, what employers can do to empower us, and in doing so finally chip away at the monolithic idea of “community engagement”, highlighting instead the many less-visible communities so many of us are part of.&lt;/p&gt;
