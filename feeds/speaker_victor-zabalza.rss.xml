To this end, data scientists spend a significant part of their time carrying out data quality assessments and data exploration. In spite of this being a crucial step, it usually requires repeating a series of menial tasks before the data scientist gains an understanding ofthe dataset and can progress to the next steps in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will detail the inner workings of a Python package that we have built which automates this drudge work, enables efficient data exploration, and kickstarts data science projects. A summary is generated for each dataset, including:     General information about the dataset, including data quality of each of the columns;     Distribution of each of the columns through statistics and plots (histogram, CDF, KDE), optionally grouped by other categorical variables;     2D distribution between pairs of columns;     Correlation coefficient matrix for all numerical columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building this tool has provided a unique view into the full Python data stack, from the parallelised analysis of a dataframe within a Dask custom execution graph, to the interactive visualisation with Jupyter widgets and Plotly. During the talk, I will also introduce how Dask works, and demonstrate how to migrate data pipelines to take advantage of its scalable capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
