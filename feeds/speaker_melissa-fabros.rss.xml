&lt;p&gt;Description
Kiva has provided an enormous amount of data transparency for over a decade. The data has powered economics studies and machine learning research. Attendees will be introduced to the one of the largest publicly available data sets for micro finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Kiva has supported a thoroughly documented REST api that resulted in many academic research papers that can be found at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.kiva.org/build/research"&gt;https://www.kiva.org/build/research&lt;/a&gt; as well as applications such as KivaLens (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kivalens.org/#/search"&gt;http://www.kivalens.org/#/search&lt;/a&gt;) , &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kivajapan.org/"&gt;http://www.kivajapan.org/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.wakibi.nl/"&gt;https://www.wakibi.nl/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces the work completed around use of Kiva's open data, as well as an introduction to Kiva's GraphQL api and an announcement of the deprecation of the REST api.&lt;/p&gt;
