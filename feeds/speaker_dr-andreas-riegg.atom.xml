with IBM and Google on Quantum Computing. When doing concrete
experiments with the Quantum Computing cloud based offerings, two
different Python libraries provided by IBM and Google are used. They are
named QISKIT in the case of IBM and CIRQ in the case of Google. The
experiments with both libraries are handled using appropriate Jupyter
Notebooks. This talk gives a brief introduction on Quantum Computing,
specifically on Quantum Computers based on transmon-based QBits. This is
followed by an introduction of the both Python libraries that are used.
Then some details about the Jupyter notebooks that are used are given.
The talk will finish with some demos and an overview about the most
important practical experiences with both Quantum Computing offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
