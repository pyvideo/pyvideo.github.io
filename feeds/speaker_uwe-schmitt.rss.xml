applications designed for specific applications without support for
customization. In addition, many of the commercial solutions offer no or
only limited functionality for exporting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the existing programming libraries in this area are
scattered across different languages, mostly R, Java and Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, data analysis in this area often consists of manual
import/export steps from/to various tools and self-developed scripts
that prevent the reproducibility of results obtained or automated
execution on high-performance infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;emzed tries to avoid these problems by integrating existing libraries
and tools from Python, R (and in the near future also Java) into an
easy-to-use API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;To support workflow development and increase confidence in end results&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;emzed also offers tools for interactive visualization of mass
spectrometry related data structures.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation introduces basics and concepts of emzed, some lessons
learned and current development of the next version of emzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about emzed, a Python library to support biologists with
little programming knowledge to implement ad-hoc analyses as well as
workflows for mass-spectrometry data.&lt;/p&gt;
