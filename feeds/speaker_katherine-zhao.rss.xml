to the problem-solving skills that are at the core of computer science.
As coordinators, we found that there is a lot of undiscovered talent and
enthusiasm for CS in the younger generation. Our poster is meant to
encourage discussions on intuitive ways to introduce programming and
interesting projects for novice programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
