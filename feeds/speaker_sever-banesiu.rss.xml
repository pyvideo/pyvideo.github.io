[EuroPython 2015]
[20 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation introduces Flowy, a library for building and running
distributed, asynchronous workflows built on top of different backends
(such as Amazonâ€™s SWF). Flowy deals away with the spaghetti code that
often crops up from orchestrating complex workflows. It is ideal for
applications that do multi-phased batch processing, media encoding,
long-running tasks, and/or background processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll start by discussing Flowy's unique execution model and see how
different execution topologies can be implemented on top of it. During
the talk we'll run and visualize workflows using a local backend.
We'll then take a look at what it takes to scale beyond a single
machine by using an external service like SWF.&lt;/p&gt;
