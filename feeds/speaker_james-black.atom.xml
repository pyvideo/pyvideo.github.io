&lt;p&gt;Platform owners often ask questions like ‘how quickly do users migrate to new versions of R’, ‘what programming languages are used’, and ‘how are internal packages, dashboards and outputs consumed’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to these questions and many more lives within the operational logs collected by systems like Posit Connect, Github, and AWS. I’ll share examples of how we use this data at Roche to shape our product roadmap. I’ll also share some ideas we are exploring to use this data to help empower our data scientists to understand the hidden consequence of how they work through feeding back personal cost and environmental impact - enabling informed decisions, e.g., what it means to schedule a pin to update daily, or request 2 vs 8 cores.&lt;/p&gt;
