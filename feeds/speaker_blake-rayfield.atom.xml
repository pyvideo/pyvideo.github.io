adopted by a broad community of users. For educators of all levels,
Python has become a go-to programming language. However, while there are
ways to distribute creations in Python, they tend to be notoriously
complex, unreliable, or require additional services like web hosting.
With the creation of Pyscript, Python projects can be distributed with
little to no web hosting or even internet connectivity. This change can
potentially bring previously inaccessible topics or tools to a broader
community while increasing the popularity of Python. This talk will
describe and demonstrate Python and Pyscript's potential opportunities
in the education space. We will talk about what makes these tools
different than those previously available and how the future development
of Pyscript can drive additional education changes in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
