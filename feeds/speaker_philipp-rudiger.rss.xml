Here we describe how the new HoloViews Python package, combined with the IPython Notebook, provides a rich interface for flexible and nearly code-free visualization of your results while storing a full record.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk we will discover how to leverage Panel and Lumen to develop data applications by iterating in a notebook, previewing and finally deploying it to a JupyterHub or to an external cloud provider - all without leaving the JupyterLab UI. Along the way we will explore best practices for structuring these applications and make them performant. We will also explore the integration of these tools with the rest of the Jupyter ecosystem, e.g. by leveraging Jupyter Widgets, and deploy them in applications running outside Jupyter on the Panel server. In doing so we will discover the power of Jupyter not just for exploratory workflows but for sharing complex and rich data applications with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing &amp;amp; Iterating
In the first section we will go over the development of a rich and powerful data application in a notebook. We will demonstrate how we can quickly build and preview individual components by displaying them inline and previewing the entire application using a JupyterLab extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have built the application we will go over recommendations for structuring the application to make them easier to maintain but also to achieve a good look and feel and get the best performance out of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter Widgets integration
Next we will go over the integrations of the Panel and Lumen stack with the Jupyter Widgets ecosystem. The ability to leverage this existing ecosystem allows users to leverage the tools they love and allows taking Jupyter Widgets out of Jupyter and ship them in a standalone application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment
Lastly we will demonstrate how we can easily deploy Panel applications in a JupyterHub environment using existing extensions like CDSDashboards and how we can begin to extend this with Jupyter extensions that provide UIs to deploy to a cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Track: PyData: Visualization
Do you use the &lt;cite&gt;.plot()&lt;/cite&gt; API of pandas or xarray? Do you ever wish it was easier for you or your collaborators to try out different combinations of the parameters in your data-processing pipeline? This tutorial will introduce you to [hvPlot](&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hvplot.holoviz.org/"&gt;https://hvplot.holoviz.org/&lt;/a&gt;), a library that:
* supercharges the &lt;cite&gt;.plot&lt;/cite&gt; API with extra capabilities like interactive plots, rendering of very large datasets, and simple composition and linking of plots, and
* makes it really easy to build interactive web applications, whether to make data exploration easier for yourself or for sharing your results with others, by simply replacing arguments in your method calls with widgets.&lt;/p&gt;

This presentation will show step by step how to make and deploy a concise, fast, and fully reproducible recipe for interactive visualization of millions or billions of datapoints using very few lines of Python in a Jupyter notebook using a combination of the HoloViews, Datashader, Dask, Bokeh and paramNB libraries and deployed as a Jupyter Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

Compared to other approaches, Panel is novel in that it works across nearly all plotting libraries, works just as well in a Jupyter notebook as on a standalone secure web server, uses the same code for both those cases, supports both Python-backed and static HTML/JavaScript exported applications, and can be used to develop rich interactive applications without tying your domain-specific code to any particular GUI or web tools.&lt;/p&gt;

You'll learn how to use Panel to lay out your existing plots with widgets to make apps in the notebook or as deployed dashboards, hvPlot to make your Pandas or Xarray .plot() API calls return interactive, explorable plots, HoloViews and GeoViews to help you explore multidimensional data naturally without having to build a plot for each combination or sample of the data space, and Datashader to visualize even the very largest datasets faithfully in a web browser. See pyviz.org for links to all these tools and more.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">James Bednar</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:pyvideo.org,2019-07-11:/scipy-2019/visualize-any-data-easily-from-notebooks-to-dashboards.html</guid><category>SciPy 2019</category><category>tutorial</category></item><item><title>hvPlot &amp; HoloViz</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/scipy-2022/hvplot-holoviz.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python offers many powerful visualization tools, each with their own strengths and advantages, but few people have the time and interest to learn all the different APIs required to use these different tools. Luckily, a de-facto standard API for data plotting has emerged in the Pandas .plot() API, which is now supported by many different plotting packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you will learn how to use hvPlot, a high-level interactive plotting library that exposes the power of Bokeh, Matplotlib, Plotly, Datashader, and Cartopy using the same .plot API you may already know from using Pandas or Xarray's plotting interface. We'll also show you how to turn nearly any expression you can write with that API into a web app with plots and tables by simply substituting widgets for any parameters you want users to be able to select. Thanks to the HoloViz tools on which hvPlot is built, the resulting apps can easily handle big data (up to billions of rows on an ordinary laptop), remote data (either in Jupyter or in standalone apps), streaming data (using streaming dataframe libraries), geographical data (building on the geoscience software stack), or multidimensional data (using Xarray).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hvPlot's high-level interface should be sufficient for nearly all of the common data-exploration and data-analysis tasks you want to do with Pandas or Xarray, but in keeping with the HoloViz philosophy of &amp;quot;&amp;quot;shortcuts rather than dead ends&amp;quot;&amp;quot;, we'll also show you how and when to drop down to lower-level APIs when you need to, such as when building more complex apps using Panel, doing complex graphical data calculations using Datashader, or integrating plotting and interactivity into your own libraries using Param and HoloViews. With the techniques you learn in the hands-on exercises in this tutorial, you'll get the tools and know-how to effectively explore, analyze and visualize simple or complex, small or large, and static or dynamic data easily, concisely, and reproducibly. We expect participants to have previously used some sort of plotting tool and to be comfortable with Python and at least one array-based library (Numpy, Pandas, Xarray, CuPy, cuDF, Dask, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
