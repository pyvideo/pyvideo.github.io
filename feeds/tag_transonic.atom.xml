There are more than one framework to achieve this (for example, Cython, Pythran and Numba) with similar syntaxes but different underlying implementations. The talk surveys the state of the art of creating extensions and introduces Transonic (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://transonic.readthedocs.io"&gt;https://transonic.readthedocs.io&lt;/a&gt;). Transonic is a pure-Python package acting as a unifying front-end for writing extensions with the aim to enhance the developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
