&lt;p&gt;Query Embeddings is an unsupervised deep learning based system, built
using Python and open source libraries (Annoy, keyvi etc.) which
recognizes similarity between queries and their vector
representations, for a web scale search engine integrated within Cliqz
browser [&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cliqz.com/en"&gt;https://cliqz.com/en&lt;/a&gt;]. It improves recall for previously
unseen queries and is one of the many key components of our search
stack. The framework be utilized by other low latency systems
involving vector representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A web search engine allows a user to type few words of query and it
presents list of potential relevant results within fraction of a
second. Traditionally, keywords in the user query were fuzzy-matched
in realtime with the keywords within different pages of the index and
they didn't really focus on understanding meaning of query. Recently,
Deep Learning + NLP techniques try to &lt;em&gt;represent sentences or
documents as fixed dimensional vectors in high dimensional space&lt;/em&gt;.
These special vectors inherit semantics of the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Query embeddings is an unsupervised deep learning based system, built
using Python, Word2Vec, Annoy and Keyvi (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cliqz"&gt;https://github.com/cliqz&lt;/a&gt;-
oss/keyvi) which recognizes similarity between queries and their
vectors  for a web scale search engine within Cliqz browser.

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to describe how query embeddings contribute to our
existing python search stack at scale and latency issues prevailing in
real time search system.  Also is a preview of separate vector index
for queries, utilized by retrieval system at runtime via ANNs to get
closest queries to user query, which is one of the many key components
of our search stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prerequisites: Basic experience in NLP, ML, Deep Learning, Web search
and Vector Algebra. Libraries:  Annoy.&lt;/p&gt;
