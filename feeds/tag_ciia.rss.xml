&lt;p&gt;Resumo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe a SCADA system build with Python with an home brew protocol called Mara for a power substation as part of a research and development project in UNPJSB of Trelew city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will describe some of the challenges faced during its development and how they were overcome. Specially non functional requirements such as reliability and low latency (MQTT, AMQP and STOMP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we will cover how we're iterating over its architecture to provide a more suitable solution for IoT field and how we're using Python at lower levels PlatformIO and how we plan to integrate CIAA (Argentine Open Industrial Computer).&lt;/p&gt;
