made easier using python tool kits. How can we set up pipeline
starting from scratch to the specific solution using Python tools. I
have been using python from last 5-6 years and my main area of
research is language processing and information retrieval. I have used
python tools previously on various projects and problems related to
Sentiment analysis, Text processing, Summarization , Classification
etc. For details you can check out my profile &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://computing.dcu.ie/~parora/"&gt;http://computing.dcu.ie/~parora/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to talk about main 2 aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based Raw Text processing: using NLTK toolkit and other plugins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep learning: using Gensim toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the time availability I would like to have some hands-on
experience or have some live coding to make the talk interactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my PhD and collaborative projects with researchers and
industries I have discovered sometime starting from scratch seems
quite complicated and can take lots of time and resources, but how can
we speed up that process and focus on the main innovative solution is
the main key resources, which I would like to address and discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
