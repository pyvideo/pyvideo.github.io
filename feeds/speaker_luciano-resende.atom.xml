In this talk, we will introduce you to Elyra, an open-source AI development workspace that enables data scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and AI developers to be more productive. It provides support for low code/no code AI Pipelines integrated with Apache Airflow and Kubeflow runtimes, integrated Python, Scala, and R editors, collaboration support via git integration, code reusability via code snippets, etc all without having to leave your Notebook workspace. After a quick introduction to Elyra's capabilities, we will dive into a live demo, showcasing how to build and execute a data pipeline in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

However, with the popularity of big data analytics and complex deep learning workloads, there is a growing requirement to extend the computation across a cluster of computers in a parallel fashion. In this talk, we will describe how to use multiple Jupyter Notebook components to enable the orchestration and distribution of interactive machine learning and deep learning workloads across different types of computing clusters including Apache Spark and Kubernetes. This talk is intended to attendees interested in distributed platforms and scientists experiencing difficulties on scaling their scientific workloads across multiple machines.
