may make it appear esoteric and daunting, but in reality, if you are
familiar with traditional machine learning, you're more than ready to
start exploring deep learning. This talk aims to gently bridge the
divide by demonstrating how deep learning operates on core machine
learning concepts and getting attendees started coding deep neural
networks using Google's TensorFlow library.&lt;/p&gt;

features, been disappointed with the results, and wanted to know where
to go next? This talk shows how to add your own feature Pipelines and
how to tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. We'll apply this to the
problem of classifying streetnames in Singapore by linguistic origin,
and turn the results into a colour-coded street map.&lt;/p&gt;
