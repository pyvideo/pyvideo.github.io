more support subgroups for minorities in Python: whether, at the end of
the day, the community would be more segregated than united. When I
passed this on to a few people, a new demand emerged: that there were
difficulties in creating more diverse teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the organization of meetups, regional events and ethnographic
research among different tech communities, this talk seeks not only to
present possible solutions for increasing diversity in python
environments (such as academia, companies and communities), but also to
instigate debate about where we can improve and how to truly listen to
pythonistas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk also aims to explore already established tools - such as the
Code of Conduct - and evolve them in the light of new minorities and to
provide a safe space for learning and connections.&lt;/p&gt;
