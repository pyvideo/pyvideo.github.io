&lt;p&gt;We will cover the basics concepts and tools for Python packaging. Then we will introduce a few suggested schemes for how to package a machine learning project, followed by some tips and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will wrap up with a few additional concerns related to creating quality projects and packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good precursor to the talk is a blog that I wrote as a companion to this talk. It can be found at blog.stevencutting.com.&lt;/p&gt;
