With this new tool, deep machine learning transitions from an area of research into mainstream software engineering. In this session, we will teach you how to choose the right neural network for your problem and how to make it behave. Familiarity with differential equations is no longer required. Instead, a couple of lines ofTensorflow Python, and a bag of &amp;quot;tricks of the trade&amp;quot; will do the job. No previous Python knowledge required.&lt;/p&gt;
