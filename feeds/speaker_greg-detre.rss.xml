two steps back. We need to become scientists about our own product - run
an AB test comparing two versions and measure which works better. We'll
talk through a simple but effective backend AB testing framework in
Python (using Django as an example), along with some of the issues,
gotchas and best practices of running AB tests in production.&lt;/p&gt;
