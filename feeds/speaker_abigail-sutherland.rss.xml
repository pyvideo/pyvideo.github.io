My title is &amp;quot;Information Architect&amp;quot;, but that’s mostly
because &amp;quot;She Who Figures Out What We Need To Do About Our Documentation
And Does It&amp;quot; is too wordy for HR. I work in a product unit of about 350
people creating software for developers, very few of them skilled
writers or native speakers of English. My role is to figure out how we
can produce good documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a problem of scale: I can’t do all of the technical writing we
need. So instead, I’ve become a contagious documentarian. Over the last
year, I’ve [STRIKEOUT:infected] taught technical writing to over 200
people around my company. My 3 1/2 hour course, &amp;quot;Technical Writing for
Techies&amp;quot;, is popular, and seems to be effective. There’s been a
noticeable improvement in the writing we’re producing, and (even better)
an awareness that good writing is an achievable, even enjoyable, thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I describe the course formally, I tend to list attendee objectives
such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about the audience and how to write for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study and practice different writing techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand and use a style guide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn ways to improve word choice and sentence structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study the commonest mistakes that non‐native speakers make in English
and how to correct them. (etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do cover all of those topics. But just between us, my real
objectives for my students are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay awake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel welcome and relaxed enough to participate openly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish the course feeling competent and capable about writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust the Information Architect enough to come to her with future
problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to be part of a community of documentarians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll talk about the course structure, some of the ways I’ve designed and
delivered it to meet both sets of objectives, how it has evolved over
time, and what I’ve learned while giving it.&lt;/p&gt;
