In this talk, I'll highlight some of the improvements to Quarto since then. You'll learn about new formats, options, tools, and ways to supercharge your content. And, if you haven't used Quarto yet, come to see some reasons to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join us for our first Posit Conf 2024 keynote, where we’ll tell you about our mission, our products, and some of the exciting things we’ve been working on over the last year. Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist, will talk briefly about Posit’s mission and products, before introducing the three speakers who will update you on some of the coolest projects we’ve worked on over the last year. James Blair, Senior Product Manager, will give you the latest on our partnerships with Databricks and Snowflake, and how we’re building seamless integrations that let you focus on data science instead of dealing with technical details.
