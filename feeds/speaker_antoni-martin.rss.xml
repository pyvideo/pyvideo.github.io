Specifically, we will cover the results of our latency and throughput experiments with a range of LLM models, ranging from encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only transformer models. We will talk about performance comparisons with other approaches in the field as well as our collaboration with the core PyTorch team to fix some of the bugs we have encountered when using features such as dynamic shapes and CUDA graph trees. We will also comment on how we have been using the torch.compile() API to compile and run models on IBM’s AIU accelerator and why we have made that choice. Finally, we will also cover the interaction of parallel approaches such as Tensor Parallel for bigger models combined with Compile for inference workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
