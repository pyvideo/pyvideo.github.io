If the end users are not involved in the process from the start the tool we built may not meet their needs. In this presentation, I will discuss how prototyping in Shiny can help you build the right tool and save you from spending millions of dollars on a tool no one will use. I will explore the advantages of using Shiny for prototyping, particularly its ability to rapidly build interactive applications. I will also discuss how to design effective prototypes, including techniques for gathering user feedback and using that feedback to refine your tool. I will emphasize the importance of presenting real-life data, particularly when building data-driven tools.&lt;/p&gt;
