to develop documentation. When well designed, this approach increases
documentation velocity and reduces bottlenecks. However, there are (at
least) two huge challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping documentation quality high&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring that content gets developed in line with the products and
services it supports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While no doc set will ever be perfect, there is hope for overcoming
these challenges. In this talk, I'll share lessons learned from working
through these challenges at companies of various sizes. We'll walk
through content management best practices, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting occasional authors up for success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building an effective writing toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defining content management strategies for globally distributed teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
