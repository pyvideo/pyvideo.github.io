A Bayesianâ€™s Answer with Stan</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/scipy-2018/should-this-drug-be-approved-a-bayesians-answer-with-stan.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayesian hierarchical models can be used for a variety of purposes,
including prediction and causal inference from experimental and
observational studies. The benefits of Bayesian modeling include
uncertainty quantification for all model parameters and predictions, as
well as the ability to interpret the outcome. Unfortunately, Bayesian
inference, the process of fitting such models to datasets, is hard to
implement. Stan is the state-of-the-art, open-source Bayesian inference
engine which makes Bayesian inference much easier to use. We illustrate
this with an application of Bayesian modeling in the field of clinical
research, assessing the safety of approving a drug for market. To do
this, we use PyStan, the Python interface to Stan.Presenter(s): Speaker:
