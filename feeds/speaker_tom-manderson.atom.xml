Unfortunately, there are a few use cases where it's remarkably bad. Learn about why you might want a task queue (and when you definitely don't), when Celery is appropriate, and what you can do when it's not.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, a lot of those are invalid. From version 3.5 onwards, Python has had a standardised system for adding types to your Python programs so you can increase your confidence in your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By gradually adding types to your Python programs you can get the best of both worlds - add static types where they're useful, but retain the flexibility of dynamic typing where you want it. The talk covers a little of the history of typechecking in Python, some short demos, and a brief report on adding types to an existing project.&lt;/p&gt;
