User assistance (documentation) is basically self-service customer support. Both documentation and customer support are critical to the success of any company, and they work better when they assist and improve each other. How can tap the knowledge of our support agents to improve the documentation, and how can we make the lives of support agents easier in return?
I’ve worked very closely with customer support and customer success teams for years, and I’ve gone from thinking of them as “the RTFM, turn if off an on again folks” to being their biggest advocate and fan.
Let me tell you how documentarians can work with customer support to turn the F in RTFM from F*** to FANTASTIC!
How does a documentarian work with customer support?
Review support tickets manually
Set up automated notifications
Review difficult cases and solutions with customer support agents
Learn about your customers
Review ticket metrics, and measure how they change as you add more documentation
Have them write!&lt;/p&gt;

awesome documentation, and you’ve earned the job! It’s an exciting new

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been there before. In fact, I’ve done it multiple times. Like
medical triage, you won’t have a lot of time to think before you dive in
and get to work. It’s stressful, even if there are no lives at stake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can be fast and smart. I’ll tell you how to get started (audit
the existing content, create a list of requirements for documentation
tools, ruthlessly prioritize a huge list of tasks) and how to keep going
(build relationships with coworkers in customer-facing roles to learn
what your customers really need from docs, take a moment to pat yourself
on the back every now and then). I’ll also admit to mistakes I’ve made,
and how I’ve learned to avoid them (like trying to do everything myself,
or thinking that time spent planning is taking away from “real work”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your new role will require hard work, but a bit of advice can help you
get started, stay motivated, and avoid pitfalls along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
