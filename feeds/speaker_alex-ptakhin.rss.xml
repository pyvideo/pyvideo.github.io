Itâ€™s always unexpected and we have limited time for decisions. With our hero, we meet real-faced RAM, CPU and IO problems and learn troubleshooting approaches to monolithic and distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try different existing tools from Python and the cloud ecosystem including, but not limited to: cProfile, yappi, memory-profiler and tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be more focused on backend parts and designed for intermediate-level web engineers, but all skill levels are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
