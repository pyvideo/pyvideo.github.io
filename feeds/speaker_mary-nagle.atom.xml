can often be more frustrating than writing the app itself. Learning to
do this well is difficult, especially for those who are new to Python
and might not know where to begin or what questions to ask. While there
is no “right way” to set up a development environment or application,
understanding the components involved and how they interact can empower
you to customize your setup to best suit your needs. This talk will dive
into what happens when setting up a database, the purpose and
configuration of an isolated environment, how Python packages are
installed, and finally, how each of these components interact with each
other and the application itself; in particular, how an application's
structure facilitates said interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
