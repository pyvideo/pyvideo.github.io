are repeat visitors. If we better understand the relationships
between these problems, would it be possible to offer preventive
advice, and thereby reduce cost and provide a better service?
DataKind UK worked with Citizens Advice to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DataKind UK works with charities across the country to help them harness
the power of data science. We recently ran a year-long project with
Citizens Advice. As you probably know, Citizens Advice offers
confidential, impartial advice and support on a number of day-to-day
issues ranging from claiming benefits to faulty goods. DataKind UK
helped the organisation pull together and understand their disparate
data sets to get a better picture of the emerging social problems that
people in the UK face. Here is one small part of that project...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, 5,700 people walk into their local Citizens Advice Bureau
every single day. Of these people, at least 30% are repeat visitors.
They come in seeking advice with one problem, and return months later
with a different problem. If we could better understand the
relationships between these problems, could Citizens Advice offer
preventive advice, and thereby reduce cost and provide a better service?
That's what we sought to find out. Using Python, Scipy, Networkx, Spyre
and D3.js, Billy Wong, a DataKind UK volunteer worked to tackle this
problem. Come to our talk to see the result!&lt;/p&gt;
