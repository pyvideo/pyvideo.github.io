&lt;p&gt;Presented by Clark C. Evans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTSQL is a URI-based high-level query language for relational databases;
it is written in the Python language. HTSQL is a wonderful complement
existing WSGI- based applications, making it trivial to create
interactive dashboards, complex reports. We use HTSQL as a REST query
interface for data integration and ad-hoc reporting by technical users
or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;accidental programmers&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

it is written in the Python language. HTSQL is a wonderful complement
existing WSGI- based applications, making it trivial to create
interactive dashboards, complex reports. We use HTSQL as a REST query
interface for data integration and ad-hoc reporting by technical users
or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;accidental programmers&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HTSQL processor is a high-level URI-based query language for
relational databases such as SQLite, PostgreSQL or MySQL. Since it's
written in Python, it is easy to integrate and generates immediate value
as the core of your application's custom reporting engine. HTSQL is like
the Django or SQLAlchemy ORMs in that it generates SQL, but unlike an
ORM in that its design center is completely different -- it was created
for hard core reporting and not object to relational mapping. Hence, it
is a wonderful complement to existing WSGI- based applications to easily
create dashboards, complex reports. We use HTSQL as a REST reporting
interface for data integration and ad-hoc queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will have two parts. In the first part we'll give a brief
overview of the rationale and design of the query language. In the
second part, we'll show how to hook the HTSQL processor into your WSGI
application and how to make custom commands, such as a simple calendar
output from a table containing a date column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will be presented by Clark Evans, HTSQL was developed by Kyrylo
Simonov. The main HTSQL site is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://htsql.org"&gt;http://htsql.org&lt;/a&gt; and the code is at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org/promet%20heus/htsql"&gt;http://bitbucket.org/prometheus/htsql&lt;/a&gt;.
It'll be similar to previous talks, such as
