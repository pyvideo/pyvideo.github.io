&lt;p&gt;Grocker is a Docker build chain for Python. It transforms your Python
package into a self-contained Docker image which can be easily
deployed in a Docker infrastructure. Grocker also adds a Docker entry
point to easily start your application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Polyconseil, we build Paris electric car sharing service: Autolib'.
This system is based on many services developed using web
technologies, Django and our own libraries to handle business logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packaging is already a difficult problem, deploying large Python
projects is even more difficult. When deploying on a live and user-
centric system like Autolib', you cannot rely on Pip and external PyPI
servers which might become unavailable and are beyond your control. In
the beginning we used classic Debian packaging: it was a maintenance
hell. It took hours to build our packages and update their metadata to
match our Python packages. So we switched to Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker allows us to have a unique item that is deployed in production
systems: code updates are now atomic and deterministic! But before
deploying the Docker image, you need to build it. That's where Grocker
comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grocker is a Docker build chain for Python. It will transform your
Python package into a self-contained Docker image which can be easily
deployed in a Docker Infrastructure. Grocker also adds a Docker entry
point to easily start your application.&lt;/p&gt;
