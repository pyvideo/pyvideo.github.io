It seems like nowadays
it can take weeks to start a project -- creating a signup form, a login
form, a password recovery screen, and all the validation in between. And
you haven't even started on security considerations yet. During this
presentation, the attendees will be introduced to OpenID Connect and
OAuth. They will also learn how to leverage these technologies to create
more secure applications. Most importantly, they will learn how to
delegate authorization and authentication so they can focus on their
real work and forget about all that security stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides this talk Joel is planning a workshop on building a passwordless
authentication server.&lt;/p&gt;
