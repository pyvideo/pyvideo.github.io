&lt;p&gt;[The Auditorium on 2022-07-14]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signing up is on a first-come-first-served basis. The queue is reset every day in the morning.
You may talk about / present (almost) everything with certain boundaries:
- no promotion for products of companies, no call for 'we are hiring' (but you may name your employer).
- conference announcements are limited to one minute only
- one LT per person per conference policy: everyone who has not given an LT at this year's conference, yet, is ahead of you in the queue
- keep it short, the shorter the presentations, the more people can give a talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
