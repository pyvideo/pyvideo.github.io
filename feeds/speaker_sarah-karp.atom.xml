content channels and product suite, creating a disjointed brand
experience. Today, our Information Experience writers now own the
Atlassian voice and tone, and are teaching everyone from developers,
product managers, designers, and marketers how to voicify their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Sarah Karp (Information Experience Team Lead) will answer
the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the Atlassian voice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is a consistent voice important?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you apply voice and tone to a piece of UI copy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, Sarah will share ways in which the Information Experience
writers have applied voicify guidelines across the entire organization.
She'll also share a couple of lessons on voice and tone gone wrong and
how to learn from those mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the talk, you'll come away with an understanding of why
successful products have a distinctive voice and tone. You'll also come
away with great examples of voice and tone wins (and fails), and
practical tips about how to create voicify guidelines for writers and
non-writers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
