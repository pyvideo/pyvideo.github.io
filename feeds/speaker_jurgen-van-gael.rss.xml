hierarchical text classification. I will describe the logical setup of
the various steps involved: data processing, feature selection,
training, validation and labelling. To make this all work in practice
we've mapped the setup onto a Hadoop cluster. I'll discuss some of the
pro's and con's that we've run into when working with Python and Hadoop.
Finally, I'll discuss how we use crowdsourcing to continuously improve
the quality of our hierarchical classifier.&lt;/p&gt;
