The Portable Document Format was
not designed for tabular data. Sadly, a lot of open data is shared as
PDFs and getting tables out for analysis is a pain. A simple
copy-and-paste from a PDF into a text file or spreadsheet program
doesn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will briefly touch upon the history of the Portable Document
Format, discuss some problems that arise when extracting tabular data
from PDFs using the current ecosystem of libraries and tools and
demonstrate how Camelot and Excalibur solve this problem better and in a
scalable manner. These easy-to-use packages automatically detect and
extract tables from PDFs and give you access to the extracted tables in
pandas DataFrames. You can also download them as CSVs or Excel files.&lt;/p&gt;
