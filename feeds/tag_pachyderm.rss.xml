Yet, in order to have real value within a company, data scientists must be able to get their models off of their laptops and deployed within a companyâ€™s data pipelines and infrastructure.  Those models must also scale to production size data. In this talk, we will implement a model locally in Python. We will then take that model and deploy both it's training and inference in a scalable manner to a production cluster with Pachyderm, an open source framework for distributed pipelining and data versioning. We will also learn how to update the production model online, track changes in our model and data, and explore our results.&lt;/p&gt;
