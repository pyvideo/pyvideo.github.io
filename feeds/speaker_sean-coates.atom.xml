&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you'll get a brief introduction to how to use Zappa with your existing or upcoming projects, from how to install it to how to use it. If there's a stable connection, we'll even deploy a simple app during the talk, in only a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lambda is an inexpensive and very highly concurrent way to run &amp;quot;serverless&amp;quot; applications. I'm currently using this technology to deploy an application that has a concurrency of 10,000, for one of the largest companies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
