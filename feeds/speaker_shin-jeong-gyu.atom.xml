Python can be easily installed through the official website, and there are many cases where it is pre-installed depending on the operating system. However, installing libraries for data science along with the widely used notebook environment is a bit more complicated. I will introduce the process of creating a notebook app that runs on a browser engine to teach Python to children. In this presentation, I will look at Python implementations based on WebAssembly and web-based interfaces that have shown various application possibilities in the past two years. I will introduce the process of building Pyodide, a WASM-based Python environment, together with JupyterLite, a complete notebook environment, to enable simple practice of Python in a notebook environment. I will also introduce the process of developing an implementation that uses the Python environment of the local PC as a kernel environment in JupyterLite. I will demo the process of packaging the notebook environment created in this way as a desktop app and testing the results in various ways. I will also share the results of creating a notebook app that bundles various examples along with benchmark results and having children use it. Finally, I'd like to share my personal views on browser-based Python, which has recently become famous through pyscript, and the interesting development environments that could be possible when combined with JavaScript containers.&lt;/p&gt;
