This talk will show how Pandas maintainers and Two Sigma are using Numba to pay off some of this debt in one of the gnarliest parts of the code: window operations. If merged to mainstream Pandas, this work will deduplicate code, make it easier to debug and make window operations extensible.&lt;/p&gt;
