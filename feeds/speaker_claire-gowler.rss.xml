&lt;p&gt;Between 1 and 5 percent of the UK population identifies as having a
non-binary gender or are transgender. This talk aims to help developers
ask users about their gender in a useful and sensitive manner; educate
on what non-binary means and what other issues non-binary and gender
variant users may face when using the web.&lt;/p&gt;
