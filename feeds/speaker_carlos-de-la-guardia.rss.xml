Here we describe Dallinger, a software-based tool that automates large-scale experiments on cultural transmission through crowdsourcing. The tool handles the full experimental pipeline from participant recruitment through data management, enabling experiments that are efficient, reproducible, and unprecedented in their complexity and scale.&lt;/p&gt;

philosophy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented by Carlos de la Guardia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BFG is a Python web application framework based on WSGI. It is a &amp;quot;pay
only for what you eat&amp;quot; framework. Meaning that you can get started
easily and learn new concepts as you go, and only if you need them. It's
simple, well tested, well documented, and fast. It also tries to make
development fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce the framework and its philosophy, including
similarities and differences with other frameworks. I will then show
some of the software available in its repository and discuss the
inclusive, loose connection approach that the BFG community prefers for
creating a flexible web development platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Carlos de la Guardia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The #pylons IRC channel is the most common way of giving support to
users of the Pyramid framework. In this talk we take away some of the
most often discussed topics in the channel and give detailed answers to
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every development project has a few questions and doubts that seem to
come up on its support channels every now and then. The Pyramid
framework is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we introduce Pyramid related FAQs using the chat logs and
proceed to discuss them in detail. Showing the logs allows us to give
the talk a lighter side and makes for an introduction to each topic
based on real user questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered here include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object traversal versus URL dispatch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context and views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication and authorization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much 'Zope stuff' is there in Pyramid and can we take it away?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples of how Pyramid enables the Pylons philosophy of integrating
best of breed or preferred components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The future of Pyramid and Pylons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

projects and multiple developers it pays to establish a few ground rules
and follow some conventions. In this talk we'll discuss some patterns
for organizing and developing a large Pyramid application.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a
&amp;quot;pay only for what you eat&amp;quot; framework. You can get started easily and
learn new concepts as you go, and only if you need them. It's simple,
well tested, well documented, and fast. This course will present Pyramid
and lead you through the creation of a an application as the concepts
from the framework are introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

web applications. Even though it's minimalist in its goals, it provides
strong features to let developers deal with these fundamentals. In this
talk, we'll look at 5 specific Pyramid features that offer web
developers unique flexibility and power.&lt;/p&gt;
