unfamiliar with the ecosystem, can be daunting. Building a cohesive
strategy with widely-available tooling shortens the time-to-productivity
for new contributors to projects internal and open-source, demonstrating
that the maintainers care about onboarding and the developer experience.
I'll give an introduction to how my team solved this problem using a
46-year-old program and push the audience in a direction toward better
developer experiences starting at the greatest common denominator of
tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
