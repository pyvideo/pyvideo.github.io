As someone who works with missing data quite a lot, I was particularly confused and somewhat dismayed by its &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; treatment of NaNs (&amp;quot;null values&amp;quot;). Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sum of a series of NaNs was now 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the product of a series of NaNs was now 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the previous version, these values were NaN, which I thought was the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; way to do things. After all, how can the sum (or product) of nothing turn into something? I went on a journey (or maybe the proper term is &amp;quot;rabbit hole&amp;quot; to explore this question, going through historical GitHub issues logs, pandas-dev mailing list messages, even contacting a core pandas developer and looking up how other programming languages like R handled the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that really, it all just comes down to math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll make the case that while the current behavior is &lt;em&gt;mathematically&lt;/em&gt; consistent, it is often counterintuitive. Because who says math is supposed to make sense at first glance?&lt;/p&gt;
