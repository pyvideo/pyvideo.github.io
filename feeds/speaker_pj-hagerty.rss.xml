So why do developers think the language they use defines the problems they solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will take a look at misconceptions across the board, some experiences, both positive and negative, people have had crossing barriers to new languages, and show some of the benefits thinking of one's self as a coder and not a &amp;quot;Ruby coder&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;Python dev&amp;quot; can have on being a better problem solver.&lt;/p&gt;

Is it possible to streamline workflow by adjusting how we listen to music and what music we listen to? Studies have shown that exposure to certain kinds of music can help to develop cognitive strength and improve performance of tasks. This talk will explore those studies and show what sort of things can be done to improve the listeners environment and help people to create better code.&lt;/p&gt;
