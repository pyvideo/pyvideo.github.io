&lt;p&gt;Presented by Deniz Kural&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advances in genome sequencing has enabled large-scale projects such as
the 1000 Genomes Project to sequence genomes across diverse populations
around the world, resulting in very large data sets. I use Python for
rapid development of algorithms for processing &amp;amp; analyzing genomes and
discovering thousands of new variants, including &amp;quot;Mobile Elements&amp;quot; that
copy&amp;amp;paste; themselves across the genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing now enables accurate
sequencing human genomes at a low cost &amp;amp; high speed. This technology is
now used to initiate projects involving large-scale sequencing of many
genomes. The 1000 Genomes project aims to sequence 2500 genomes across
27 world populations, and has initially completed its Pilot phase. The
aim of the project is to discover &amp;amp; characterize novel variants. These
variants enable association studies that investigate the link between
genomic variation &amp;amp; phenotypes, including disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A class of variants, known as &amp;quot;Structural Variants&amp;quot; represent a
heterogenous class of larger variants, such as inversions, duplications,
deletions, and various kinds of insertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Python to for rapid development of algorithms to process, analyze,
and annotate very large data sets. In particular, I focus on Mobile
Elements, pieces of DNA that copy&amp;amp;paste; across the genome. These
elements constitute roughly half of the genome, whereas protein-coding
genes account for roughly 1.5 % of the genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will discuss distributed computing, genomics, and big data within the
context of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
