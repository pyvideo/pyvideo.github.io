Stop taking ML as a threat and learn it today as not learning it is a HUGE LOSS! Get started today with ML in Aaron's remarkable 45-mins talk. We will begin by talking about the paradigm of ML, then taking a deep dive into Neural Networks and building a Neural Network from scratch with Keras and TensorFlow (the hottest machine learning framework). You'll master the magic of neural networks that are powering incredible advances both in AI, self-driving cars, and much more! Finally, we will finish off by talking about Reinforcement learning and how it is empowering YouTube suggestions along with tips-and-tricks from a specialist plus a grand finale mind-blowing demo. Ready to master the paradigm of ML? Let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;

though are not enough engineers to fulfill that demand. In this talk, we'll
learn the core concepts of ML, then a deep dive into the fascinating world
of neural networks. By the end of this talk, you'll learn the tools you need so you
can be one of the highly specialized ML practitioners that FAANG companies
are looking for. Ready to explore the magical world of ML and master it
WITHOUT a Ph.D.? Let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;
