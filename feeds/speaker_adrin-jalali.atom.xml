&lt;p&gt;[Wicklow Hall 1 on 2022-07-15]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many aspects of open sourcing a product which are often overlooked yet greatly impact the community and activities around the project. One of the first things people think about is the licence [1], which is very important, but what people don’t often think about is the governance of it, which impacts the speed, decision making processes, and the kind of engagement one can get from contributors to the project who don’t work in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every project is open sourced for the same purpose. On one side of the “openness” spectrum some projects are out there to give a bit of visibility to what a team is doing or to showcase a research or another product, and on the other spectrum the creators of a project put it out there to create a user and contributing community so that eventually the community would be active enough for the original creators to become a minority in the contributing and governance team. Depending on what the goals are, one needs to create or use a governance model which matches those goals and needs. One can look at the following categories from this perspective [2]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Do-ocracy&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Founder-leader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-appointing council or board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electoral&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate-backed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foundation-backed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we talk about some practices which can fend people off when they try to join a community, giving concrete detailed examples on how it can look like while interacting with contributors and users online, such as [3]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of onboarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing in writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership is a mystery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No path to success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of transparency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not seeing ourselves in others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different ways to have generated methods and attributes attached to all classes in a library, and this talk presents the way we’re doing it in scikit-learn. Here you’ll understand the use-case, and see the details and challenges presented by it, and how we approached them.&lt;/p&gt;

In this tutorial we use PipelineIO, to deploy a cluster on the cloud, which gives us a JupyterHub to develop our method, and uses PMML to persist and deploy and serve the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you have a machine learning module in your pipeline, persisting and serving the model is not yet a trivial task. This tutorial shows how an open source framework using several open source technologies could potentially solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey started with this[1] question on StackOverflow. I wanted to be able to do my usual data science stuff, mostly in python, and then deploy them somewhere serving like a REST API, responding to requests in real-time, using the output of the trained models. My original line of thought was this workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;train the model in python or pyspark or in scala in apache spark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get the model, put it in an apache flink stream and serve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the point at which I had been reading and watching tutorials and attending meetups related to these technologies. I was looking for a solution which is better than:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;train models in python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write a web-service using flask, put it behind a apache2 server, and put a bunch of them behind a load balancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just sounded wrong, or at its best, not scalable. After a bit of research, I came across PipelineIO[2,3] which seems to promise exactly what I'm looking for. In this tutorial we use PipelineIO, to deply a cluster on the cloud, which gives us a JupyterHub to develop our method, and uses PMML to persist and deploy and serve the model. My own jurney and take from PipelineIO are documented github[4]. I'll use Amazon AWS, but PipelineIO uses Kubernetes and you can easily deploy in any environment in which you can use Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work in an environment in which you have different machine learning modules, which should be used in production in real time and as a part of a stream processing pipeline, this talk is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
