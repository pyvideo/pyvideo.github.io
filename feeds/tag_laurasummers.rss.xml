How do we move past the AI Ethics hype and start trying, testing and implementing practical approaches? In this talk the presenter will share stories, discoveries, and pointers from their time as an ‘ethics ops’ consultant embedded with a small fraud detection team in a big telco. From improving the science bit of data science, to developing the collective sensitivity of the team, to designing recourse for false positives, tune in for pragmatic pointers and actionable take-aways.&lt;/p&gt;
