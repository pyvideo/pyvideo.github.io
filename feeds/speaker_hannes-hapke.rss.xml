Four years ago I thought python was a snake, Django a gypsy musician and Celery was to be eaten with tzatziki. Today I have a geographically-enabled Django webapp in production. I will very briefly introduce the essential ecosystem of Django packages (South, Celery or GeoDjango) which are necessary to get started. However, the focus of the talk is on ways a noob can learn Django, interact with the community and quickly turn their ideas into real web apps. Python/Django is one of the best documented programming languages; but it takes some time to learn how to navigate docs, blogs, apps, snippets and user groups. I'll show newbies how to quickly accelerate in Django.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have developed your first web app and you noticed that some requests take too much time for a good user experience? Celery is an option to provide a better user experience by &amp;quot;outsourcing&amp;quot; long running tasks from the initial web request.&lt;/p&gt;
