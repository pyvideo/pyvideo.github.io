breaking changes in its API can be daunting. To minimize disruptions for
users, projects are incentivized to plan these transitions carefully,
which may include &lt;em&gt;API deprecations&lt;/em&gt;, where messages warning users of
upcoming changes are added to the affected APIs while they’re still
functional. However, this imposes extra workload for the project’s
maintainers, as both old and new versions of the API must be kept
functional throughout the transition period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a maintainer of a software project undergoing preparations for a
major version release, I recently found myself in a similar situation:
our goal was to provide backward compatibility with the previous version
for as long as possible, without impacting the development of new
features. Practically, this included dealing with a radical
restructuring of the Python codebase, resulting in hundreds of modules
being relocated, split, or removed. Was there any way to ensure that the
deprecated import paths could still be used without errors, without
having to maintain two separate versions of the package?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the answer to “can you do that in Python?” is more often
than not “yes!”; for this particular case, the path to success turned
out to be through the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;importlib&lt;/tt&gt; package of the standard library. For
something so close to Python’s internals, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;importlib&lt;/tt&gt; is both
accessible and extensible, allowing ordinary code to customize almost
completely how and what modules can be imported---including modules that
are not there anymore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This intermediate-level talk will present a complete solution based on
Python’s importlib machinery that allows to redirect modules or module
attributes with deprecations in a simple, robust, and scalable way.
While the context of the solution is especially relevant for project
maintainers, the focus is on importlib techniques that are generally
applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
