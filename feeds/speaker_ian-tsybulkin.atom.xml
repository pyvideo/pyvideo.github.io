being, make decisions effectively, take actions optimally, and more
over, can learn from its own experience were always be a goal for
scientists. This presentation describes how everybody can create a
software agent capable to learn from its own actions and adopt its
behavior by using reinforcement learning approach. A few examples of
self-learning agents will be shown and discussed during presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
