What is the multi-agent system? And how can you use the power of AI agents in your day-to-day data science workflow? In this hands-on tutorial, I will introduce AI agents and demonstrate how to design, build, and manage a multi-agent system for your data science workflows. Participants will learn how to break down complex tasks, assign AI agents to collaborate effectively, and ensure accuracy and reliability in their outputs. We will also discuss the trade-offs, limitations, and best practices for incorporating AI agents into data science projects.&lt;/p&gt;
