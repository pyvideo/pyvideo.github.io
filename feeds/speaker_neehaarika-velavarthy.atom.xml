least a few hundred years now. Being folk music, most of these tunes have
been passed down the generations by ear causing many variations of the same
tune to co-exist. Even today, as the tunes travel geographically, &lt;strong&gt;they
develop slight variations&lt;/strong&gt; according to the players' individual quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over recent times, websites like [thesession.org](&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thesession.org/"&gt;https://thesession.org/&lt;/a&gt;)
are beginning to collect well-known tunes in databases made up of player
contributions. This particular website features both the &lt;em&gt;abc&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;midi&lt;/em&gt;
formats in addition to the staff notation. Players are allowed to contribute
their own versions of popular tunes which makes this site very conducive to
observing &lt;strong&gt;patterns in the variations&lt;/strong&gt;. This analysis will explore &lt;strong&gt;how
these tunes changes across their newer versions and what makes some tunes
change more than the others&lt;/strong&gt;. It will define metrics by which tune
variations can be quantified and visualized and it will try to unearth
common patterns in these variations.&lt;/p&gt;
