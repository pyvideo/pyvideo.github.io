extract all of the lyrics of the inspiring and influential Taylor
Swift from the Internet. Using a light-hearted approach and practical
Python examples, we aim to teach people the basics of using Celery for
data extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celery is an open source, Python-based, asynchronous task framework
which is well-suited for extracting data from webpages, APIs, and text
files. With its power comes a bit of a learning curve. This talk
covers some of the first questions a new Celery user might have. It
will also point out some common pitfalls for beginning users.&lt;/p&gt;
