&lt;p&gt;Data security makes news headlines, often for the wrong reasons, when it has not been implemented correctly, or when it has been added to systems as an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data security makes news headlines, often for the wrong reasons, when it has not been implemented correctly, or when it has been added to systems as an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plone is a secure, open source web content management system that is written in Python and has been under active development since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Plone's great strengths is its baked-in security model, which is comprised of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;object- and field-level permissions
roles
groups
workflow states, transitions, and guards
In this talk, I will explain the elements of Plone's time-tested security model and I will show how these elements work together to help developers create websites and web applications that are secure by default.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether at work or outside of work, we usually need to collaborate with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collaboration can take many forms:
- storing documents
- organizing documents
- sharing documents
- creating and filling out forms
- protecting documents and data from prying eyes
- managing access to documents and data
- finding documents and data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprises enable this kind of collaboration by creating an intranet. Users must log into this intranet, quickly and easily find the documents and data they need, revise them, save them, and share them out to others on their project teams. Intranet administrators create teams and set aside workspaces for those teams.
Setting up this type of intranet does NOT have to be hard nor does it have to be expensive!
Plone is a longstanding, secure, open source web content management system that lets you create intranets like this.&lt;/p&gt;

Google’s AutoML Vision service is a great new tool. A client of ours had a time intensive process for classifying and routing documents. Using AutoML and Python, we helped them prototype and deploy a machine learning model to reduce the frequency of errors and accelerate overall processing of thousands of documents a day. We will describe the solution and present lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;
