I will give a brief history of Python and parallel computing, take a look at Python’s ‘infamous’ GIL, and share how and why Pythonistas can get started with using GPUs to do more work faster.&lt;/p&gt;

The internet is littered with poor security practices and password breaches, but the world is not ready to go password free yet. So what can we do to protect our users?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at how we currently protect passwords, at what we can throw away from those processes and what we can bring in to help strengthen our users' passwords. We'll investigate the tools, practices and APIs that can help us in this endeavour. Together we can move the world from &amp;quot;password1&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;correct horse battery staple&amp;quot; and beyond!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Add this one line of code to your website to avoid being sued!'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think that that statement sounds like a particularly obnoxious ad, or that it must be too good to be true, you're not alone.  However, over the past several years, a number of companies popped up with products which claimed to do just that.  Their solutions were marketed as a quick and easy way to satisfy legislative requirements, and best of all, ensure that your website would be accessible to anyone, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the lawsuits started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the world of accessibility overlays. According to their creators, they're plug-and-play software which remediates accessibility issues on your website, bringing you into compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and disability access laws instantly.  However, if you ask the disabled people who should be reaping the benefits, the answer seems paradoxical: accessibility overlays actually make websites &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; usable for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that?  And how did we get to a point where the most prominently advertised solutions for software accessibility make the problem worse?  Let's examine this cautionary tale, and find out what it can teach us about both accessibility and the principles of good design.&lt;/p&gt;

It is easy to lose hope when the list of things to do keeps growing, the incidents keep coming and gray hair begins to show up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t lose hope yet! In this talk, we will discuss how a bit of strategy and creativity can go a long way in helping you secure your organisation...on a budget!&lt;/p&gt;

With some clever thinking our multidisciplinary teaching team turned this crisis to our advantage and achieved an all time high level of student satisfaction. We are now able to reach any student, no matter their location, timezone or computing device with a real-time collaborative coding environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover what we consider “must-haves” for teaching in these extreme circumstances and how we have been able to maintain student engagement. We will demonstrate our solution to hosting tutorials online and share the lessons we learnt along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

But the data for it all is scattered in the wind, stuck in excel files of massive organisations, in tiny addendums to research papers, and even in government tweets. Roll up your sleeves, we'll dive into efforts at Our World in Data to collect, organise and republish this data for great good!&lt;/p&gt;

How do we move past the AI Ethics hype and start trying, testing and implementing practical approaches? In this talk the presenter will share stories, discoveries, and pointers from their time as an ‘ethics ops’ consultant embedded with a small fraud detection team in a big telco. From improving the science bit of data science, to developing the collective sensitivity of the team, to designing recourse for false positives, tune in for pragmatic pointers and actionable take-aways.&lt;/p&gt;

Data is everywhere and it is super beneficial to leverage these data and build models for making sense out of them and telling stories. The field of sports, especially football (soccer), is enriched by data analysis that makes us understand the game better and predict outcomes. Many people want to delve deep into football (soccer) data analysis and get their hands dirty. This talk is to help them do so by pedagogically introducing them to the introductory analytical methodologies to overcome the initial barriers of the field and start working with data analyses and visualizations on football data to deduce interesting results.&lt;/p&gt;

I was interested to hear more but skeptical that it could lure me away from the micro:bit lifestyle where I’d invested my time learning and developing content. But here I am, 6 months into my Kookaberry journey, and I’m a total convert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll take you through my journey of discovery and show you how Kookaberry gives you an easier entry point to MicroPython and embedded systems for beginners, more extendable, realistic, and relatable project experiences for your existing programmers (without having to get the breadboards out!), and how you can utilise Kookaberry in a huge range of cross-curricular applications.&lt;/p&gt;

While these might seem to require special platforms and specialized expertise, in fact there's so much that can be done with graph-based technologies in Python. A team of open source developers has been working on [&lt;cite&gt;kglab&lt;/cite&gt;](&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/DerwenAI/kglab"&gt;https://github.com/DerwenAI/kglab&lt;/a&gt;) to integrate many different libraries related to graph work into an abstraction that plays well with popular data science tools in Python: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Parquet, spaCy, PyTorch, RAPIDS, etc. This session will introduce Graph Data Science, showing how you can leverage these techniques into your data analytics work.&lt;/p&gt;

What exactly are these? How do they come along together? Do I even need to know about them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing back-ends for dynamic websites can be done in a lot of different ways, and fortunately, python has a great set of libraries and packages to help us with the implementation. The problem arises when we dive deep and are overwhelmed with the stuff we have at our disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk, we'll try to find answers to the above questions. We'll take a look at the high-level and core features of different parts and understand how they are kept compatible with each other to bring out a fantastic web ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

For example how can one best overcome the classic trade-off between quality and cost of production, when the monetary value of quality is not defined? In this gentle introduction to multi-objective optimisation you will learn about Pareto Fronts and how they can be used to optimise for multiple objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a data driven decision maker you will learn the advantages and shortcomings of the technique and be able to assess applicability for your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk examines how to count distinct items from a firehose of data, how to determine if we've seen a given item before, and why absolute accuracy may be impractical when doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probabilistic data structures trade accuracy for approximate results, speed and economy of resources. They provide fast, scalable solutions to problems such as counting likes on social media posts, or determining which articles on a website a user has previously read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll introduce the Hyperloglog and Bloom Filter, explain how they work at a high level, and demonstrate different ways in which each can be leveraged in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

You might say it's a function that accepts a function and returns a function. That's wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's the right answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us for a deep (but standard talk-length) dive into decorators!  You’ll learn what decorators actually are, how they work, how to write your own decorators, and how decorators enable you to do extremely weird things in Python. Most importantly, you’ll understand how to use decorators responsibly, and definitely not to confuse your friends and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

But you can prepare for it in a controlled environment using Chaos Engineering techniques. In this talk, you will learn to make use of chaos engineering practices to plan and assess your production readiness. This means that you are more ready for the failure scenarios, when, not if, they happen.&lt;/p&gt;

It was originally part of a workshop I delivered for new tutors in my University CS programs, with tips to help students learn programming more effectively both in one-on-one and group environments. It spans topics from psychology, to lesson design and to communication skills, and in the small and the large will help you communicate topics better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like vampires, Javascript cannot generally enter your web application unless it is invited in. However, there are many sneaky ways that you may find yourself with ‹s›a vampire‹/s› some Javascript inside your app without realising you've technically allowed it to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

It was designed for this single purpose and had never been considered to be needed or expanded beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the next six months, the app was adapted to allow breakfasts, hoodies, socks, pens and rubik's cubes ordered for different events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these new adaptions came added complexities.&lt;/p&gt;
