Be smart</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-italia-2017/dont-try-to-look-smart-be-smart.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology industry is growing and already huge. The number of
humans in this industry and the number of areas they can work on are
overwhelming. The number of opportunities often don’t seem as many for
an industry that big, nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how long you’ve been in this industry, you often feel
overwhelmed, unfocused, demotivated by the size of the industry, the
uncertainty it generates and the urge of doing something others consider
important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this talk, the audience will learn how to grow in an industry
that is often blasted with intellectual appearances, quantity over
quality and unstoppable, constant, changes. The talk provides tips to
cope with large communities and fields as well as experiences and
examples.&lt;/p&gt;

It has since then grown
into a thriving community with code sprint and regular meetings
attracting over 50 attendees. This talk will present history of the
group and will highlight the key factors behind its success with the
hope to inspire others to replicate that accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talk will first walk the audience through the factors inherent to
Montréal itself and how it affected other user groups before
Montréal-Python. These groups inspired us to get a group of Python
hackers started the presentation will show how we were able to leverage
on the success of other user groups to bring our young community
forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various stages of our growth will be presented along with insights
on how we managed to find speakers and venues at each point. The
presentation will then go through an overview of our current activities,
sharing in the process how effective they are in engaging the community.
Our plans for the next few years will be presented then a summary will
provide advice to anyone who would like to get started organizing a
local Python user group.&lt;/p&gt;
