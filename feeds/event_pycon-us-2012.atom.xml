&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indico is an open source content management system developed at the
European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and currently used in
more than 90 scientific institutions world-wide. Indico provides a
multitude of features to conference/meeting organizers, merging the
capabilities of a powerful CMS with a calendaring layer, thus allowing
users to keep track of past and future meetings, and to quickly access
all the resources concerning a particular event. Other very useful
features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference registration &amp;amp; e-payment integration;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paper/abstract reviewing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with chat (XMPP) systems;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with videoconferencing/webcasting applications;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Room booking module;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag&amp;amp;drop; timetable editing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event reminders &amp;amp; alarms (scheduler);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensible via plugin subsystem;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At CERN alone, Indico serves a community of around 10.000 users, with
~15.000 different visitors per day (~1 M hits). It hosts more than
150.000 events, made of around 700.000 individual contributions/talks
and ~900.000 files. It has become part of &amp;quot;CERN speech&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;look it up on
Indico&amp;quot; is almost as obvious as &amp;quot;Google it&amp;quot; around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Indico is as well an indispensable tool in the realm of High Energy
Physics, going far beyond the borders of this organization. Institutions
such as Fermilab, MIT and IHEP (China) are using it for their own
meetings/conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is fully written in Python and JavaScript, using ZODB as its
database back-end. It is a perfect example of how Python-related
technologies can be used to build powerful web applications that empower
scientific research and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

algorithm? Your algorithm could be useful worldwide to people who face a
real- world problem but do not want to write code. Professionals in
industry, scientists in other fields or researchers in developing
countries can quickly apply your work to their domain with a web-based
cloud-computing platform like CrossCompute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CrossCompute is a site where you can run mathematical models and
algorithms submitted by researchers. If you are a researcher and you
submit your algorithm, you'll get paid each time it runs. We'll send you
a URL where users can run your model on their data as many times as they
want. More users mean more feedback that you can use to improve your
model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example: Suppose a mathematician in the US develops an
operations research model for placing schools in a community given the
locations of existing schools and households, and decides to charge ten
cents each time it runs. Then a business owner in Ghana runs the model
over the internet to place stores in his district, and saves money
because he didn't have to hire a consulting firm or buy a software
package. Meanwhile, the mathematician in the US uses the algorithm
revenue to fund research to improve the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is an exciting time to get involved in data analytics for your city
or local government. Governments need to prioritize limited resources
like emergency response firefighters, police officers and city
inspectors. I urge you to contact your local Mayor's office to learn
about the challenges they are facing. Then, create a tool to make their
life easier. You can send the tool to &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&amp;#64;crosscompute.com"&gt;support&amp;#64;crosscompute.com&lt;/a&gt; where it
will join a growing collection of analytics for the public good. You
will get the credit for the algorithm, the revenue and users from around
the world.&lt;/p&gt;

hosting project supporting photos, HTML5 video, and more, the road to
federation has been a wild ride so far. We owe a lot to the huge
community of fellow federators whose work on the ostaus library enabled
us to start in the middle with our own not-quite-finished spin, Kuneco.
Kudos to the GNU project for getting excited about the web with us.
We're also thankful for the massive outpouring of project love that
channeled itself through transifex and has made Media Goblin
global-ready even though it isn't finished. Ever thought about switching
databases midstream? Come talk to us, Mongo to SQL wasn't as bad as we'd
been expecting. We'll also tell you all about our minimalist wsgi
un-framework design and how we think it's working compared to Django or
even Pylons/Pyramid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's still left do? Smoother interoperations with allied projects like
StatusNet and Diaspora. Support for more media types like 3D modelling
and presentations. World domination... in a friendly way! Swing by if
you're looking for a new project to get involved with or just want
details to take back to your own.&lt;/p&gt;

know and love. Clearly the Internet has survived even though hardly
anyone has deployed IPv4's successor, IPv6. Drop by to learn about what
IPv6 is, why you should deploy it and some of the hurdles to deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 3rd, 2011 the world ran out of the IPv4 addresses that we
know and love. The Internet continues to work thanks to technologies
like NAT that enable private IP addresses like 192.168.1.1 and 10.0.0.1
to be reused across organizations. However, even these large blocks of
private IP addresses are not large enough for large ISPs like Comcast in
the United States that give several IP addresses to each customer (ex.
cable set top box, voip, cable modem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue adding new customers large ISPs have begun deploying two
technologies: IPv6 and large scale NAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large scale NAT is a way for large ISPs to put several of their
customers behind a single public IP address. This means that the one
public IPv4 address you used to have to yourself is now shared by you
and several of your neighbors. It means that as a website owner it is
now more difficult to discern anything useful from the IP addresses
visiting your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPv6 solves the address exhaustion problem by moving from approximately
4 billion IP addresses to 3.4×10^38 IP addresses; more than the number
of atoms on Earth. With plenty of IP addresses ISPs can now return to
giving out unique, public IP addresses to each customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many mobile operators are already beginning to deploy IPv6. In 2009
Verizon issued a mandate that any LTE devices on its network support
IPv6 with IPv4 support being listed as optional [1]. An IPv6-only device
will still need access to the IPv4 Internet, however, IPv6 and IPv4 are
not compatible. Providers like Verizon are putting in place protocol
translation devices that inspect Internet traffic going through them and
proxy IPv4-only websites to their IPv6 customers. While this may sound
wonderful it means that mobile providers are inspecting and rewriting
your packets. Making things more interesting is that this won't work
securely over SSL. The solution is to enable IPv6 on your website so
that IPv6-only hosts can directly access your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joining the IPv6 bandwagon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon's Elastic Load Balancer supports IPv6 and is already enabled in
all east coast availability zones [2]. If you're already using ELB
enabling IPv6 on your website is as easy as making a single DNS change.
Or so we'd hope, there are still some impediments to a world where your
site runs seamlessly on IPv6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The user with broken IPv6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people in the world with broken or inferior IPv6 connectivity
and a web browser or operating system that attempt to use IPv6 anyway.
What this means is that if you turn on IPv6 on your website you have the
potential to cut off those users from your site. In this talk I'll
discuss methods for measuring and analyzing this loss before your
broadly enable IPv6 so that you can make an informed decision about when
and how to flip the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geo IP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geo IP libraries today are still coming to terms with IPv6. One vendor
in particular is working on IPv6 but only provides limited support in
their free libraries and not yet in their python driver. In their
commercial library, the one generally considered better, they do not
support IPv6 yet due to lack of data [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IPv6 without Amazon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Eventbrite we do development inside of Virtual Box virtual machines.
In this talk I'll discuss how we configure IPv6 on both the host and
guest operating systems so that we can test IPv6 before we push to
Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IP Address Validation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you accept IP addresses from end users check your IP address
validation routines (Django has support, see GenericIPAddressField).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
