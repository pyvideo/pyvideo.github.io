in goal setting. While many of us can come up with things we want to
accomplish, it is the emotional connection we make with the dream by
believing in its possibility that lead us to action and accomplishments.

chance of making the team. Sarah's story is one of guts, courage and
perseverance. Audiences will leave inspired to dream big, overcome
obstacles and of course believe!&lt;/p&gt;
