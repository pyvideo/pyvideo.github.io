and delivering them to the public are an essential part of spreading the
word about what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They need to be as equally consistent with your messaging and style
guides, get to a key point effectively and also allow the presenter to
inject some personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially hard with technical projects where the 'story' is
either hard to explain or can't just end up sounding like a sales pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I will explore and explain my experiences as an
advocate for several open source projects, audience reactions to those
presentations and how I have iterated my presentations in sync with
changes to product and branding.&lt;/p&gt;
