multidisciplinary knowledge of art, psychology, math, computer science,
physics and others, patience, open mind and dedication. Making computer
games with Python is a nightmare. You hit practically every sharp corner
that Python has, starting with installation, through binary libraries,
poor hardware support, up to distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PewPew devices are an attempt at solving the worst problems by giving
you a dedicated, cheap, simple and portable gaming device, that you can
easily program with Python with just a simple text editor. They also
make pretty neat conference badges. I will talk about how they were
conceived, how they are used, and how you can extend and improve them
yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the talk you should have a good idea about what is
CircuitPython and MicroPython and how they can be used to build and
program such simple devices. You should also know where to find the
resources necessary to try designing and building your own.&lt;/p&gt;
