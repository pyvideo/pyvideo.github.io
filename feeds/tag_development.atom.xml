to create a good foundation for an asyncio-based service, including
graceful shutdowns, proper exception handling, and testing asynchronous
code. We’ll get into the hairier topics as well, covering topics like
working with synchronous code, debugging and profiling, and working with
threaded code. We’ll learn how to approach asynchronous and concurrent
programming with Python’s asyncio library, take away some best
practices, and learn what pitfalls to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline:
(40 minutes + 5 min Q&amp;amp;A, if unable to get 45 minutes, then 30 min slot
with no time for Q&amp;amp;A)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="intro-2m"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Intro (2m)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaker/company intro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting the context/purpose of talk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="foundations-9m-trimmed-to-6m-for-30-min-slot"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Foundations (9m - trimmed to 6m for 30 min slot)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial setup of an asyncio service (2m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required boilerplate code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspiration from official asyncio tutorial docs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making a service &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; concurrent (5m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-blocking vs concurrent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when to be concurrent vs serial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using callbacks vs awaits vs scheduling tasks (create_task) vs
asyncio.Events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making synchronous code asyncio-friendly (2m)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="intermediate-9m-trimmed-to-6m-for-30-min-slot"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Intermediate (9m - trimmed to 6m for 30 min slot)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graceful shutdowns (3m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a signal handler is, why it’s needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What signals to listen to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gotchas of cancelling tasks, asyncio.shield + shutdown behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exception handling (3m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between top-level exception handling and handling
within other coroutines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid mistakenly swallowing/missing raised exceptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making use of loop.set_exception_handler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making threaded code asyncio-“friendly” (3m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling threaded code from coroutines (aka running within a
ThreadPoolExecutor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling coroutines from from threaded code (aka
run_coroutine_threadsafe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="advanced-19m-trimmed-to-15m-for-30-min-slot"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Advanced (19m - trimmed to 15m for 30 min slot)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing asyncio code (7m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefits of debug mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to mock coroutines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging an asyncio service (5m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinforce debug mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using “tricks&amp;quot; like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;asyncio.all_tasks&lt;/tt&gt; with logging,
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;loop.slow_callback_duration&lt;/tt&gt;, adding context/stack trace in default
exception handler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profiling (7m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic profiling (cProfile, strace) - not that different from sync
code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous profiling with 3rd party tools, i.e. github.com/what-
studio/profiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyCharm’s asyncio &amp;amp; thread profiler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to properly trace a workflow/request (e.g. for the purpose of
distributed tracing) (to be cut if not enough time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Code review is not just boring duty. It's mutual responsibility for
the software we're releasing. It's one of the most critical aspects of
code quality, and therefore it's the first step of quality assurance.
This is also the key to easier programming and better maintainability.
Clean code is much easier to debug, and it's much harder to introduce
a bug in such code.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When you think about code review, you probably think about verifying
and examining the code. Reviewing the expert's code may look like a
waste of time because he knows what he's doing. Reviewing the code by
a beginner may look like a waste of time because he's not able to find
as many defects as an experienced developer. Code review is a code
quality tool in the first place, but it's also much beyond that. You
can teach or help someone, learn from somebody and much more both from
the position of reviewer and reviewee.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;There is much more about the real power of code review which I want to
share with you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk is also about how to do it the right way and how to not do
it based on lessons learned and my experience within the diverse teams
of people with a variety of knowledge and experience. I was reviewing
the code but, on the other hand, I was also being reviewed. I'd like
to pass my observations to people who are reviewing the code both in
commercial and open source projects for a while. This talk is also for
those who want to start to review the code, but they do not know how
to do it.&lt;/div&gt;

several ways. Delta Chat is a Whatsapp/Telegram-style messenger app
which uses the existing e-mail server network instead of central
servers. There is no address book upload, and no necessity to tie
accounts to mobile numbers. We'll live- demo how &amp;quot;Chat over E-mail&amp;quot;
works, with random audience members, in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll then look into how Python is used for automated testing (with
pytest) against the messenger core library which is exposed through
CFFI. However, the core library will soon be ported to full Rust. Are
there better ways to interface Rust with Python than going through
C-interfaces?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third part we'll introduce first example Chat Bots, written in
Python. Do you want to send an machine-generated system allert to a
sysadmin group? Or safely archive all media that is posted to a family
group? Or have your IoT sensor react to commands or send info? Just do
it without registering a bot to some central cite, or by exposing all
content information to (e. g. Telegram) servers. A Chat Bot only needs
access to a standard IMAP/SMTP account. We'll look at the simple Python
API for writing and testing powerful and versatile Chat bots.&lt;/p&gt;

response framework focused on remote live forensics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It consists of a Python client (agent) that is installed on target
systems, and Python server infrastructure that can manage and talk to
clients. The goal of GRR is to support forensics and investigations in a
fast, scalable manner to allow analysts to quickly triage attacks and
perform analysis remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRR was started at Google in 2009 as a simple Python helper script used
by Incident Response engineers. Eventually a little Python script got a
little server component, was adapted to run on multiple systems (Mac,
Linux, Windows), then a little UI was added and a few nice features were
introduced (large-scale hunts, collection of predefined artifacts,
memory analysis). A helper script has eventually evolved into a
sophisticated framework with 180,000 lines of Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;In the presentation we’ll talk about the process of evolving a small
prototype-like Python project into a production-ready system, using
GRR as an example. The topics that we’ll cover are:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Taking shortcuts - both in terms of design and implementation.
Reasons for taking them and their eventual costs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Relying on Python’s power features (i.e. meta-classes, mixins)?
Long-term consequences on maintainability and readability.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Organising the project into separate PyPI packages - benefits of
doing that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Continuous integration, testing and automated builds for various
platforms - implementation costs and maintainability effects.&lt;/div&gt;

why Python is stated to come with &amp;quot;batteries included&amp;quot;. In such an
amount of features and tools it's easy to get lost and miss some of the
less unknown modules or gems hidden within the whole load of functions
and classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk aims at showcasing some recipes, snippets and usages of
standard library modules and functions that are less known or that are
not covered in the most common books and tutorials available for Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;We will see how frequently for tasks where you used third party
libraries or frameworks a solution bultin into the standard library is
already available, and such solution is guaranteed to be maintained
and well working for the years to come thanks to the standard library
reliability and stability.&lt;/div&gt;

teams, but it's a hard task to implement it and adapt based on
different teams. Setting up all necessary Agile meetings and using
buzz words is not enough for the team to be happy and successful while
working in Agile environment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Inspired by the &amp;quot;Divine Comedy&amp;quot; by Dante Alighieri, I decided to
create a short guide into Agile best practices. It will guide through
Failures, Challenges to the Success in building a happy dream team!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk is divided into three parts:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1. Failures in setting up Agile processes for a team.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2. Challenges on the way to happy and successful team.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Sunday afternoon I foolishly asked myself, &amp;quot;How hard can it be to
write a simple code editor?&amp;quot; Several years later an international team
of volunteers are still working on the project. We have had to address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross platform GUI development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross platform packaging solutions for Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating an interactive visual debugger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating with iPython notebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating with various IoT MicroPython devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating with frameworks such as PyGame/PyGameZero and Flask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating cross platform testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researching and testing UX with a challenging user base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility for all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internationalisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating an inclusive, welcoming and supportive community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain why Mu was created, how Mu was created and, most

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Did you know there are multiple ways to raise and capture exceptions?
Have you ever wondered if you should raise a built-in exception or
create your own hierarchy? Did you ever find it hard to understand
what an exception meant?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk will go through the decisions needed to raise and capture
exceptions when creating a library. We will look at how to translate
and handle errors, create your own exceptions, and make exceptions
clear and easy to troubleshoot, while also understanding how they
actually work, common pitfalls.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will enable intermediate developers to leave the room with a
solid understanding of how to work effectively with exceptions. As the
exception flow usually goes untested, this will help prevent frustrating
situations when errors occur that are not easy to understand or when an
unexpected result is produced. The talk will delve into the different
ways of working with exceptions. We will illustrate this with a
real-world example to which many developers will be able to relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the talk, intermediate developers will leave the room more
informed and better prepared to create and handle exceptions, having
learned about many utilities that were already available to them, but
were never used or were used improperly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The not-so-advanced Pythonistas will get an in-depth dive into
exceptions. Even if they might not be able to grasp all of the content,
they will get a sense of the features that most programmers are unaware
of and learn to use them when the proper situation arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced programmers will find this to be a humorous talk that will
certainly teach them at least one new thing, as I will dive into parts
of the grammar of Python that even many advanced programmers are not
used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The talk is also full of niche information like why the variable that
catches exceptions doesn’t like outside of the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;except&lt;/tt&gt; scope.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The talk is comprised of four main sections preceded by an
introduction to the problem and a conclusion with time for questions
at the end. We will look at how to raise, capture, create and design

development in languages like c++?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observing my teams’ experimentations, the python community, and reading,
I have adopted various habits, patterns, and tools. But most importantly
I learned thinking in Python. I consider thinking in Python a key for
rapid development and good engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking in a programming language affects the amount of information you
need to keep in your working memory. It also affects the abstractions
and tools that pop in your mind and then used in constructing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore what it means to think in Python. Why Python allows you to
focus on problem solving, while languages like c++ often distract your
attention from the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will cover some good and bad practices by examples while
trying to consider the amount of effort needed to write it, read it, and
talk about it with other team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways: Tips for speeding your work without compromising quality,
and reasoning for using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The audience should be comfortably familiar with the process of
software development, and software problem solving, and experience
using Python.&lt;/li&gt;

However, the basic ideas behind JIT compilers are easy to understand, as
this talk aim to show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a live-coding exercise: we will start from a blank page and
write a working (albeit simple and limited) JIT compiler from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;[Replacement talk]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk was a replacement for Stanislav Geidl's talk: From legacy
code to modern code&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honest apologies to anyone whose expectations were subverted, but
Stanislav fell sick and could not attend. Find the updated abstract
below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe experiences and lessons learned from tackling
extremely demanding code. How to bring order to mismanaged code and
elevate the code base to a standard that's acceptable in today's tech
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python makes wonderful code accessible at our fingertips, but it also
allows us to take a lot of liberty. When you start, code is beautiful
and makes sense. With each step you walk on, you find more and more
hacks showing up. Eventually, the brilliant codebase you've started with
can not be seen under the mud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every code-base can be rewritten, not everything can be redone from
scratch. Cool libraries often take a lot of liberty with code structure
and make cross-integration difficult, if not impossible. Tests sound
ideal, but in practice, they're just so hard to make right. Why is this,
and how to change it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The talk will tackle the problems in three parts:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- The Easy Wins: What to do to instantly increase the code quality in
your organisation. How? Why isn't it enough?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Patterns and Antipatterns: How to identify code that &amp;quot;smells&amp;quot;, how
to replace it? How to integrate into old code, better?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- The Philosophy: What approach to set down for the future? Why to
care? How to write replace-able code. How to prevent history from
repeating.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will close with audience discussion and experiences, questions
and proposals - building a collection of some on-premise tips and
tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

tools, command scripts, smaller applications and even large
applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Windows, it is fairly easy to build application bundles using e.g.
py2exe, but on Unix, the situation is less obvious, unless you want to
rely on OS specific Python distributions, which often require severall
100MB with of installation on the system and are usually customized in
distribution specific ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of relying on OS installed Python distributions on Unix, our
open- source eGenix PyRun provides a more or less complete Python
runtime (interpreter and stdlib modules) in a single file, which can be
&amp;quot;installed&amp;quot; by simply copying the binary to the destination system. The
file can be as small as 4.8MB for Python 3.7, by using compressors such
as upx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its size, it's also the perfect Python distribution for Docker
containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will show how PyRun works, is built, how to customize it to
include additional modules and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Both Python and Rust are getting more and more popularity. Although it
is unfair to compare them directly, this talk aims to provide a clear
comparison with a pre-defined criteria applied to a specific use-case.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Writing a simulation engine is very similar to writing a game engine
and requires certain features from a language or framework.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Possible comparison criteria:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1. Performance&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2. Simplicity&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;3. Amount of code necessary for a MVP&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;4. Utilities: docs, tests, profile&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;5. Compatibility&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

And from the time
someone introduced me to IPython, it immediately became my default
Python REPL. I enjoyed the syntax highlighting, code completion or the
instant access to the documentation. Over the years, I've picked up more
and more tricks that IPython could do: embedding IPython sessions,
starting IPython automatically when a test fails, taking advantage of
the startup files, not to mention all the various magic functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me some time to discover all those features (if there is one
thing I would like you to take away from this talk, it’s that reading
the documentation of a tool that you are using &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt; is probably a
good idea) and in this talk, I will give an overview of what you can do
with IPython REPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Some of the things I will talk about:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Documentation with ? and ??, running shell functions in IPython,
magic functions&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Profiles, startup files, configuration file, kernels, and extensions&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- How to better use IPython for debugging&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- How to use IPython for profiling&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Alternatives to IPython REPL&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for you if you are a casual user of IPython - you know some
of its features, but maybe not all of them and instead of reading
through the documentation, you would prefer to see someone giving an
overview of IPython features and how you can use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is NOT for you if you are up to date with IPython
documentation and you think you know most of its features.&lt;/p&gt;

gained over a couple years of working on custom CMS-type projects
serving large organizations. Acknowledging that approx. 30 minutes is a
short time to cover a broad subject, the focus of the talk would be on
outlining a basic strategy for managing large projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, Brian and Yann's team have built and
worked on several large Django projects for large organizations. They
will discuss how to start and manage large CMS projects, with an
emphasis on pointing people to the best reference information and
breaking down the common operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary discussion topics would cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breaking Down the Job: Over the course of the project you'll end up
accounting for thousands of details; here's how to figure out the
first few Centering Around a Prototype: Hedging your bets for the
inevitable &amp;quot;give me a ballpark figure&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing With Legacy Data Stores: Migrate legacy information early and
often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selecting 3rd Party Components: Reuse exiting app, fork it early or
Trailblaze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad News: Django Ain't Perfect - where it has weaknesses and how to
compensate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this talk the audience will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
* Break down this type of project into meaningful phases
* Migrate large dataset to populate the django models that are still under development.
* Have a rational and objective approach to select django reusable component and understand how to refine them during the different stages of the project lifecycle.
* Find and evaluate quality information about the tradeoffs Django presents in these types of projects
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Brian Curtin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have an inside look at what it takes to work on CPython, from getting
setup with the source and navigating the bug tracker, to the best
practices for having your work accepted. We'll find, categorize, and fix
an issue in Python to get you started. This talk is ideal for those who
are new to open source projects or are interested in the Python
development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People from all backgrounds, users of all platforms, and developers of
all levels are necessary in the development of Python. From writing code
to documentation, it takes all kinds of people to make an impact. If
you've used Python, we need you, and what better place to get involved
than at PyCon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2010 saw a rise in the number of contributors to CPython, and the PSF
stepped in to support the efforts of those wanting to get involved. Are
you up for the challenge? This talk dives right into what it takes to
get involved, covering the who, what, where, when, and why of Python
development, going through the whole process live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conference is over, stick around with the CPython crew and
hack away!&lt;/p&gt;
