gained over a couple years of working on custom CMS-type projects
serving large organizations. Acknowledging that approx. 30 minutes is a
short time to cover a broad subject, the focus of the talk would be on
outlining a basic strategy for managing large projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, Brian and Yann's team have built and
worked on several large Django projects for large organizations. They
will discuss how to start and manage large CMS projects, with an
emphasis on pointing people to the best reference information and
breaking down the common operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary discussion topics would cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breaking Down the Job: Over the course of the project you'll end up
accounting for thousands of details; here's how to figure out the
first few Centering Around a Prototype: Hedging your bets for the
inevitable &amp;quot;give me a ballpark figure&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing With Legacy Data Stores: Migrate legacy information early and
often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selecting 3rd Party Components: Reuse exiting app, fork it early or
Trailblaze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad News: Django Ain't Perfect - where it has weaknesses and how to
compensate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this talk the audience will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
* Break down this type of project into meaningful phases
* Migrate large dataset to populate the django models that are still under development.
* Have a rational and objective approach to select django reusable component and understand how to refine them during the different stages of the project lifecycle.
* Find and evaluate quality information about the tradeoffs Django presents in these types of projects
&lt;/pre&gt;

to create a good foundation for an asyncio-based service, including
graceful shutdowns, proper exception handling, and testing asynchronous
code. We’ll get into the hairier topics as well, covering topics like
working with synchronous code, debugging and profiling, and working with
threaded code. We’ll learn how to approach asynchronous and concurrent
programming with Python’s asyncio library, take away some best
practices, and learn what pitfalls to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline:
(40 minutes + 5 min Q&amp;amp;A, if unable to get 45 minutes, then 30 min slot
with no time for Q&amp;amp;A)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="intro-2m"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Intro (2m)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaker/company intro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting the context/purpose of talk&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Foundations (9m - trimmed to 6m for 30 min slot)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial setup of an asyncio service (2m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required boilerplate code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspiration from official asyncio tutorial docs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making a service &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; concurrent (5m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-blocking vs concurrent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;when to be concurrent vs serial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using callbacks vs awaits vs scheduling tasks (create_task) vs
asyncio.Events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making synchronous code asyncio-friendly (2m)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="intermediate-9m-trimmed-to-6m-for-30-min-slot"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Intermediate (9m - trimmed to 6m for 30 min slot)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graceful shutdowns (3m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a signal handler is, why it’s needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What signals to listen to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gotchas of cancelling tasks, asyncio.shield + shutdown behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exception handling (3m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between top-level exception handling and handling
within other coroutines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid mistakenly swallowing/missing raised exceptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making use of loop.set_exception_handler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making threaded code asyncio-“friendly” (3m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling threaded code from coroutines (aka running within a
ThreadPoolExecutor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling coroutines from from threaded code (aka
run_coroutine_threadsafe)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Testing asyncio code (7m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benefits of debug mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to mock coroutines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging an asyncio service (5m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinforce debug mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using “tricks&amp;quot; like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;asyncio.all_tasks&lt;/tt&gt; with logging,
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;loop.slow_callback_duration&lt;/tt&gt;, adding context/stack trace in default
exception handler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profiling (7m)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic profiling (cProfile, strace) - not that different from sync
code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous profiling with 3rd party tools, i.e. github.com/what-
studio/profiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyCharm’s asyncio &amp;amp; thread profiler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to properly trace a workflow/request (e.g. for the purpose of
distributed tracing) (to be cut if not enough time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Code review is not just boring duty. It's mutual responsibility for
the software we're releasing. It's one of the most critical aspects of
code quality, and therefore it's the first step of quality assurance.
This is also the key to easier programming and better maintainability.
Clean code is much easier to debug, and it's much harder to introduce
a bug in such code.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When you think about code review, you probably think about verifying
and examining the code. Reviewing the expert's code may look like a
waste of time because he knows what he's doing. Reviewing the code by
a beginner may look like a waste of time because he's not able to find
as many defects as an experienced developer. Code review is a code
quality tool in the first place, but it's also much beyond that. You
can teach or help someone, learn from somebody and much more both from
the position of reviewer and reviewee.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;There is much more about the real power of code review which I want to
share with you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk is also about how to do it the right way and how to not do
it based on lessons learned and my experience within the diverse teams
of people with a variety of knowledge and experience. I was reviewing
the code but, on the other hand, I was also being reviewed. I'd like
to pass my observations to people who are reviewing the code both in
commercial and open source projects for a while. This talk is also for
those who want to start to review the code, but they do not know how
to do it.&lt;/div&gt;

works, with random audience members, in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll then look into how Python is used for automated testing (with
pytest) against the messenger core library which is exposed through
CFFI. However, the core library will soon be ported to full Rust. Are
there better ways to interface Rust with Python than going through
C-interfaces?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third part we'll introduce first example Chat Bots, written in
Python. Do you want to send an machine-generated system allert to a
sysadmin group? Or safely archive all media that is posted to a family
group? Or have your IoT sensor react to commands or send info? Just do
it without registering a bot to some central cite, or by exposing all
content information to (e. g. Telegram) servers. A Chat Bot only needs
access to a standard IMAP/SMTP account. We'll look at the simple Python
API for writing and testing powerful and versatile Chat bots.&lt;/p&gt;

response framework focused on remote live forensics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It consists of a Python client (agent) that is installed on target
systems, and Python server infrastructure that can manage and talk to
clients. The goal of GRR is to support forensics and investigations in a
fast, scalable manner to allow analysts to quickly triage attacks and
perform analysis remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRR was started at Google in 2009 as a simple Python helper script used
by Incident Response engineers. Eventually a little Python script got a
little server component, was adapted to run on multiple systems (Mac,
Linux, Windows), then a little UI was added and a few nice features were
introduced (large-scale hunts, collection of predefined artifacts,
memory analysis). A helper script has eventually evolved into a
sophisticated framework with 180,000 lines of Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;In the presentation we’ll talk about the process of evolving a small
prototype-like Python project into a production-ready system, using
GRR as an example. The topics that we’ll cover are:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Taking shortcuts - both in terms of design and implementation.
Reasons for taking them and their eventual costs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Relying on Python’s power features (i.e. meta-classes, mixins)?
Long-term consequences on maintainability and readability.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Organising the project into separate PyPI packages - benefits of
doing that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Continuous integration, testing and automated builds for various
platforms - implementation costs and maintainability effects.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

amount of features and tools it's easy to get lost and miss some of the
less unknown modules or gems hidden within the whole load of functions
and classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk aims at showcasing some recipes, snippets and usages of
standard library modules and functions that are less known or that are
not covered in the most common books and tutorials available for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The talk will try to showcase a bunch of short examples in the hope to
foster the &amp;quot;oh, wow! I didn't think about that&amp;quot; reaction at least once
in the audience.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We will see how frequently for tasks where you used third party
libraries or frameworks a solution bultin into the standard library is
already available, and such solution is guaranteed to be maintained
and well working for the years to come thanks to the standard library
reliability and stability.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The showcased examples are took from the “Modern Python Standard Library
Cookbook” book that I authored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Inspired by the &amp;quot;Divine Comedy&amp;quot; by Dante Alighieri, I decided to
create a short guide into Agile best practices. It will guide through
Failures, Challenges to the Success in building a happy dream team!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk is divided into three parts:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1. Failures in setting up Agile processes for a team.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2. Challenges on the way to happy and successful team.&lt;/div&gt;

of volunteers are still working on the project. We have had to address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross platform GUI development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross platform packaging solutions for Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating an interactive visual debugger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating with iPython notebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating with various IoT MicroPython devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating with frameworks such as PyGame/PyGameZero and Flask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating cross platform testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researching and testing UX with a challenging user base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility for all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internationalisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating an inclusive, welcoming and supportive community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain why Mu was created, how Mu was created and, most
importantly, shares the decision making, technical research and
implementation details of Mu in the hope others can learn from our
mistakes, mis-steps and muck-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

easier than ever with serverless computing. In this talk, we’ll show how
you can use Azure Functions to easily deploy and scale your Python
workloads without having to manage any servers or pay for unused compute
resources. We’ll also show how deep integration with Visual Studio Code
offers a great local development experience with full support for
debugging and testing your app, and allows you to seamlessly deploy your
serverless code to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll start by giving a brief overview of the value of serverless
computing. Next, we'll create a brand new Python app in Visual Studio
Code, and start to add in business logic and ML capabilities. Once we
get the app running debugged locally, we’ll publish it to the cloud as a
serverless function, and demonstrate the serverless scalability.
Finally, we’ll walk you through the tools and capabilities you can
leverage around monitoring and management of your Python Azure
Functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Did you know there are multiple ways to raise and capture exceptions?

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Did you know there are multiple ways to raise and capture exceptions?
Have you ever wondered if you should raise a built-in exception or
create your own hierarchy? Did you ever find it hard to understand
what an exception meant?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk will go through the decisions needed to raise and capture
exceptions when creating a library. We will look at how to translate
and handle errors, create your own exceptions, and make exceptions
clear and easy to troubleshoot, while also understanding how they
actually work, common pitfalls.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will enable intermediate developers to leave the room with a
solid understanding of how to work effectively with exceptions. As the
exception flow usually goes untested, this will help prevent frustrating
situations when errors occur that are not easy to understand or when an
unexpected result is produced. The talk will delve into the different
ways of working with exceptions. We will illustrate this with a
real-world example to which many developers will be able to relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the talk, intermediate developers will leave the room more
informed and better prepared to create and handle exceptions, having
learned about many utilities that were already available to them, but
were never used or were used improperly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The not-so-advanced Pythonistas will get an in-depth dive into
exceptions. Even if they might not be able to grasp all of the content,
they will get a sense of the features that most programmers are unaware
of and learn to use them when the proper situation arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced programmers will find this to be a humorous talk that will
certainly teach them at least one new thing, as I will dive into parts
of the grammar of Python that even many advanced programmers are not
used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The talk is also full of niche information like why the variable that
catches exceptions doesn’t like outside of the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;except&lt;/tt&gt; scope.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The talk is comprised of four main sections preceded by an
introduction to the problem and a conclusion with time for questions
at the end. We will look at how to raise, capture, create and design
exceptions, offering tips and pitfalls in each section.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing my teams’ experimentations, the python community, and reading,
I have adopted various habits, patterns, and tools. But most importantly
I learned thinking in Python. I consider thinking in Python a key for
rapid development and good engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking in a programming language affects the amount of information you
need to keep in your working memory. It also affects the abstractions
and tools that pop in your mind and then used in constructing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore what it means to think in Python. Why Python allows you to
focus on problem solving, while languages like c++ often distract your
attention from the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will cover some good and bad practices by examples while
trying to consider the amount of effort needed to write it, read it, and
talk about it with other team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways: Tips for speeding your work without compromising quality,
and reasoning for using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The audience should be comfortably familiar with the process of
software development, and software problem solving, and experience
using Python.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honest apologies to anyone whose expectations were subverted, but
Stanislav fell sick and could not attend. Find the updated abstract
below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe experiences and lessons learned from tackling
extremely demanding code. How to bring order to mismanaged code and
elevate the code base to a standard that's acceptable in today's tech
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python makes wonderful code accessible at our fingertips, but it also
allows us to take a lot of liberty. When you start, code is beautiful
and makes sense. With each step you walk on, you find more and more
hacks showing up. Eventually, the brilliant codebase you've started with
can not be seen under the mud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every code-base can be rewritten, not everything can be redone from
scratch. Cool libraries often take a lot of liberty with code structure
and make cross-integration difficult, if not impossible. Tests sound
ideal, but in practice, they're just so hard to make right. Why is this,
and how to change it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The talk will tackle the problems in three parts:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- The Easy Wins: What to do to instantly increase the code quality in
your organisation. How? Why isn't it enough?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Patterns and Antipatterns: How to identify code that &amp;quot;smells&amp;quot;, how
to replace it? How to integrate into old code, better?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- The Philosophy: What approach to set down for the future? Why to
care? How to write replace-able code. How to prevent history from
repeating.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will close with audience discussion and experiences, questions
and proposals - building a collection of some on-premise tips and
tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Windows, it is fairly easy to build application bundles using e.g.
py2exe, but on Unix, the situation is less obvious, unless you want to
rely on OS specific Python distributions, which often require severall
100MB with of installation on the system and are usually customized in
distribution specific ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of relying on OS installed Python distributions on Unix, our
open- source eGenix PyRun provides a more or less complete Python
runtime (interpreter and stdlib modules) in a single file, which can be
&amp;quot;installed&amp;quot; by simply copying the binary to the destination system. The
file can be as small as 4.8MB for Python 3.7, by using compressors such
as upx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its size, it's also the perfect Python distribution for Docker
containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will show how PyRun works, is built, how to customize it to
include additional modules and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

and more tricks that IPython could do: embedding IPython sessions,
starting IPython automatically when a test fails, taking advantage of
the startup files, not to mention all the various magic functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me some time to discover all those features (if there is one
thing I would like you to take away from this talk, it’s that reading
the documentation of a tool that you are using &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt; is probably a
good idea) and in this talk, I will give an overview of what you can do
with IPython REPL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Some of the things I will talk about:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Documentation with ? and ??, running shell functions in IPython,
magic functions&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Profiles, startup files, configuration file, kernels, and extensions&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- How to better use IPython for debugging&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- How to use IPython for profiling&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Alternatives to IPython REPL&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for you if you are a casual user of IPython - you know some
of its features, but maybe not all of them and instead of reading
through the documentation, you would prefer to see someone giving an
overview of IPython features and how you can use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is NOT for you if you are up to date with IPython
documentation and you think you know most of its features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “clean architecture” model predates Robert Martin, who recently brought it back to the attention of the community, and is a way of structuring applications that leverages layers separation and internal APIs to achieve a very tidy, fully-tested, and loosely coupled system. The talk introduces the main ideas of the architecture, showing how the layers can be implemented in Python, following the content of the book “Clean Architectures in Python”. The book recently reached 11,000 downloads and many readers found it useful to start learning how to test software and how to structure an application without relying entirely on the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;After that we will jump to the topic of virtualenvs and  popular tools that are used for managing them. I will explain what is purpose of the virtualenvs in Python and why we should use them.
Finally we will focus on the most important topic without which development is not possible – package mangers. Package managers it is wide topic in Python world. There is many package mangers and  currently we have tools like pip, pipenv or poetry but it is not obvious which of them we should use in first place. Which of them are recommended to use? What are prons and cons of certain package mangers? Is there any other not well known packages mangers? How package mangers are packaging Python code? Which of the package mangers are good for data scientists? Is your package manger is resolving dependencies?
This questions can appear especially when you are beginner and just to want start working with Python. Unfortunately form the beginning you must face the problem which of the package manger you should use. In this presentation I will answer all of this questions. I will list popular package mangers and some not known. I will show differences and which of them are best for which case. Also I will explain differences between packages that are used by different packages mangers. If you are interested in code development and package mangers or you are just confused which of them you should use this presentation is definitely for you. During this presentation I will answer all questions and I will wipe out all doubts about packages, package mangers and virtualenvs.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MongoDB is webscale, right? It's a JSON database, it's eventually consistent, and you use map-reduce to query it. Oh, and it's insecure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me clear up some things: MongoDB is an ACID-compliant database with transactions, schemas &amp;amp; relationships. It includes a powerful aggregation query language; map-reduce has been deprecated for some time now. MongoDB doesn't speak or store JSON, and nowadays it comes with pretty good security defaults (we think).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many myths around about MongoDB - what it is, how it works, and what it does wrong. Like any database product, you need to know its capabilities and how to get the best out of it. On top of this, the product has changed a lot over the years, but lots of information out there hasn't caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll cover 8 myths around MongoDB, explain how they're wrong, why the myth originated in the first place (some of them weren't originally myths).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What exactly is MongoDB?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the current release of MongoDB?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB is not a JSON database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB has transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB allows relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should only consider sharding if you must.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB is secure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB stores your data reliably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB is a big product, with lots to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I'll explain some of MongoDB's best-kept secrets, and provide practical tips and tricks for using it. The audience will leave with a good idea of what MongoDB is, what it isn't, and how to best develop with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorting is one of those things that we take for granted in Python. The built-in &amp;quot;sorted&amp;quot; function knows how to sort any iterable of objects that are themselves sortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hiding behind that simple description is a great deal of depth. In this talk, I'll go deep into what it means to sort, and how we can sort any collection of Python data.  We'll see how you can use custom functions to sort built-in data structures in new and interesting ways.  And we'll see how you can design your own custom classes such that they will sort in just the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching this talk, you'll have a better understanding of sorting, built-in data structures, function objects, and how &amp;quot;magic methods&amp;quot; affect the our Python classes.  Moreover, you'll be able to write clearer, shorter, and more easily understood code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics I'll address in this talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;sorted&amp;quot; and Timsort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorting a list of simple structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reversing the direction with &amp;quot;reverse&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom sorting with &amp;quot;key&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stable sort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorting a list of dicts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &amp;quot;lambda&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using operator.itemgetter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorting a list of named tuples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorting a list of objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making your object sortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The functools.total_ordering decorator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an intermediate-level talk; I'll assume that anyone attending knows how to write functions, classes, and methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPython seems like a fancy Python shell. Why do we need it when we have PyCharm, VSCode, and other IDEs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk you'll learn how to use the power of IPython for rapid development and how you can integrate it with existing tools. We'll cover magic commands, calling external process, usage of extended history, async/await and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll also learn on some popular extension and cool configuration hacks (such as &lt;cite&gt;%autoreload 2&lt;/cite&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Jupyter is based on IPython, you'll be able to use all of what you
learned in Jupyter Lab/Notebooks as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is intended to explain to participants what is happening under the hood when they are playing around with different python built-in data structures. Explain the concepts such that they are not surprised by the behavior of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-requisites:
Anyone who knows built-in python data structures like List, Dictionaries, set, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity questions that the talk answers:
1. What happens to the memory address when * operator is used?
2. When does python create a new object in memory?
3. What does it refer to the mutability and immutability of objects in Python?
4. If the outer object is immutable but the reference objects are mutable. Can the elements be added?
5. What is the difference at the memory level when we refer to deep copy and shallow copy in lists?
6. Operations like List.sort and sorted in python? What to use, when to use? What happens at the memory level?
7. What is the difference between is vs ==? When should it be used?
8. Lots and lots of interesting examples.
9. How do we determine the memory reference id associated with the object?
10. Meaning of assigning a value to a variable in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing slides use screenshots. But, I'll be including more interesting examples and would replace the screenshots with GIFs. So, that folks get a feeling of live coding and remain interested in the presentation. Along with the visual representation of what is happening at the memory level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications and libraries with a pluggable architecture allow developers to add custom functionality. Plugins can customize user interfaces, create new workflows, and interface with legacy systems. Designing a plugin is often difficult - documentation is sparse, outdated, or non-existent. You end up diving into a unfamiliar codebase to figure out what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk examines Pluggable Architecture by creating a custom plugin system: we will design an interface, think about where to hook in custom behavior, and discuss testing techniques. Understanding these principles will enable us to write custom plugins for third-party libraries. Extend the functionality of your favourite library without touching existing code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serverless is revolutionary and will dominate the future of Cloud. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) however—with its stateless and short-lived functions is only the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s needed is a next-generation Serverless platform and programming model for general-purpose application development in the new world of real-time data and event-driven systems. What is missing is ways to manage distributed state in a scalable and available fashion, support for long-lived virtual stateful services, ways to physically co-locate data and processing, and options for choosing the right data consistency model for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss the challenges, requirements, and introduce you to our proposed solution: Cloudstate—an Open Source project building the next generation Stateful Serverless, running on Kubernetes, Akka, gRPC, Knative, and GraalVM, with polyglot support for Python, Java, Go, JavaScript, Swift, Scala, Python, Kotlin, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people like Python for its simplicity and beauty. But every statement in Python, even the simple one, produces a lot of events during the program execution. These events are usually hidden from a user, so it helps developers to skip low-level implementation details and focus on bigger things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time many parts of this hidden information are very useful and interesting to examine. The good news is that Python Runtime allows to retrieve it really simply, so there is no need to configure additional libraries or pass additional parameters to interpreter. Everybody can do it right inside their Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk we will learn how Python allows to inspect current program state during the execution. We will learn about Python variables, frame objects and useful information they store. After that we will discuss several powerful tools which are based on the runtime information and which can be helpful for any Python programmer in their everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Command-line applications and interfaces are used by both newcomers and experienced Python developers everyday. But do you know how they came to be? Hop on to this ship as we go through the CLI galaxy and look at its history, explore the CLI anatomy and discover some Python packages that can help us create them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll then look at some widely used CLIs of our time. And emulate one of them by creating our own CLI using Click. Finally, we’ll package it and publish it on PyPI. Are you ready to travel faster-than-light using this ship’s Infinite Improbability Drive? Carry your towel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I am going to present possible approaches for a Python 3 migration of existing Python code running on Python 2.7. I'll evaluate which of these approaches seems suitable for a large code base and which principles should be paid attention to to increase the probability of a successful migration project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll use union.cms (a content management system used by German trade unions) to show the story of a successful migration project involving nearly one million lines of Python code. The story will include the obstacles we encountered and what we learned on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that most of the discussed ideas and experience can also be used unchanged in smaller projects as the presented principles are very much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal of the presentation: You should be able to come up with a plan for migrating your Python 2 based projects to Python 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to introduce data pipeline developers to QuantumBlack's approach for keeping data pipelines healthy and sustainable and facilitating collaboration between data scientists and data engineers by using our open source framework, Kedro. Attendees need between novice and intermediate knowledge of Python (enough to understand syntactic sugar and funargs) in order to appreciate this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As data continues to inform more and more business strategy, high quality, fully featured data pipelines have never been more critical. Small data scripts and single-coder science projects are not enough to keep up with the pace of day-to-day business and their ever-growing list of requirements. Now, more than ever, we need data engineers and data scientists to collaborate effectively. Yet, these two parties come with inherently competing needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data scientists need high data volatility and parameterization, for experimentation, and data engineers, on the other hand, need stability and performance, to deliver data. Furthermore, as pipelines grow, the cost of knowledge transfer and training new team members also increases. How can we get scientists and engineers to work well together, and sustain pipeline growth as the team also grows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this, QuantumBlack created Kedro, a framework for writing data pipelines that addresses both the needs for flexibility and stability in its features and patterns of use. By using Kedro’s tools and operating model, we have enabled our teams to scale our single-developer, micro-pipes to industrial sized data processors with dozens of developers; all without sacrificing readability, quality, or stability. This talk will show you how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A famous book introduction says:
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;The only valid measurement of code quality: WTFs/minute&lt;/tt&gt;. In this
talk I’d like to share my past and current experience on how to write
good and clean code and what to do and not to do to achieve good shape
programs. Sounds interesting uh? Have you ever thought what is the cost
vs revenue of a well written code and of an ugly code? Nowadays, in most
companies, code bases are huge (in terms of lines of code and
complexity) and the number of contributors is also high; this means that
a well shaped code could benefit the company finance and the mental
health of the employees (AKA software engineers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing clean (and/or good) code requires discipline. This discipline
can be acquired and increased during your job and doing experience with
messy code, but more important is that using discipline, respecting and
following some rules you can achieve elegant and efficient code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will cover some principles of clean code (they are too
much for 30 minutes): - Meaningful Names - Formatting - Tests and their
importance - Continuous Integration - Code Refactoring - Code Review -
Boundaries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the work contained in this talk is mostly inspired by the book
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Clean Code - Robert C. Martin (AKA Uncle Bob)&lt;/tt&gt; and the experience I
have made during my current job and the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La disponibilità di API è spesso un requisito fondamentale per
l’integrazione di Odoo con terze parti. Tuttavia la mancanza di una
piattaforma REST nativa su Odoo è un ostacolo, a cui è tuttavia semplice
porre rimedio in maniera sistematica e organizzata con il framework
messo a disposizione da OCA Odoo fornisce di default un’interfaccia RPC
per le integrazioni di terze parti, ma non un set di API REST. Per
ovviare a questa mancanza, OCA, la comunità open-source di Odoo, ha
sviluppato un insieme di moduli che aggiungono un framework molto solido
e robusto per la realizzazione di API REST, con una integrazione nativa
di Swagger, un sistema di validazione dei dati in ingresso e in uscita,
e meccanismi di versionamento delle API stesse. In questo talk vedremo
come utilizzare questo framework per realizzare API REST su Odoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s build an event driven application together! Using Flask as
framework we’ll add the powerful Apache Kafka, a streaming platform, as
backend… all live on stage! Join to understand how to integrate your
application with Apache Kafka! Solid event driven applications are based
on a widely adopted coding framework and a resilient data streaming
technology. While Flask is a common choice for the framework, a wise
selection of the backend data systems can bring benefits in terms of
ease of integration and performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session we will explore Apache Kafka, a data streaming platform,
that enables reliable real-time data integration for your event driven
application. We will look at the types of problems that Kafka is best at
solving, and show how to use it in your own applications. We’ll then
take a look at Kafka in action, by creating a Flask web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After understanding how to produce and consume events from Apache Kafka,
we’ll then introduce Kafka Connect, a selection of pre-built connectors
making Apache Kafka your only backend interface, no matter where your
data originally sits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re using Flask, and want to understand how to make your
application event driven by integrating it with the most used streaming
technology, this session is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is for those people who know basic python but are looking
forward to writing better and cleaner python code. Python has always
been known for its easy-to-understand syntax. This talk will empower all
developers and give perspective on how can you write code in a much more
elegant way. Linting is the automated checking of your source code for
programmatic and stylistic errors. Linters analyze source code to flag
programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.
This is done by using a lint tool. Python being one of the most elegant
language has got a wide variety of listing tools available that can help
programmers in Code formatting and styling their code in the best
suitable form. Python has got some advance listing tools like pylint and
flake8. In this talk we will have a great deal of discussion around how
these linters can be used and how these tools can help you find more
bugs and improve your code quality. These linting tools finds problems
that are typically caught by a compiler for less dynamic languages. We
will also discuss about how can we manage import orders, code
formatting, checking security vulnerabilities, managing dependencies etc
using these tools. There are also code analysis tools that provide other
insights into your code. While maybe not linters by definition, these
tools are usually used side-by-side with linters. They too hope to
improve the quality of the code. It’s useful to have linters run against
your code frequently. If automation and consistency aren’t there, it’s
easy for a large team or project to lose sight of the goal and start
creating lower-quality code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will be able to learn 1. What is a linter? 2. Famous linting
solutions like pylint and flake 8 3. Use cases like ordering imports,
finding error bugs 4. Managing dependency in python with these linter
tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Racconto la mia esperienza come UX/UI Designer che da 4 anni collabora
con un team di sviluppatori Python, due mondi affini che possono però
sentirsi distanti e parlare lingue differenti. Come, con un po’ di
impegno, siamo riusciti a trovare un equilibrio fra call, metodologie e
qualche birra. Racconto la mia esperienza con un team di sviluppatori
Python. Quando quattro anni fa ho iniziato a collaborare con loro ho
sentito per la prima volta parlare di Django, Agile, DevOps… arabo per
me che venivo da un mondo di colori e creatività. Come designer avevo
sempre lavorato da freelance con sviluppatori e agenzie, progettando
interfacce che venivano poi implementate, in molti casi il mio lavoro
finiva con la consegna del mockup che veniva “dato in pasto” a
sviluppatori nella maggior parte dei casi sconosciuti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lavorando in un team coordinato e collaborativo siamo riusciti a trovare
dei punti di incontro fra design thinking e continuous delivery,
inserendo nel processo una fase di discovery che include indagini e
co-design per migliorare i prodotti e l’esperienza degli utenti.&lt;/p&gt;

has never been more important. Thankfully, we will use tools like ASDF
to make this incredibly easy, as well as examine its similar benefits
for Node.js/NPM and &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of other languages and tools, all via
extensible plugins. For Fish shell users, we will see how VirtualFish
makes it easy to create, upgrade, and activate virtual environments in
ways that have never been available before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will explore how powerful command-line tools like Zoxide,
Bat, RipGrep-All + fzf, and others can be used to dramatically increase
our terminal console productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees of this talk will take home the following knowledge and
skills:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to automate dotfile configuration management and deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to build and manage multiple Python interpreter versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to more efficiently manage Python virtual environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to use powerful command-line tools to increase terminal console
productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll investigate the way humans perceive plans and unexpected events.
Do we have biases in estimates? Why is it so hard to respect deadlines
for a dev team? Is it just a wrong planning methodology? Are there
fundamental limits in the way our brain makes plans? Has it always been
like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll investigate the way humans perceive plans and unexpected events.
We’ll find out that we have biases in the way we make plans and
predictions. Problems are not limited to the planning phase though. When
the first issues occur during the project, we tend to take decisions
like increasing the team or taking shortcut that might not have the
desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source code level optimization is often neglected - people don’t bother,
because getting a faster server often gives better results. But if you -
like me - always wonder what is the most efficient way to write some
code, then this talk is for you! Did you know that Python preallocates
integers from -5 to 257? Reusing them 1000 times, instead of allocating
memory for a bigger integer, can save you a couple milliseconds of
code’s execution time. If you want to learn more about this kind of
optimizations then, … well, probably this presentation is not for you :)
Instead of going into such small details, I will talk about more “sane”
ideas for writing faster code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief overview of different levels of optimization and how they
work in Python, I will show you simple and fast ways of measuring the
execution time of your code and finally, discuss examples of how some
code structures could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will see: * The fastest way of removing duplicates from a list *
How much faster your code is when you reuse the built-in functions
instead of trying to reinvent the wheel * What is faster than the “for
loop” * If the lookup is faster in a list or a set * When it’s better
to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have an inside look at what it takes to work on CPython, from getting
setup with the source and navigating the bug tracker, to the best
practices for having your work accepted. We'll find, categorize, and fix
an issue in Python to get you started. This talk is ideal for those who
are new to open source projects or are interested in the Python
development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People from all backgrounds, users of all platforms, and developers of
all levels are necessary in the development of Python. From writing code
to documentation, it takes all kinds of people to make an impact. If
you've used Python, we need you, and what better place to get involved
than at PyCon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2010 saw a rise in the number of contributors to CPython, and the PSF
stepped in to support the efforts of those wanting to get involved. Are
you up for the challenge? This talk dives right into what it takes to
get involved, covering the who, what, where, when, and why of Python
development, going through the whole process live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conference is over, stick around with the CPython crew and
hack away!&lt;/p&gt;
