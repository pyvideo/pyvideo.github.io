&lt;p&gt;Documentarians have long struggled to get buy-in from stakeholders and
win more budget because the impact of docs on a company’s bottom line
has never been clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things like traffic analysis, at best, tell you whether customers are
facing a recurring problem, or if they’re finding your docs easily.
Article ratings also help you understand if customers find your docs
useful. But to prove that docs actually impact your bottom line, you
need to dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll share new models I’ve designed to help measure if
your docs drive customer growth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would your company look like without docs? (A basic control for
measuring success)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do your docs help win new users? (Acquisition-focused attribution)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users who read your docs more likely to take the key steps to
become customers? (Activation-focused attribution)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can docs help convert new customers into loyal advocates?
(Retention-focused attribution)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll demonstrate how you can apply these models to your business, with
both theoretical and practical advice.&lt;/p&gt;
