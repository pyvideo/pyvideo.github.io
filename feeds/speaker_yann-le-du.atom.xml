&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Imaging, we are faced with a
deconvolution problem that has a strong impact on the image actually
reconstructed. Faced with the need of mapping the distribution of
organic matter in Terrestrial and Martian rock samples for applications
in exobiology, we needed to see how to extract a maximum amount of
information from our data: our approach uses reservoir computing
artificial neural networks coupled to a particle swarm algorithm that
evolves the reservoirs’ weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code runs on the Hybrid Processing Units for Science (HPU4Science)
cluster located at the Laboratoire de Chimie de la Matière Condensée de
Paris (LCMCP). The cluster is composed of a central data storage machine
and a heterogeneous ensemble of 6 decentralized nodes. Each node is
equipped with a Core2 Quad or i7 CPU and 3-7 NVIDIA Graphical Processing
Units (GPUs) including the GF110 series. Each of the 28 GPUs
independently explores a different parameter space sphere of the same
problem. Our application shows a sustained real performance of 15.6
TFLOPS. The HPU4Science cluster cost
&lt;span class="formula"&gt;36, 090&lt;i&gt;resulting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;432.3&lt;i&gt;MFLOPS&lt;/i&gt; ⁄ &lt;/span&gt; cost performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That talk is meant to demonstrate on a practical case how consumer grade
computer hardware coupled to a very popular computer language can be
used to tackle a difficult yet very elementary scientific problem: how
do you go from formulating the problem, to choosing the right hardware
and software, and all the way to programming the algorithms using the
appropriate development tools and methodologies (notably Literate
Programming). On the math side, the talk requires a basic understanding
of matrix algebra and of the discretization process involved when
computing integrals.&lt;/p&gt;
