&lt;p&gt;This session will tell the all too uncommon story of how I joined a tech
start-up and learned to code as a plucky 40-year old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having opted out of studying computer science at university because I
didn't fit in with the geeky, tech-loving boys in my classes, I joined
the Python community 20 years later than most and taught myself through
trial, error and a lot of Stack Overflow searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll explain why people still do a double-take when they hear I'm a tech
start-up COO, why a career doesnâ€™t have to be a straight line, and why
an analytical mindset, not an engineering background, is key for
learning to program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll reflect on what could have persuaded a young me to give computer
science a go, explain why kids having smartphones and RaspberryPis to
play with at home hasn't solved this problem, and challenge attendees to
commit to mentoring someone in their life who has never coded before.&lt;/p&gt;
