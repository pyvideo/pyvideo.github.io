But we can figure out times and days that are most likely to have breakdowns as delays on our own,  and use this to improve our commute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily,  this talk is about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting up a system to gather unique information about train performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding factors that correlate with delays and complaints about poor train experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using this information to find the best times to avoid,  and where there's the most value in waking up early to commute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making this information accessible and convenient for me and my friends/ co-workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
