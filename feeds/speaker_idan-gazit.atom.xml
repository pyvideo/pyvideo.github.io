Most of the information we take in on the web is textual in nature. It
behooves us, as writers and curators of text, to know about the art and
science of presenting textual information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk isn’t about art, or science, but technique. Typesetting has a
rich history, dating back to Mr. Gutenberg and his printing press.
Although digital type is fairly mature by now, type on the web is still
very much in its infancy. We are only now gaining typographical controls
that the publishing industry has taken for granted these last 20 years.
I'll be taking you on tour of the current state of type on the web: what
we can do today, and what we will be able to do tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some highlights: _ A reintroduction to font-face and the nitty-gritty
details of how it works _ Advanced typography with CSS3 font-features
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=font-feature"&gt;http://caniuse.com/#feat=font-feature&lt;/a&gt;) _ Icon fonts, and semantic use
thereof _ JavaScript tools like fittext.js and lettering.js&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Idan Gazit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-source world is and always has been focused on code; attention
and respect doled out in exchange for patches. As a result, many
open-source projects want for design love but don't know how to secure
it. We scare off potential contributors from the many fields beneath the
aegis of &amp;quot;design&amp;quot;: user experience, user interfaces, usability,
interaction design, information architects, graphic design, typography,
and other roles assumed by the authors of our markup and styling. Django
can be a model citizen among open-source projects in changing these
attitudes and coaxing contributors out of the woodwork -- not just for
the benefit of the framework, but for the constellation of 3rd party
apps which make Django great. Other FOSS communities have made efforts
that we can learn from, and the fight to change perceptions is less
uphill than you might think. This talk will cover: - Misconceptions of
&amp;quot;Design.&amp;quot; What is design, and what do designers do? - A brief trip down
memory lane, and how Django came to be relatively designer- friendly. -
&amp;quot;I don't get it: what is the BDesignFL role?&amp;quot; - Process and tools: How
can Django better engage designers, for core's benefit and for the
benefit of &lt;em&gt;your projects&lt;/em&gt;. How can we help these contributors get over
the &amp;quot;suck&amp;quot; threshold? - What parts of core are ripe for love from
designers? What 3rd party projects?&lt;/p&gt;

means for organizing your thoughts visually. Just as good writing
requires drafts, good design requires sketches: low-investment,
low-resolution braindumps. Learn how to use ugly sketching to iterate
your way to a better product.&lt;/p&gt;

meaning. There are tools and science that can inform your choice of data
to present and how best to present it. We reflexively evaluate data and
fit it into a narrative which aids decisionmaking; learn how to take
advantage of this tendency in order to deliver meaning, not just numbers
and charts.&lt;/p&gt;
