These benefits can be directly applied to the SciPy stack, community, and conference. In this talk we present an analysis of the gender diversity of SciPy Conference speakers over the years. We compare these statistics to external diversity surveys of academia and industry, and use the results to develop metrics that evaluate the success of the diversity efforts of the conference. Additionally, we will showcase the work of the diversity committee for this yearâ€™s conference and our efforts going forward, including using the methodology developed from the gender diversity speaker statistics on self-reported demographic data of conference attendees that we are collecting for the first time this year.&lt;/p&gt;
