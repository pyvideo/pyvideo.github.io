The Virtual Brain (TVB) is an open-source scientific software written in
Python for advanced simulations of complex brain dynamics. TVB can be used in
a client-server configuration, such that its web-based interface can be
accessed remotely, or as a standalone cross-platform Python library through a
scripting interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will begin by briefly explaining the motivations and science
behind TVB. This will be followed by a description of TVB's architecture and
main functionalities, including: simulation of neural activity; modification
and visualization of brain connectivity and network dynamics; and, analysis
of time-series. Lastly, I will show you that getting started with brain
simulations is just one Jupyter notebook away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With TVB you might not be able to build smart brains (yet), but you can build
one of the most realistic approximations to the physics of a human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
