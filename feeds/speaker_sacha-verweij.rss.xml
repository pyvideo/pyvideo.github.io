It should
be accessible (and hopefully useful!) to scientists, engineers, and
anyone else with technical computing needs. We will show you why Julia
is special, demonstrate how easy it is to come to Julia from a Python
background, and get you writing your first Julia programs. We will
provide an overview of Juliaâ€™s syntax, core language features such as
multiple dispatch, standard library functionality, and package system.
Short interactive exercises woven throughout the tutorial will reinforce
all topics we cover, and afterwards we will integrate your new skills
via hands-on exploration of a few applications.Presenter(s): Speaker:
Jane Herriman, Director of Diversity and Outreach , Julia Computing
Speaker: Sacha Verweij, Stanford University&lt;/p&gt;
