She's been using python for various research projects in her area of multimedia content analysis for almost 20 years and somewhat accidentally arrived at the point of teaching python and, in particular, Jupyter Notebooks for data analytics and visualisation. This talk will describe how python is used in the background of EU projects for driver assistance systems, the Smart Stadium for Smarter Living initiative with Croke Park and for the latest deep learning for computer vision research. Suzanne will also discuss some experiences in using python for public tech courses, undergraduate programmes and data analytics specialisations.&lt;/p&gt;
