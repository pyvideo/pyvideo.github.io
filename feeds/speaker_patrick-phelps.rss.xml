&lt;p&gt;How does IPython Notebook (also known as Jupyter Notebook) change how data intensive teams work? This talk focuses on how the Search and Ads teams at Yelp adopted IPython notebook and how it changed how analysis is undertaken and communicated. Tradeoffs between ease-of-use and reusable code production will also be discussed along with security implications of adoption in an enterprise context.&lt;/p&gt;
