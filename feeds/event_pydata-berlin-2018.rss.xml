In this
tutorial, we will learn about what is the likelihood function and how do
we use it for inference. Using PyMC3, I will demonstrate how to get the
likelihood from a model, how does it connect to inference using NUTS or
Variational approximation, and some practical usage of the model
likelihood to perform model comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;

clarity about the underlying technologies is crucial to designing the

a single algorithm might fall short in order to achieve the desired
results. We compare and contrast, A/B testing and reinforcement learning
based techniques in our search for optimal algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

and even our own e-mails!), and we have no excuse to not analyse it. In
this workshop, we will learn some tips and tricks to deal with messy
text data, before moving on to some lesser looked at text analysis
techniques, such as text summarisation, working with distance metrics,
and an old personal favorite - topic models.&lt;/p&gt;

training data for one or all of the classes may be limited. We will
examine how semi- supervised learning using Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) can be used to improve generalization in these settings.
The full approach from training to model deployment will be
demonstrated, using AWS Lambda and/or AWS Sagemaker&lt;/p&gt;
