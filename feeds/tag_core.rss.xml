&lt;p&gt;Presented by Catherine Devlin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python wants YOU to help maintain and extend the language we love so
much... but maybe you don't know how to go about making your
contribution. Catherine doesn't either. David Murray, an experienced
Python contributor, will guide her - and you - through the process, live
and unscripted. Come take part in learner-controlled instruction. No C
programming required!&lt;/p&gt;

without contributors, Django would never improve. However, as a newcomer
to Django, the prospect of contributing may be somewhat daunting. This
presentation will show you how to make the transition from user to
contributor -- what to do, how to do it, and some guidelines on how to
do the job well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this presentation is to explain how we do things in the core,
and how to work with us to get the job done. It will cover dealing with
Trac and the triage lifecycle, how to find tickets to triage, other
non-obvious ways to contribute, and cover some basic design
philosophies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Richard Jones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present a whirlwind update of the state of Python as of
June 2010. It will cover the evolution of the language itself, its
variants, versions and veracity. It will cover the state of packaging,
distributing and pypi.&lt;/p&gt;
