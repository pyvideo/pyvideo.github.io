achieve? What if it could help improve people's lives by solving some of
their health problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the medical tech industry kept promising a system to help
automatically manage insulin for type 1 diabetic people and never
delivering, some people got together to find ways to do it with the tech
they already had. Over the past few years, a &amp;quot;closed-loop&amp;quot; system has
been developed to algorithmically regulate people's blood sugars. After
reverse engineering bluetooth sensors and 915 MHz insulin pumps, the
system became possible. As a diabetic, I also built this system and saw
my sugar values stabilize much more than I could ever achieve doing it
manually myself. Now I'm working on contributing back to the projects as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about this system, from a technical side as well as a
personal side. I'll talk about OpenAPS (the open artificial pancreas
system) and how it works, what problems it solves, and its safety and
security concerns. I also want to show how it's helped me, and what this
means for my health now and in the future. I ultimately want to show how
we, as software developers, can change people's lives through the code
we write.&lt;/p&gt;
