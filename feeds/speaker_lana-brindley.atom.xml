moments that encourage industries to become better regulated, in order
to prevent further disasters. The IT industry has had many moments that
could be considered consequential enough to encourage better regulation,
but the changes have never been made. Because the industry has avoided
effective regulation for so long, it is possible that we are hurtling
towards a disaster of epic proportions, one that we haven't even managed
to conceive of yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will go through some historical examples of disasters
leading to regulation in other industries, and the measures that were
put into place to mitigate the problem. I will also address some of the
major moments from the IT industry that should have prompted regulation,
and haven't. Finally, I will discuss ways that documentation
professionals are uniquely placed to identify, and potentially blow the
whistle on, potential disasters before they happen.&lt;/p&gt;
