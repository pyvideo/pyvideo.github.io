&lt;p&gt;This talk goes over how Vox Media built a content similarity tool for journalists, including algorithm selection, input weighting, UI design, and user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of reading a news article, we sometimes find ourselves wanting more - more context, more insight, perhaps something related that dives deeper. In this talk, I will explain how we built a tool in Python for journalists to discover related content from a large corpus of articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll go over some of the different models we tried (given the abundance of machine learning and NLP libraries in Python) and how we eventually settled on Word2Vec. I will also talk about how we worked with journalists to incrementally improve the tool - from minor tweaks like assigning higher weights to title words vs article body words to the ability to feed in external seed articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intended Audience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python developers who are interested in machine learning and neural networks&lt;/p&gt;
