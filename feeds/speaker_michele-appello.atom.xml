She will discuss the background of GDPR in terms of data privacy, the core points and key definitions in the regulation, the list of steps companies need to take and show some examples of what the industry is doing to prepare for the May 25th implementation date. She hopes that audience members will walk away from the keynote with a better understanding of the GDPR and how it can affect them and their companies â€“ as well as gain insights on how their day to day work can be impacted by the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
