non-linear workflows and is jam-packed with sensors and robots, you are
quickly faced with software engineering challenges that call for modern
tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python turns out to be surprisingly versatile in this setting, whether
for prototyping a single conveyor belt or taming a building full of
robots. This talk explains how to use Python for interfacing with two
common industrial automation devices: a barcode scanner and a
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). After a simple demo, you’ll hear
about lessons learned using Python packages that weren’t written with
robots in mind, like Celery and pandas, with robots.&lt;/p&gt;

(PLC). It's the small box that has a memory card and an Ethernet cable
on one side, and lots of colorful wires connected to the other end.
Inside runs the logic that turns inputs from sensors into outputs to
robots, conveyor belts and other machinery. PLCs evolved from relay
banks in the 1970s and have ruled the world of industrial automation
since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of this talk we will take a look at how they work, how
to program them, and why a strange language called &amp;quot;ladder logic&amp;quot; is
(still) the lingua franca for programming them. In a short on-stage demo
I will write some PLC code to control a device on stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's 2019 now and just running a PLC isn't quite enough anymore.
Everyone is talking about the &amp;quot;Industrial Internet of Things&amp;quot; and they
have connected their PLCs to the company network. The second half of the
talk will look at how we can connect to PLCs to read data and influence
the running program with Python.&lt;/p&gt;

industrial automation, remote monitoring, and everywhere else where
machines talk to each other or to a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is an introduction to MQTT for Pythonistas. I’ll start with a
brief overview of basic concepts of the protocol. The rest of the
presentation will be a sequence of code examples in CPython and
Micropython/CircuitPython, building up to a demo with several devices
publishing data to each other. Along the way, you will see a few of the
most common tools for debugging MQTT communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After attending this talk you will have a high level idea of Python use
cases in automation, seen some examples of coding Python for
microcontrollers, and know a whole lot more about four letters that look
like an acronym but aren’t actually one. No prior experience with
automation or microcontrollers is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
