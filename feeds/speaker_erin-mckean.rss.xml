years working on dictionaries and other reference books. Reference books
and dictionaries have a lot of similarities with documentation: they're
both genres of writing that aim to explain and educate, and are aimed at
an audience that is largely goal-oriented and impatient. In this talk,
I'll give a little bit of background on how reference books
(particularly dictionaries and thesauruses) are made, talk about my
experience in publishing has informed writing documentation and
tutorials (and working with Swagger/OpenAPI), and give some examples of
habits I had to un-learn, too!&lt;/p&gt;
