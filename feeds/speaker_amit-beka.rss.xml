getting it right architecturally is harder than expected. Let's dive
into the problems I've encountered and an elegant-yet-simple solution to
make it really work. We'll look at understanding conversation not as a
pipeline, but as an orchestra of many components playing together
towards a shared goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 6 years I've been working on a complex NLU system to
understand human discourse, and have seen many approaches and promises
to solve it &amp;quot;easily&amp;quot;. This talk will unfold the journey of our
architecture from a simple pipeline to more complex solutions,
highlighting the difficulties of current approaches to tackle real
conversations with real users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the problem from a different angle, we'll develop an elegant
structure of NLU applications as an orchestra of many components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed solution naturally handles many problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing requirements, like new intents or entities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-linear dependencies between components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the full conversation as context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
