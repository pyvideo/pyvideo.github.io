&lt;p&gt;Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One man's journey to internalizing the phrase &amp;quot;computer programs are
just bits&amp;quot;. It's merely a phrase, but one that can be deeply appreciated
if time is taken to appreciate it. Talk will roughly be about bytes,
types, computation theory, language design, and some life stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with a bunch of Python 3 code written in another
language. What followed were explorations as to what it really means to
be programming. Why are some languages easier to learn (Python)? Why is
it easier to make mistakes in some languages (JavaScript)? And why are
some languages totally alien (APL and its family)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What role does familiarity play in being productive in a language? Why
are there different paradigms in programming? What about the correctness
of programs? Is one paradigm more correct than others? This talk
explores the history of computer science, programming and the potential
for the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this talk tries to answer the question: is programming for
humans or for machines? And what role Python plays in it. The question
on the future is left to the audience to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This talk aims to show what
monads are, and why you shouldn't be afraid of them. You most likely use
them already (yes, really).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll touch briefly on category theory (don't worry, it's
not scary), and a couple of practical implementation of monads. You
don't have to be a functional programmer or a Haskeller to use monads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly I shall attempt to lay out a good rationale to use more monads
when programming in Python&lt;/p&gt;
