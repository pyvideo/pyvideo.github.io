regulation on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the
European Union. GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018 and was the cause
of the “Great Privacy Policy Update” that occurred in the weeks prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover what GDPR is and why you should care about it, but
we won’t stop there. This is not going to be another talk on data
protection policy. No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’re going to jump right into discussing HOW to implement
data patterns that comply with regulations like GDPR by examining a
pattern known as pseudonymization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudonymization is a data de-identification procedure where fields of
personally identifiable information (PII) within a data record are
replaced by one or more artificial identifiers. These artificial
identifiers are also called pseudonyms. Pseudonyms make a data record
less identifiable without sacrificing data analysis and processing. GDPR
requires that PII undergo either pseudonymization or complete data
anonymization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the hands-on portion of this talk, we’ll construct a Django User
Model where we apply pseudonyms to the data attributes which qualify as
PII. We’ll explore a couple strategies for implementing a compliant
pseudonymization pattern, examining their individual approaches and
performance, and we’ll discuss limitations of pseudonymizing certain
attributes and how to achieve compliance through consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDPR sets a precedent for responsible data management. Whether your
application serves citizens of the EU or not, the regulations serve as
an encouragement for protecting your user’s identities. This talk is
great for everyone from beginners to expert Django developers… and fans
of Phil Collins :)&lt;/p&gt;
