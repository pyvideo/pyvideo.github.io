and think, “how did this happen?” Be it a large swath of unorganized
content or a lack of a clear strategy, the complications of bad docs
aren’t just a curse for documentation editors. Our readers see it, too.
It leads to confused support requests and possibly a loss of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started at Joyent, I was continuously made aware of documentation
that needed help, and it felt like a nonstop firefight. Over time, I was
able to quell the fires, create a content strategy, and completely
redefine how our documentation works. Then all of my work was blown up a
second time ‐ this time, starting from scratch with a not yet existing
product. From this experience, I’ve learned it’s all about being
organized and having a clear strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to get buy‐in for a documentation do‐over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to pivot from rewriting docs to starting from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;content strategy (and how to write a great one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;empathy for our readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting easy‐to‐follow guidelines for non‐professional writers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also touch on how to prioritize and manage all of this work
without additional full‐time documentation help.&lt;/p&gt;
