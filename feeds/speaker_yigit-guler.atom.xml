Although it is most
popular in the web development ecosystem, it has a wide area of usage
from system management to IoT devices. With Celery, transforming a
function into a task is quite easy and can add great performance
&amp;amp; usability to the applications that we build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to give attendants a general overview on Celery and
its uses. We will walk through the core Celery architecture by
introducing key components with the help of various real-world
examples. This will also lead to an understanding of the task queue
systems in general. Attendants will also gain knowledge about
Celerybeat; a tool that focuses on scheduling tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be looking for the answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a distributed task queue?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the main elements of Celery?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When should we use Celery tasks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we use Celery Beat?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendants should have a basic knowledge of Python, and a minor development experience.&lt;/p&gt;
