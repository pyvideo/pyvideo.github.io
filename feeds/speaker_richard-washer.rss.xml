To bridge the gap between this (a notebook) and a successful product, you must own the user experience and work with product design and feature planning.
Sometimes you must go on an adventure back to being a junior, get some new tech off the shelf and work your way back to familiar territory. Learn how a JS developer with limited python experience worked through tooling and workflow planning choices to iterate to victory.
See how you can use python to work closely with product/UI designers to shape a reproducible product workflow and solve a user problem.
Ideal audience: People with any level of python experience who want to see how it can fit into the wider picture of product development in the trenches of a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
