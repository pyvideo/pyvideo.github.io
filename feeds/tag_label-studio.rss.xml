For example, GPT-3 was trained with data from &amp;quot;Common Crawl&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Web Text&amp;quot;, among other sources. As the saying goes — bigger isn't always better. While powerful, these data sets (and the models that they create) often come at a cost, bringing their &amp;quot;internet-scale biases&amp;quot; along with their &amp;quot;internet-trained models.&amp;quot; While powerful, these models beg the question — is unsupervised learning the best future for machine learning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ML researchers have developed new model-tuning techniques to address the known biases within existing models and improve their performance (as measured by response preference, truthfulness, toxicity, and result generalization). All of this at a fraction of the initial training cost. In this talk, we will explore these techniques, known as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and how open-source machine learning tools like PyTorch and Label Studio can be used to tune off-the-shelf models using direct human feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
