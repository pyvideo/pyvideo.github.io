themselves after searching a lot on the internet and without finding
what they were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will tell you what we used and how we used it, we will
also tell you how we made plans and then how we made circuits (timing,
requirements, how difficult and fun it was)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will finally tell you more about code and why exactly we wrote it
like that (Spoiler: there was a module with the RTC we used but the
memory of the trinket was to small to support the original code to do
what exactly we wanted to do)&lt;/p&gt;
