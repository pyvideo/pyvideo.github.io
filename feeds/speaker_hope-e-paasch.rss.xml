public information under both federal and state law, including how to
write the request, who to send it to and tactics for getting
compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy democracy depends on open information so that both the
public and officials can participate in making good decisions. But a
great deal of information is essentially hidden from public view, held
in government databases that regular citizens can’t access. Even the
public officials who have access are often not fully aware of what
their data might show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does a developer get access to that information, in hopes of
shedding light on how government does or does not serve the needs of
citizens?&lt;/p&gt;
