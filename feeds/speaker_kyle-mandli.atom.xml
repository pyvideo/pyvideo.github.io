researchers in geophysical fluid dynamics looking for ways to increase
the validity of shallow water modeling techniques without using a fully
three dimensional model which may be too costly for the domain size
being looked at. In this talk we will step through the effort needed to
convert a Fortran based solver to one using the PyClaw framework, a
Python framework targeted at the solution of hyperbolic conservation
laws. Once the application is converted the ease of implementing
parallel and other solver strategies is greatly simplified. Discussion
of how this is accomplished and design decisions and future extensions
to PyClaw will also be presented.&lt;/p&gt;
