As a Python
developer, you can be a part of the effort to turn that number around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, we’ll introduce you to the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG) and show you practical ways to incorporate
accessibility into your web development. We’ll build a blog website
using a Python-powered content management system called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wagtail.org"&gt;Wagtail&lt;/a&gt; and demonstrate how you can make your
project more accessible as you go. We’ll show you how to customize
Wagtail’s accessibility tools to continuously test and improve your
website accessibility over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To benefit the most from this tutorial, students should have at least
some basic knowledge of Python and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;. A laptop with Python 3.8 or
above installed on it is required to participate in the hands-on
exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
