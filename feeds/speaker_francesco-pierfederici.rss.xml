It has
been in operation non-stop since the mid 80s and is used to observe
24-hours a day, 365 days a year. All of the high-level telescope control
software, monitoring, data archiving as well as some of the data
processing software is written in Python. This choice, controversial at
first, proved to be extremely successful making the IRAM 30m telescope
extremely efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe how Python is used at the telescope, the reasons
behind these choices, lessons learned and future developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IRAM 30m radio telescope is one of the best in the world. The

and why Python is used at the telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Francesco Pierfederici (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe how Python is used in a large astronomy project to
automatically process data from several telescopes in both the
hemispheres. We introduce the general problem and discuss challenges and
lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;
