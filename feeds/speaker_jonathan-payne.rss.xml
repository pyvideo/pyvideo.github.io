&lt;p&gt;The international community and low income countries are using open source software to help solve some of the world's biggest health challenges, like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, even COVID-19. The Open Concept Lab (OCL) is an open source project that helps countries and organizations manage, publish, and use standard terminology, which is how an electronic medical record knows that &amp;quot;Complete Blood Count&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;CBC&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Full Hemogram&amp;quot; all mean the same thing. Getting this wrong could increase morbidity. But being able to use data, regardless of who, where, or how it was captured can save lives. OCL is part of the Open Health Information Exchange (OpenHIE) community, an online community dedicated to developing open software and standards improving the health of the underserved. Drop by if you want to geek out on terminology standards, open source python, and international development.&lt;/p&gt;
