Python app, free of charge, serverless, and infinitely scaling across
the globe. We will demonstrate some apps you can start building today on
Cloudflare’s full-featured developer platform, making use of robust
batteries-included integrations with Cloudflare database, object
storage, AI inference, and vector database solutions. Python Workers
also support a variety of packages such as Pandas, Pydantic, and
Fastapi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the demos, we will discuss some technical challenges we overcame
to make Pyodide, a Python runtime built for WebAssembly, work in the
Cloudflare Workers serverless runtime. Specifically, we will dive into
memory snapshots, FFI bindings, and stack switching.&lt;/p&gt;
