especially after the introduction of asyncio into the standard library
of the language. We’ve all seen the benchmarks that tell us how
asyncio-powered web servers massively outperform their non-asyncio
counterparts for trivial routes and we’ve seen the articles that tell us
how to make the move from flask to aiohttp and why we should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all of this, the question remains: How is it to use asyncio in a
production setting? What are the pain points of migrating a large
application to use asyncio? How does the performance of this real-world
application differ after the migration? Is it still just unicorns and
fairy tales? The goal of this talk is to address these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious about taking the step from asyncio-dabbling to
creating actual mission critical software systems in asyncio; this is
the talk for you!&lt;/p&gt;
