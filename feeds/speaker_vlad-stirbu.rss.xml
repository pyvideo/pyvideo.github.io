We used modern development practices and tools to document the code and
the APIs exposed by our microservices, but was that enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces the audience to the particularities of developing
medical device software and the regulatory landscape that you must
comply with. Iâ€™ll focus specifically on the processes and culture that
enables the creation of medical software device documentation intended
for auditors, without damaging (too much) the team velocity and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
