Unfortunately, the end point has to be the same for all students (pass the Standard!) and the time to get there is usually invariant.
This talk will cover my different experiences in teaching different genders and different socio-economic groups over a three year period in Auckland schools. The classes shared only a few things in common â€“ classes were after school, one day a week, I was there for a term and I had some help in the form of tutors from a local IT company. The interesting part is the ways in which the classes varied and as a consequence, how I had to adapt teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
