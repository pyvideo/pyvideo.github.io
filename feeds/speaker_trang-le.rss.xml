In this talk, I will share how I discovered the ultimate new hire hack by creating two small packages that gave me the confidence I needed when I started at BMS. Through building these packages, I not only learned R things like using bslib and making font files available for published dashboards, but also gained a deep understanding of my company's internal systems and workflows, and connected with my team via lots of questions. The resulting packages are still heavily used today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me to discover how small packages can have a broad impact and what hiring managers can do to help.&lt;/p&gt;
