Always meant to add tests to your project
but didn't know where to start? This presentation will provide a gentle
introduction to unit testing your module, package or entire project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard library comes with the unit test module but a great
alternative is py.test. Py.test makes starting to test your project as
easy as possible. When you need them it has a full set of tools and
testing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will provide an overview of unit testing and then show
how easy it is to get started using py.test.&lt;/p&gt;
