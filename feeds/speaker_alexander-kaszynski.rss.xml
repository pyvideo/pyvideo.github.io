our products. After evaluating two strategies, we chose the open source
and managed decentralized approach, which has now grown into a
company-scale project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will discuss our journey of transitioning from a
monolithic and centralized development approach to a decentralized
development process using common tools, including a common documentation
theme, GitHub actions, styling and automation. We will also delve into
how we balance developer autonomy with guardrails such as pre-commit,
auto-code formatting, and flake8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this journey, we learned that the fundamental problem is
never the technology; it's the culture. By embracing open source and
decentralization, we were able to unlock new levels of collaboration,
productivity, and innovation within our company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us for a thought-provoking presentation on how you can integrate
Python and open source into your closed source company and reap the
benefits of a more collaborative and productive development process.&lt;/p&gt;
