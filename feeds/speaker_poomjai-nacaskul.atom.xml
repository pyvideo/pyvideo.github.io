Much of 'Big Data' revolution has to do with dealing with non-traditional datatypes and feeding machine learning engines with non-numerical variables. Just as Convolutional Neural Networks excel at object recognition task precisely because the convolution layers expressly capture grid-array information embedded in the 2-dimensional visual field, analysis involving network-patterned objects (individuals in an online social network, transportation nodes, banking accounts with payment network, etc.) stands to benefit from the ability to extract graph-theoretic properties from the network connectivity patterns, either to provide insights in and of themselves, or as pre-processing to further machine learning task down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
