Tools
such as &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;docker&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;rkt&lt;/tt&gt; have made deployment of applications
using Linux containers easier, but they do not alone provide everything
that is needed to easily manage many applications, or run containers at
scale across a cluster of machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk you will learn about the fundamental concepts and
terminology of Kubernetes and why it is emerging as the de-facto
standard for container orchestration and scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will step through how to deploy to Kubernetes a Python web
application, implemented using Django, as a way of seeing what happens
under the covers when you do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics which will be covered to illustrate how Kubernetes works will
include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are containers and pods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessing pods for an application via a service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scaling up applications to many instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic recovery from application failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposing a web application to the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building images targeting Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application lifecycle management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring health of an application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security and controlling access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is a tool for IT operations. It implements what is regarded
as a Container as a Service (CaaS). You can use it to host an
application packaged up in a pre-existing application image, but does
not help you with building that image. In some respects Kubernetes can
be viewed as like the Linux kernel, you wouldnâ€™t try and deploy it
yourself from scratch, instead you would use a packaged distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will also touch on different Kubernetes distributions such as
vendor distributions from Heptio, and OpenShift from Red Hat, as well as
Kubernetes services such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon
Elastic Container Service (EKS) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Examples of how these distributions and service offerings around
Kubernetes bundle in additional functionality, including integrated
routing, metrics, logging and Platform as a Service (PaaS)
functionality, in order to provide a better developer centric experience
will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

Measured in Internet time, it is ancient. The oldest main stream implementation of the WSGI specification is mod_wsgi, for the Apache HTTPD server and it is over 10 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WSGI is starting to be regarded as not up to the job, with technologies such as HTTP/2, web sockets and async dispatching being the way forward. Reality is that WSGI will be around for quite some time yet and for the majority of use cases is more than adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real problem is not that we need to move to these new technologies, but that we aren't using the current WSGI servers to their best advantage. Moving to a new set of technologies will not necessarily make things better and will only create a new set of problems you have to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the oldest WSGI server implementations, Apache and mod_wsgi may be regarded as boring and not cool, but it is still the most stable option for hosting WSGI applications available. It also hasn't been sitting still, with a considerable amount of development work being done on mod_wsgi in the last few years to make it even more robust and easier to use in a development environment as well as production, including in containerised environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk you will learn about many features of mod_wsgi which you probably didn't even know existed, features which can help towards ensuring your Python web application deployment performs to its best, is secure, and has a low maintenance burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics which will be covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy deployment of Python web applications using mod_wsgi-express.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration of mod_wsgi-express with a Django web application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using mod_wsgi-express in a development environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make use of mod_wsgi-express in a production environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using mod_wsgi-express in a containerised runtime environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring consistency between development and production environments using warpdrive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using mod_wsgi-express to bootstrap a system Apache installation for hosting WSGI applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why you should be using daemon mode of mod_wsgi and not embedded mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to properly associate mod_wsgi with a Python virtual environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a robust deployment that can recover from misbehaving application code, backend services, or request overloading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using hooks provided by mod_wsgi to monitor the performance of your Python web application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a beginner, come learn why mod_wsgi is still a good option for deploying your Python web applications. If you are an old time user of mod_wsgi, find out about all the features you probably didn't know existed, revisit your current Python web application deployment and make it even better.&lt;/p&gt;

Deploying Python web applications is too hard. You either have to understand some arcane configuration syntax, or have to dig through an encyclopaedic volume of options. It shouldn't have to be this hard. In this talk you will see how 'warpdrive', with the right sort of magic, can make Python web application deployment easy.&lt;/p&gt;

Python is a dynamic programming language and has a strong tradition of adhering to a programming style called duck-typing. This means that it is possible to easily modify an application's code while it is running. One might wish to do this for various reasons, including enhancing the functionality of code, correcting errant behaviour, or adding instrumentation or debugging code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making such code modifications can be tricky though and not done correctly can potentially interfere with the operation of the original code, through destroying introspection abilities, not honouring the duck-typing mantra or due to being applied at the wrong time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do need to do monkey patching though, the 'wrapt' library is your friend, with its transparent object proxy wrappers and post import hook mechanism, it allows you to safely monkey patch code to modify its behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come learn about the 'wrapt' library and the joys, but also the dangers, of monkey patching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session will cover the challenges of creating a production
application performance monitoring system for Python. It includes an
overview of the architecture of the system, as well as how it hooks into
Django and captures details about web transactions, database
transactions, memcache requests, exceptions and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

Implementing
decorators which will work in a range of contexts is however non
trivial. This talk will walk through various problems which arise with
the more common ways of implementing decorators and then describe how to
combine a wrapper and a descriptor to build a better decorator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#64; Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Sunday, 08 Sep 2013 - Track 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experienced&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decorator is any callable Python object that is used to modify a
function, method or class definition. A decorator is passed the original
object being defined and returns a modified object, which is then bound
to the name in the definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would generally expect the result of applying a decorator to an
object to be another object which is not readily distinguishable from
the original. Naive implementations of decorators do not however
preserve introspectability. This can result in callable objects having
different names, appearing to have different signatures or not returning
the original doc strings. This can cause problems for tools where you
want to derive information about the original wrapped object such as
debuggers, IDEs, documentation systems or performance monitoring
software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the functools.wraps() decorator addresses some of these
issues, but relies on decorators being implemented as closures. Using a
closure to implement a decorator will not always work when wrapping
functions where the descriptor protocol needs to be triggered to bind a
function to an instance, to create an instance method, or where the
function is a special method type such as a class method or static
method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more robust decorator, and one where the decorator is able to
distinguish when it is being applied to a normal function or instance
method, needs to be implemented as a combination of a wrapper and a
descriptor. To also be able to use this as a generic wrapper when
performing monkey patching requires even more tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this talk is to walk through the various problems which
arise with the more common ways of implementing decorators. It will then
describe how to create a more robust generic wrapper/decorator which can
be used in a wider range of scenarios than typical decorators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A benchmark of a hello world application is often what developers use to
make the all important decision of what web hosting infrastructure they
use. Worse is that in many cases this is the only sort of performance
testing or monitoring they will ever do. When it comes to their
production applications they are usually flying blind and have no idea
of how it is performing and what they need to do to tune their web
application stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide an overview as to where in your overall request
handling pipeline the main overheads are going to arise. It will then
zoom in and discuss different limiting factors or bottlenecks which can
arise within your WSGI server stack and system that can directly affect
the performance of your Python web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such factors that will be discussed will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of threads vs processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of processors available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python global interpreter lock (GIL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amount of memory available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow HTTP browsers/clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser keep alive connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to handle static assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this will be provided some general guidelines of what is a good
configuration/architecture to use for different types of Python web
applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of continuous production monitoring will also be covered,
ensuring that you know when the performance of your system is dropping
off due to changing traffic patterns as well as code changes you have
made in your actual web application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring tools will record the result of what happened to your web
application or system when a problem arises, but for some classes of
problem are of limited help in working out what happened, except through
inference or by way of anecdotal evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe the limitations on what monitoring tools can
help you with. It will then move onto look at a range of debugging tools
and techniques which can be applied to web applications, but also
separate them into what can and cannot be used on live production web
applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics which will be discussed will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser viewable error pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser based debuggers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python interactive debuggers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-mortem exception analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods for dumping Python stack traces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods for dumping C stack traces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods for analysing thread utilisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactive process introspection tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error reporting and logging services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance monitoring services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

can be hard. Information from log messages and details of any Python
exceptions which occurred, along with other application performance data
can help to identify the issue, but not always. Often you will need to
fall back to a development or test environment and hope you can
replicate the problem and then debug the issue from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this talk is to dive in and look at one class of tools
that can be used in helping debug web applications. Specifically, it
will look at web application tools such as the Django debug tool bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than simply look at how you might use such a tool though, this
talk will look at how these debug tool bars are actually implemented,
how they hook into your web application, how they capture the
information that they do, as well as how they can be extended to add new
functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations on these tools as far as performance overhead, security
of data etc, which nearly aways lead to them only being recommended for
development environments, will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time though, this notion that they are only suitable for
development environments will also be challenged by looking at how a
tool such as the New Relic Python agent, which implements application
performance monitoring, overcomes such limitations to provide a
production grade solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there lessons to be learnt from how the New Relic Python agent works
which could drive improvements to existing web application debug tool
bars? Could the New Relic Python agent itself be used as a base for a
new generation of debug tool bars which combine an ability to debug a
web application, even in a production environment, with the ability to
monitor the performance of the web application over time?&lt;/p&gt;

development web server provided by the web framework is often what is
used. When moving to a production environment, one has to choose a more
capable production grade WSGI deployment mechanism. Which of the various
WSGI servers available is going to be the most suitable is going to
depend on a range of criteria related to your specific web applications
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, rather than look at the bigger picture and what would be
the most suitable across such criteria, many people will simply rush to
trying to run an overly simplistic benchmark on the various WSGI servers
and make the decision based purely on perceptions of whether one WSGI
server is faster than the alternatives. Worse, they don't even attempt
to do the benchmarks themselves and instead rely on benchmarks published
on some public blog site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such public benchmarks as are available are often flawed, or cover such
a narrow use case as to in no way be relevant to that users own specific
situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further problem with such benchmarks is that they try and evaluate the
performance of a WSGI server as if they are a black box. As such, there
is no attempt to try and work out what is actually going on within the
WSGI server and why it is exhibiting the behaviour it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this talk is to explore a number of different micro
benchmarks, using them to work out what is actually going on within a
WSGI server when they are run. The analysis will delve down into, and
look at the different ways that WSGI servers are implemented and
deployed. The behaviour under the different benchmarks will be
determined using fine grained metrics captured from hooking
instrumentation into the WSGI servers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As there are many factors which could be investigated, the talk cannot
be entirely comprehensive, but selected benchmarks drawing from a sub
set of the following areas will be presented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multithreading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU intensive tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long running requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combination of short and long running requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;large request content uploads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;large amounts of response content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking on back end services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slow HTTP clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tests will look not just at response times, but also server capacity
utilisation, CPU and memory utilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the discussion will primarily revolve around WSGI servers, a
comparison will also be made for some tests were one instead to use an
ASYNC web application framework alone, or in conjunction with a WSGI
adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, an attempt will be made to summarise what you should be
looking at in a WSGI server to determine if it is the right choice for
your use case.&lt;/p&gt;

servers. Reality is that they often have no idea what they are doing or
what to look at. This talk will look at a range of factors which can
influence the performance of your Python web application. This includes
the impact of using threads vs processes, number of processors, memory
available, the GIL and slow HTTP clients.&lt;/p&gt;

for running Python web applications. Is there a valid basis to such
claims or have they simply been misguided by the views of others? This
talk will endeavor to shine a light on the realities of and limitations
in working with Apache, as well as the challenges in implementing the
mod_wsgi module for Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
