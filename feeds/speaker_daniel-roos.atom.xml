This talk dives into 'why?'. First looking at several areas where Python is big, what kind of work is involved, and the challenges for developers? Then at what libraries/language aspects make Python particularly suited. Pandas gets particular attention as it is incredibly useful and can make you super productive. We finish up with a demo of how you can use Monte Carlo techniques to build a mini stock market simulation and test out your own trading ideas. After the talk, you should have a better feel for what it's like working with Python in finance and also a good set of starting point if you want to start experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;
