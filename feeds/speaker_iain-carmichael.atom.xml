Can we determine
which are the most the most influential cases in our legal system? Can
we understand how legal doctrine evolves? Using tools from network
statistics and data provided by Court Listener (an open legal data
project), we analyze the network of law case citations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citation networks have recently been a topic of interest to network
scientists. Court Listener, an open data initiative, provides the
network of law case citations as well as the text of (almost every)
court case in the US. This network data set provides a rich array of
questions that are of interest to legal scholars as well as network
scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we determine which cases are the most influential in our legal
system? Can we understand how legal doctrine evolves? We will discuss
what we learned about how the network of law cases evolves and what
this means for legal practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by this data set we develop new statistical methodology to
model how networks evolve. We also provide new techniques to asses the
goodness of fit for both standard and novel probabilistic network
growth models.&lt;/p&gt;
