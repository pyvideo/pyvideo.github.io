AwkwardArray, boost-histogram/hist, and iMinuit are examples of libraries that are used beyond the original HEP focus. In this talk, we will look key packages in the ecosystem, at how the collection of 30+ packages was developed and maintained, and the software ecosystem contributions made to packages like cibuildwheel, pybind11, nox, scikit-build, build, and pipx that support this effort, and the Scikit-HEP developer pages, and initial WebAssembly support.&lt;/p&gt;
