assigned (harried and inaccessible subject matter experts, barely
functioning builds, sketchy doc infrastructure, etc.). But there are
also the obstacles that keep us from writing the docs we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;, and
those are largely ingrained in our companies' processes and our own
heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pay lip service to &amp;quot;the user&amp;quot; but then subordinate that to concerns
of structure, consistency, and stylistic conventions. The result is
often docs that are internally consistent and satisfy the editorial,
translation, and production teams for their economy and re-usability but
are so dry and product-centered that they fail to connect with the most
important audience - actual human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I'll talk about ways to overcome burdensome
organizational processes and our own timidity to create room for the
inspiration and creativity needed to bring the docs' subject alive.&lt;/p&gt;
