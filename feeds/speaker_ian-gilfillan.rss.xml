current development release. This talk introduces some of the new
features that may be of interest to Python developers, in particular
Window Functions and Common Table Expressions (CTEs). Window
functions are similar to aggregate functions in that they perform
calculations across a set of rows. Recursive CTEs are excellent for
navigating a tree structure, or a route map, which regular SQL is
poor at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making use of these features. more work can be passed on to the
database layer, simplifying the code and improving performance.&lt;/p&gt;
