Using these markers, we can diagnose the most difficult of runtime issues with unprecedented access to the running state of the application, in particular allowing SysAdmins/DevOps/Production Engineers to better understand why a particular application is misbehaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll explain what these probes are, how it works and provide examples as to how you can leverage the SystemTap and BPF interface to debug some of the more complex systems. I will cover when these tools are the right thing to use and give insight to when you should be using something different and more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
