She will discuss the background of GDPR in terms of data privacy, the core points and key definitions in the regulation, the list of steps companies need to take and show some examples of what the industry is doing to prepare for the May 25th implementation date. She hopes that audience members will walk away from the keynote with a better understanding of the GDPR and how it can affect them and their companies – as well as gain insights on how their day to day work can be impacted by the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

Neural networks have millions of parameters and provide no uncertainty. In this talk, we solve both problems with one simple trick: Bayesian deep learning. We show how to prune 90% of the parameters while maintaining performance. As a bonus, we get the uncertainty over our predictions, which is useful for critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Their focus is often on making it as simple as possible for a (Python) data scientist. Shipp ing them as part of our product means that other roles like frontend developers get involved. Aspects that ease development for one role, create pains for oth ers. We want to show how balance this using Altair, Vega and Vue.&lt;/p&gt;

But there's other models which could also break down a seasonal series into trend, seasonality and noise. We will use an open source Python library called Seasonal to analyse B2B worldwide travel data.&lt;/p&gt;

But as they usually operate as in-memory engines, they can be hard to scale. In my talk, I'd like to outline several ways one can scale their compute platform to handle larger datasets without incurring much cost.&lt;/p&gt;

But beyond the slow, deliberative process of adding features to the core language, what is the value of hacking your interpreter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents a practical example of dynamic code instrumentation using hacked interpreters.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s time-consuming, brittle, and often unrewarding. Not only that, it’s hard to operate, evolve, and troubleshoot. As ETL pipelines grow in complexity, and as data teams grow in numbers, using methodologies that provide clarity isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

But how do we design a machine learning algorithm for this use case and in what ways can we improve it? In this talk, we start with a simple linear model, evolving to increasingly complex deep learning neural network architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, we’ll tackle the challenge of predicting which patients are likely to respond to given anti-cancer treatments. In doing so, we’ll show how tools such as Snakemake/Bioconda can be used to create reproducible workflows and illustrate the challenges of interpreting predictive models in large, highly-correlated feature spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

And next to handling a lot of plants and flowers, we also handle a lot of pictures of plants and flowers. Pictures that need to be of a certain quality. We built a fully automized self-improving system to check the image quality by using deep learning models, asynchronous API technologies and Docker/AWS/Gitlab.&lt;/p&gt;

In this tutorial we focus on the capabilities of structured streaming in Apache Spark, for building so-called continuous applications in the cloud. Microsoft Azure is used as the running platform.&lt;/p&gt;

But, are we putting all of it to good use? Gorjan, a 25 year old software engineer, uses open data and a mobile app to lead a 3000 strong community of eco-activists in his home country of Macedonia, with the goal of saving 2.000.000 of his fellow citizens from a horrific air pollution problem.&lt;/p&gt;

I will share some technical examples in recent developments (for example Bayesian Neural Networks using Edward) but more importantly I hope to trigger the audience to start thinking strategically about how we want our machine learning models to learn from new data.&lt;/p&gt;

In this workshop, we will learn some tips and tricks to deal with messy text data, before moving on to some lesser looked at text analysis techniques, such as text summarization, working with distance metrics, and an old personal favorite - topic models.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, we'll explore what is unique about unit testing data, and see how Two Sigma's open source library Marbles addresses these unique challenges in several real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

Why is that? How do you approach such problems and how to make this a success? Where do you get the privacy-sensitive data from? Do pre-trained networks work? Can we make it scalable in the cloud? I will address these issues with a case study: segmentation of 4D heart MRI for heart function analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

But despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction. We will use eli5 and the LIME algorithm to explain text classifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

The main elements of our strategy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A model predicting the probability of churning for each customer in a given timeframe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimentation framework to incentivize customers based on the churn model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
