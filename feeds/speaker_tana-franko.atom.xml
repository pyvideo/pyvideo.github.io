The hectic pace of documentarian tasks is only accelerating these days, spurred on by things like continuous deployment and tools that enable a new, higher level of collaboration. These changes bring not only unprecedented opportunities but also unprecedented challenges.
Today&amp;amp;#39;s technical communicators need to adapt to cope with this change. In this talk, Tina the Tech Writer is back, now leading a team of writers. The team has been almost too successful at proving the value of documentation. Facing a mountain of urgent requests for documentation coverage, potential writer burnout, and attrition, she puts her hedgehog brain skills to practical application on a plan to bring the team to new levels of engagement, happiness, and value -- all while learning to say no when appropriate. It&amp;amp;#39;s all about balance. Tina will share results from her team&amp;amp;#39;s experiment, while outlining a way you can design your own plan to balance any set of challenges and opportunities you&amp;amp;#39;re facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;amp;quot;People who hope to thrive in the Conceptual Age must understand the connections between diverse, and seemingly separate, disciplines.&amp;amp;quot; So says Daniel Pink in his book, A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future. In this talk, I assert that tech writers are a natural fit to help their organizations transition from the Information Age to the Conceptual Age. I&amp;amp;#39;ll also give and seek ideas on how we as writers can apply Pink&amp;amp;#39;s six aptitudes -- storytelling, empathy, design, humor, games, and finding meaning -- to make our work more fulfilling, if not more competitive.
The key underlying message for those who attend this talk is: YOU are a designer. Even if you haven&amp;amp;#39;t traditionally seen yourself in this role, writers are information designers who serve a unique, user-focused and holistic function on development teams. By recognizing that fact, and opening up space in your work life for creativity, you can have an even bigger impact and a more fulfilling career.&lt;/p&gt;
