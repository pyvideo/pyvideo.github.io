&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Pumping Station: One (Chicago's Hackerspace) people often send
messages to the mailing list or ask on IRC if anyone is at the space or
plans to be later. There's an opportunity there to solve problems
automatically rather than through human input. Member Eric Stein
designed a Python / OpenCV based application (lidless) to monitor four
video cameras in the space and offer a REST API, a web front end with
historical graphs, and an IRC bot in the IRC channel to relay
information about how busy the space is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is a short demo of the application accompanied by motivations
and high level archtechture breakdown. Following the demo/archtechture
I'll dive into the parts of the code that people are most interested in
hearing about with Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;
