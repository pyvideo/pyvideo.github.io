&lt;p&gt;Yoon Soo-jin
I am Yoon Soo-jin, a first-year junior developer who loves Python. I am currently developing using Python and Django at the animation streaming company ‘Raftel’. I started developing relatively late, but I got so absorbed in it that I thought I should bury my bones in this field. There is so much to learn as I develop, so every day is happy. When I open my eyes in the morning, I wonder and look forward to what new things I will learn today. I am from 42Seoul, and I like the saying, ‘If you go alone, you will go fast, but if you go together, you will go long.’ I want to become a developer who goes together and for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
