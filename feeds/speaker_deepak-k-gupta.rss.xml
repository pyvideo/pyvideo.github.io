&lt;blockquote&gt;
This tutorial will not make you an expert in Machine Learning but
will cover enough things to acquaint, enable and empower you to
understand, explore and exploits the concept and idea behind it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We'll be learning by generating our own data with bare minimal data
points (5 - 10) so that we can manually verify our machine learning
algorithms to understand it better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This will also help us to see how changes in data can impact our
Machine Learning Algorithms. At the end of this tutorial, we'll also be
using one real-world Dataset and play with it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this tutorial, I'll be covering at least 3 well-known ML
algorithms(KNN, Linear and Logistic Regression) along with all the maths
behind it. We'll end the tutorial with a real-world mapping application&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no major prerequisite for attending this, you just need to
know the basics of python language and I'll cover the rest. We'll be
using Scikit Learn for simplicity purpose, again, you don't need to have
any prior experience with Scikit Learn or for that matter with Machine
Learning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
