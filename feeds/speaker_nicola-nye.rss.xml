To do this, you need information from other
people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that they're too busy, or in another office, or another timezone,
or they just don't want to help. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will look at the psychology behind why we often don't get the
help we ask for, how we can work with what we've got, and ways we can
get information out of unwilling participants, in spite of themselves!&lt;/p&gt;
