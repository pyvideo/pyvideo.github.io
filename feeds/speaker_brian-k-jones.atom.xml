some common, simple patterns in code, and the testing patterns that go
with them. We'll also discover what makes some code more testable than
others, and how mocks and fakes can help isolate the code to be tested
(and why you want to do that). Finally, we'll touch on some tools to
help make writing and running tests easier.&lt;/p&gt;

It can
actually be fun and interesting, and it's an enormous benefit to the
community. This talk makes the case that writing is our civic duty to
our community, and gives some tips to get started writing for various
different venues &amp;amp; audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
