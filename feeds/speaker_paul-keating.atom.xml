answered a question on StackOverflow, will know that reading error
messages is a skill that beginners have to learn. It is less widely
appreciated that writing good error messages is also a skill that must
be learnt. This talk is in two parts. The first covers the commonest
error message gaffes: • Insufficiently explicit messages. • Issuing the
same message for two different conditions. • Suppressing the stack
trace. • Polluting the stack trace. The second part describes a way to
ensure usable, actionable error messages, even when the writer of the
message is not a professional coder. This was developed for an
environment where superusers code up most of the dozens of data
validation rules and the accompanying messages, and the application in
which Python is embedded suppresses the stack trace.&lt;/p&gt;
