These models, coupled with innovative ideas, revolutionize how we build applications. However, for software developers, entering the field of NLP can be overwhelming because of all new NLP concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haystack is an open-source Python framework designed to empower developers in building LLM applications using the latest language models and state-of-the-art NLP approaches by providing all the tools you need. Haystack's composable pipeline system and LLM-based building components open up a world of possibilities, enabling generative question answering, document retrieval, chatbots, and much more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll begin with a high-level overview of key NLP concepts, including vector databases, document preprocessing, word embeddings, LLMs, and prompting. This will lay the groundwork for understanding the core concepts required to develop applications powered by LLMs. Once we've explored these fundamental concepts, we’ll combine them together to create a generative question-answering application tailored for custom documents using Haystack. By end of this talk, you'll have a solid grasp of NLP basics and learn how to use it for your needs in your applications.&lt;/p&gt;
