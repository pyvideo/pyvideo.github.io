In this talk, I will walk through how to
build essential docs for an early stage startup that lays a strong
foundation for continuous improvement and expansion. The story will be
told through my experiences building docs from scratch for CockroachDB
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com"&gt;https://www.cockroachlabs.com&lt;/a&gt;), a next-generation open source database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined Cockroach Labs as its first technical writer, CockroachDB
had been in development for nearly two years and had 15 engineers and
60+ open source developers contributing to it. I needed to build a
documentation structure and process that would be lightweight enough for
developers to contribute to and flexible enough to apply to the product
(and team) years down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will walk the audience through the process of learning a new
product and development team, and allowing that information to guide the
information architecture and tool selection process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics will include: - How do you learn a new product, and why is it
essential to understand its market fit? - How do you learn about your
users - who are they, what are their primary pain points, and what do
they need most from docs? - How do you choose tools and workflows for
building your initial docs architecture? - How do you iterate on,
improve, and expand your docs, and harness contributors to do the same?&lt;/p&gt;
