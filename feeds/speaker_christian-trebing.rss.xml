you? I thought so also. But when playing around with that topic for
some time, I realized that it sheds a different light on many topics
I struggled with for some time. In this talk I want to share with you
what I discovered when switching from a from a database centric view
to stream oriented processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splitting your application in smaller services gets easier as you
have more natural boundaries. You have more options to run different
data schema versions in different services (instead of one central db
upgrade). More scaling possibilities. Operations improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, streaming does not solve any problem, but much more than I
thought before. And in python you have good support with many
streaming clients. I will give some examples and comparisons for
working with Kafka and Avro Schemas.&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Blue Yonder, we've built a platform that can accept and process
bulk amounts of data for multiple business domains (e.g. handling
retail store location and sales data) using SQLAlchemy as a database
abstraction layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to use as much of SQLAlchemy as possible, but we quickly
found that the ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is not suitable for
handling large amounts of data at once. At the same time, we did not
want each team of developers working on individual business domains to
have to handcraft their own SQL statements. To solve this problem, we
built an application configuration that closely resembles an
SQLAlchemy model, but also contains application-specific logic
settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will demonstrate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An application architecture for multiple business domains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The structure of the domain configuration utilized in the generation of the SQLAlchemy model, SQLAlchemy core statements, and other application functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the domain configuration is used throughout the application (consuming and parsing incoming data, storing it in a database and ensuring data quality)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airflow (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/airbnb/airflow"&gt;https://github.com/airbnb/airflow&lt;/a&gt;) is an open source Python
package from Airbnb to control your workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain the concepts behind Airflow, demonstrating how
to define your own workflows in Python code and how to extend the
functionality with new task operators and UI blueprints by developing
your own plugins. You'll also get to hear about our experiences at
Blue Yonder,  using this tool in real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you work with data, sooner or later you stumble across the
definition of your workflows. At what point should you process your
customer's data? What subsequent steps are necessary? And what went
wrong with your data processing last Saturday night?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Blue Yonder we use Airflow (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/airbnb/airflow"&gt;https://github.com/airbnb/airflow&lt;/a&gt;), an
open source Python package from Airbnb to solve these problems. It can
be extended with new functionality by developing plugins in Python,
without the need to fork the repo. With Airflow, we define workflows
as directed acyclic graphs and get a shiny UI for free. Airflow comes
with some task operators which can be used out of the box to complete
certain tasks. For more specific cases, tasks can be developed by the
end user. Best of all: even the configuration is done completely in
Python!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain the concepts behind Airflow, demonstrating how
to define your own workflows in Python code and how to extend the
functionality with new task operators and UI blueprints. You'll also

scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
