&lt;p&gt;I'm a web developer at the Planetary Rings Node, part of the NASA
Planetary Data System. Our tiny shop is devoted to archiving,
cataloging, and distributing scientific data sets relevant to planetary
ring systems. Our base of operations is the SETI Institute, where a
research community is busy searching for and studying life in the
universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Rings Node I develop and maintain an outer planets space mission
data search tool called OPUS which is built with Django. It lets users
search data, browse images, and access its API via http. I'll talk about
some of the reasons for OPUS, some of the challenges we faced in
building it out and porting it - from a hot mess of php - to what it is
today, and I'll talk a little about our plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we'll see some pretty pictures of the outer planets. :-D&lt;/p&gt;
