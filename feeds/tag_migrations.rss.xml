applications from the community. I will highlight some of the best
applications that the Django/Python community has put together, talk
about places that are lacking, and talk about what these popular
applications have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written a series of blog posts about &amp;quot;Large problems&amp;quot; in the
community, and how they have been solved by members of our community
with reusable apps. Previously I have covered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delayed Execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database Migrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will update my thoughts on these issues, as well as talking about a
couple of other new issues that I think that have been solved in a
decent way. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote Command Execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging in Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this part I will highlight issues that are still headaches for the
Community. These are places where there is a good chance for growth for
third party apps, and places where I have personally found some friction
in my development. A couple examples of this are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class Based Views / Thread Safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging Production Environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above applications that are well done, what makes a popular
reusable app? This won't be my thoughts, but more looking at apps that
have been successful and trying to see what they have in common. A good
app and a good reusable app are necessarily different, and I think it
will be interesting to look at what traits make reusable apps popular.&lt;/p&gt;

one excels, why NoSQL isn't always best, and the best ways to integrate
them into your Django project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few years we've seen an explosion in the number of
production- ready databases available for web applications. From
relational to document- oriented, key-value and more, there's a
staggering array of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers the various basic types of database now available, and
highlights their weaknesses, their strengths, and the features you just
can't get from traditional databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, after a short rant about the term &amp;quot;NoSQL&amp;quot;, learn how to best
integrate them into your Django projects, why being schemaless isn't as
good as it looks at first, and how relational databases are keeping up
with the times.&lt;/p&gt;
