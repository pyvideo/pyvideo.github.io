object---specifically, a 4-dimensional fractal &amp;quot;dust&amp;quot; that has been the
subject of mathematical research in hyperbolic geometry since the 1980s.
In the end this is accomplished using a little algebra, a little
geometry, and a healthy dose of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, I will present a case study of using Python in several aspects
of a mathematical visualization project, from the computation itself, to
transforming and converting data, and finally for scripting the process
of generating the images. Along the way I'll explain how Python's
convenient idioms and containers (e.g. sets and set comprehensions) are
a good fit for some of the algebraic and geometric questions that come
up, how Scipy and Numpy enable fast numerical calculations, and how
Python's strength as a language for scripting and automation allows easy
orchestration of rendering of still images and frames of animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mathematical visualization project we describe is a collaboration
with François Guéritaud (Université de Lille).&lt;/p&gt;
