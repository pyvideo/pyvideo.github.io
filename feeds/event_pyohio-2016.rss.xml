Most often, these annotations are used for type checking or type casting. I'll talk through examples of each, including &lt;cite&gt;typing&lt;/cite&gt; from the Python 3.5 standard library and the &lt;cite&gt;mypy&lt;/cite&gt; static type checker. This talk expects basic knowledge of Python but no experience with function annotations is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

Then once an API is made public it can be hard to change. Let's discuss how we can improve this process by explicitly designing the API contract and getting client feedback before implementation. We will examine the process which promotes building HTTP APIs with a design first approach.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's explore the testing world with a gentle introduction to unittest, py.test, mock, gabbi, and betamax. We'll learn how to isolate our tests from databases, APIs and third party libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will introduce the basics of managing servers with Python using Fabric and Ansible. I will give a brief background on the theory of infrastructure automation, an overview of Fabric and Ansible, and show an outline of a complete system.&lt;/p&gt;

Python developers should treat logging with the same weight that we take unit tests. Logs can be just as important as test coverage for unearthing breaking changes in code. This talk will introduce the concept of logging, its use cases, and how to set up a custom log formatter you can tailor to your application's specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

They are perfect for a beginning programmer looking to build something cool, but open ended enough to hold the interest of an experienced developer. In this talk we'll go over the Python tools for building a great twitter bot, including where to find fun data sets, hosting your bot, delayed jobs, and examples of weird and wonderful bots.&lt;/p&gt;

This check includes passing various types, such as int, float, lists, and dictionaries, into the shared object file function, and checking what we can and cannot return from the shared object function.&lt;/p&gt;
