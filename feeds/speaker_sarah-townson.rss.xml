&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Over the summer, Science Oxford (and educational charity) ran an
IET/IMechE- funded robotics holiday club for 11-15 year olds living in
areas of high socio-economic deprivation in Oxford.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Throughout the week, participants learnt to program a BBC micro:bit in
Python, then designed and built their own robot to follow a winding
path, by choosing from a range of sensors. We also took them to visit
local organisations to show the range of opportunities available
within engineering, and the different routes to a career.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Hear about the problems we overcame to get this project off the
ground, our successes and failures, what the young people thought
about and gained from the week, and how we plan to improve it for next
year!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
