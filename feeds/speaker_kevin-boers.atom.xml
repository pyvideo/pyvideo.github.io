application is typically an evolutionary process. You experiment and
find things that work, and things that don't, particularly if you have
little programming experience. Sometimes, you proceed down a path that
binds your hands later down the road, and a massive refactor is needed.
I would like to present a simple testing framework built upon several
existing, free technologies (ConfigObj, twill, nose) and models (Page
Objects, Scenario Objects, Abstract State Machines) that is easy to
configure, extend, and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
