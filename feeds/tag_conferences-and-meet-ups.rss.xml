Foundation and the global Python community welcome and encourage
participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect,
tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live
up to these principles. We want our community to be more diverse:
whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversity, big deal! As an active members and event organisers (and also
on the minority side of the gender) in the Python community, we have
alway been concern by the question of: Do we truly have a problem in
diversity? Especially, gender diversity. We would like to find out the
truth, by data science, and see if we can find a clue why and how we can
fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we will show the research others did regarding the representation
of women in the R and Python communities [1]. Then, we will show the
research that we did based on our experience and statistic. Including
static analysis of the speakers diversity (regarding gender) at major
PyCon and PyData conferences. Finally, as we all care about diversity
and want improvements, we would like to find out the reason and what we
can do about it. We would propose what we, the minorities and allies,
could do against this seemingly unbalance situation and make the
community better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for all that who cares about diversity in our community.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's find out..!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best aspects of any conference, and EuroPython in particular, is the corridor track. It's when you walk around the physical conference venue and bump into an old buddy, find yourself striking up a conversation with a friendly co-attendee in the coffee queue, or join a huddle of welcoming folks discussing something interesting. The corridor track is where the community comes alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we remotely recreate the opportunity for chance encounters, unexpected conversation and exploration of a venue and new city with friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have a template for a solution: MUDs (multi-user dungeons/dimensions), back in the day, were hugely popular virtual worlds of text. I asked myself, &amp;quot;what would a MUD written in 2020 look like?&amp;quot;. Then, rather foolishly, &amp;quot;how hard can this be?&amp;quot;. Happily, I'd written a MUD in Python as a recent entry to PyWeek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk describes how I initially created, extended and then refined my very own MUD, written in Python using asyncio, structlog, sly, redis and other fun technology. What's more, this MUD is special because it's a programmable MUD: it's really a multi-user development platform for on-the-fly coding of interactive virtual worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could possibly go wrong..? Let's find out..!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python communities around the world, large and small are facing loss - from the loss of in person meetups and conferences to the loss of employment and even the potential loss of health and life. As communities we are all confronting uncertainty and unanswered questions. In this talk I would like to reflect on some of those questions. What are communities doing now to preserve a sense of community in the face of this crisis? What might we do and what options will we have for coming events? How can we build and foster community and still keep everyone safe? What challenges might we all face in the future? What sources of support can we find? What are our sources of optimism and hope?&lt;/p&gt;

PyCon Italia 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python has become very important for many of us - as the basis for
making a living, as a way to enjoy programming, or to bring people
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to take you on a tour through my two decades of community work
and hopefully inspire some of you to contribute to the community as
well. Python has become a very important part of life for many of us -
as the basis for making a living, as a way to enjoy programming, or as a
project which brings together people. I’ve had the opportunity to work
in all these fields in the last two decades and have learned a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I’d like to take you on a tour, share some of the insights
I have gained and hopefully inspire some of you to contribute to the
community as well.&lt;/p&gt;
