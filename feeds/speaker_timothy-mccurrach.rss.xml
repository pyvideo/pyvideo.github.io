If you've ever wondered where the &lt;cite&gt;request&lt;/cite&gt; object comes from? How the middleware-chain is put together? Or just what all those functions you see in your exception tracebacks do? Then join me in a deep dive of everything between the server, the view and back again, as we answer these questions and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be a look under the hood at Django's request handlers, middleware-chain and URL-resolvers. Focusing on just the WSGI route (not asynchronous), it aims to be accessible to beginners, but with the intention that a more experienced user will learn something new or interesting as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start off by replacing Django's &lt;cite&gt;WSGIHandler&lt;/cite&gt; with our own &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot; WSGI application. We'll then build back in additional features until it starts to resemble what we originally had. Along the way, we'll highlight lesser-known features, and give examples demonstrating how understanding the implementation will enable you to better take advantage of the features Django offers, and ultimately write better code.&lt;/p&gt;
