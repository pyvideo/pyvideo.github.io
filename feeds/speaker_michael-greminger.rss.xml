Pyodide runs in all modern web browsers at near native speeds and provides a means to allow users to run Python code without having to install anything. This Talk will go over a case study of porting a design optimization tool that I use in my university class to Pyodide. Iâ€™ll cover some of the implementation details and how the JavaScript user interface code interfaces with the data science code written in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
