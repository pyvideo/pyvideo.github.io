&lt;p&gt;By Steven Kolawole&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think about building Python-based data science apps, we think of Flask. But there is a better option now. Streamlit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streamlit is an open-source web framework that lets you create apps for your machine learning projects with deceptively simple Python scripts, in hours. It supports hot-reloading, so your app updates live as you edit and save your file. No need to mess with HTTP requests, HTML, JavaScript, etc. In a short sentence, there is no need to write any front-end code. All you need is your favorite editor and a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll go through how to build a very simple Streamlit app step-by-step. I will also review the pros and cons of Streamlit, as regards other popular Python web frameworks being used by Data Scientists and ML Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I elaborate on why we should develop tools that will allow us to build pre-trained models in the same way that we build open-source software. Specifically, models should be developed by a large community of stakeholders who continually update and improve them. Realizing this goal will require porting many ideas from open-source software development to building and training models, which motivates many threads of interesting research and opens up machine learning research for much larger participation.&lt;/p&gt;

It was fun. And it was stressful too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’d talk about the highs and lows of working on this project while also elaborating on the groundwork, the process, the results, and the future scope of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
