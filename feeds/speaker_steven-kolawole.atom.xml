&lt;p&gt;Track: PyData: Computer Vision
Building an E2E working prototype that detects sign language meanings in images/videos and generates equivalent, realistic voice of words communicated by the sign language, in real-time, won't be completed in a day's work. Here I'd explain how it happened and what I learned in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded at the PyConDE &amp;amp; PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.

When we think about building Python-based data science apps, we think Flask. But there is a better option now. Streamlit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streamlit is an open-source web framework that lets you create apps for your machine learning projects with deceptively simple Python scripts, in hours. It supports hot-reloading, so your app updates live as you edit and save your file. No need to mess with HTTP requests, HTML, JavaScript, etc. In a short sentence, there is no need to write any front-end code. All you need is your favorite editor and a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll go through how to build a very simple Streamlit app step-by-step. I will also review the pros and cons of Streamlit, as regards to other popular Python web frameworks being used by Data Scientists and ML Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

It was fun. And it was stressful too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’d talk about the highs and lows of working on this project while also elaborating on the groundwork, the process, the results, and the future scope of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous knowledge expected Machine Learning, Deep Learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
