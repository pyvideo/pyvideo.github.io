This talk walks through the steps involved in building a recommendation pipeline, from data cleaning, hyperparameter tuning, model training and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personalized recommendation systems play an integral role in e-commerce platforms, with the goal of driving user engagement. While there is extensive literature on the theory behind recommendation systems, there is limited material that describes the underlying infrastructure of a recommendation system pipeline. In this talk, we will walk through the process of designing and building a recommendation system pipeline. We will specifically discuss techniques for data cleaning and normalization, hyperparameter tuning, model training and fitting, as well as quantitative and qualitative model evaluation. By the end of this talk, you will learn how to design your own recommendation system pipeline from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

factors: past medical history and comorbidities, physical exam findings,
lab results, imaging, ECG findings, and in some cases, genomic testing.
Clinical diagnosis and prognostic assessment currently relies on expert
knowledge of the treating physician. Recent developments in machine
learning make it possible to build automated clinical diagnostic and
risk assessment tools using data from the electronic medical record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk walks through the steps involved in building a clinical risk
assessment model, using sepsis as a case study. A large part of the talk
will focus on the tools and techniques involved in pre-processing
complex medical data, and strategies for evaluating model results.&lt;/p&gt;
