goes from something small and simple to a full-blown multi-server,
multi-datacenter behemoth. The talk will use examples from real-world
applications I’ve either built or contributed do, and draw heavily
from my experience leading the development of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.commcarehq.org/"&gt;CommCare HQ&lt;/a&gt; (an 8-year old, ~500,000 LoC
codebase currently developed and maintained by about 20 people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the talk is to try and demonstrate how and why complexity
and process seeps into projects over time and is in fact necessary as a
project’s lifecycle matures. I'll base the talk around a series of
examples that highlight a problem and then discuss how the introduction
of a new subsystem, architecture, or process helps to address that
problem. These problems / solutions will be a mix of the technical (e.g.
&amp;quot;the site is slow&amp;quot;) and human (e.g. &amp;quot;we can't ship features quickly
anymore&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is part of a growing project or team should hopefully learn
something or get some ideas for what might be in store for your future!&lt;/p&gt;
