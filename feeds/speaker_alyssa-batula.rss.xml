Data scientists
complain that Agile frameworks are too restrictive and deadline-focused
to accommodate the type of work they do. Scrum masters and product
owners have a hard timing planning around unclear timelines and
uncertain outcomes, and wish the data scientists would just tell them
how much effort a task will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't have to be this way! Data science and Agile can work
together to create a better system for everyone. In this talk I'll
highlight tips and pitfalls from my own experience, as well as stories
I've heard from my colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
