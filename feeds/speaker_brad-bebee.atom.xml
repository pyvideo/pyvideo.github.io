Graph analytics offer a solution for extracting meaning from the mass.
Applied examples include: discovering malicious exfiltrators in networks
with millions of connections, or finding optimal drug targets in
elaborate chemical pathways. Multiple low-level GPU-accelerated graph
frameworks exist, but a steep learning curve has prevented widespread
use of iterative graph analytics by the data science community. This
session will focus on PyDASL, a Python tool capable of performing GPU
accelerated graph operations. PyDASL enables developers to quickly
author iterative graph analytics with up to 9,000% less code than other
comparably performing GPU-accelerated graph frameworks. We will show the
ease of writing and executing a new graph analytic and review PyDASLâ€™s
built-in analytics.Presenter(s): Speaker: Anne Struble, Systap Speaker:
