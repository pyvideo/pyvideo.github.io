the way we discover and treat the root genetic causes of disease. Many
of the most popular tools and libraries in this cutting edge application
are written in Python. This talk will provide a general,
software-centric introduction to the exciting new area of genome
editing, describe the central string search, machine learning, and data
management problems involved, and review how Python frameworks and
libraries are used today to solve these problems in Production in order
to benefit human health. This talk assumes no prior lab experience: only
a proficiency with Python and curiosity!&lt;/p&gt;
