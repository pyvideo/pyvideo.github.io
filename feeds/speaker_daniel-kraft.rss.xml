python, LXC and linux with a web-UI based on django and angularjs. We'll
show the underlying architecture of this service, several linux
internals that make this possible and we'll talk about bitter failure
during development. This talk will be python- and linux-centric with
some hints for integrating angularjs into django.&lt;/p&gt;
