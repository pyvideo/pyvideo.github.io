Gail is a
university lecturer in programming and cyberpsychology. They have had
some interesting conversations and Thomas isn’t the only one who has
learned a lot this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Thomas will share his insights into common higher
education practices which can make it harder for people like him to
learn, and why cyber security education in particular could benefit from
recognising and addressing this. Gail will reflect on where she’s got to
in her own contribution to that process and invite suggestions for doing
better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software development is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As grown-ups we know better than to believe that difficult things can be achieved by a simple wave of a magic wand, yet faith persists that this new idea, that new tool, will make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile for the hard-bitten cynics it is all the emperor's new clothes. I invite you to join me in a more constructive realm between belief and cynicism, where we can embrace the power of stories, listen with an open mind, but not be bewitched by the expectation of a fairy-tale ending.&lt;/p&gt;
