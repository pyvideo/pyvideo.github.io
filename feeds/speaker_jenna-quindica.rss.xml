supposed to be strong and resilient. It's okay not to be strong or
resilient all the time. Discussing mental illness is uncomfortable. In
this talk, I will help you overcome that discomfort by examining the
most common mental health issues, how you can get help for yourself, and
how you can best support your coworkers, friends, and family. No one
should have to deal with mental illness alone. Bring your tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
