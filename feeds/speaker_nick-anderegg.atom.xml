algorithmically compare pairs of Chinese characters for use in
psycholinguistic research. By programmatically representing the
structure of Chinese characters, it is possible to quantify the
similarity of two characters in the same way it is possible to quantify
the similarity of two English words by comparing their constituent
letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Nick Anderegg Bio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick is an MSc student in Cognitive Psychology at Western University,
with a primary research area in reading, phonology, and computational
psycholinguistics. He earned a BPhil degree in Linguistics and a BA
degree in Psychology from Penn State University. He's primarily
interested in understanding universal reading processes that speakers of
different languages have in common, and how cross-linguistic differences
in writing systems and phonology interact with these processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
