&lt;p&gt;We will talk about how Python can be helpful in the machine learning
projects. We will consider every step of the process starting with the
idea where data- driven predictions can be helpful, through data
preparation, data modelling, communication of the results using various
visualizations and implementation on production including monitoring of
model performance. I will mention various Python libraries that can be
of use on each step and consider real use cases to dive deeper into some
of the mentioned steps. During the talk I will also mention open source
Python library for easy data access that we develop in Fandom.&lt;/p&gt;
