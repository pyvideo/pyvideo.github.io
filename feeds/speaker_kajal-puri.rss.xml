voice of the artificially intelligent system is going to be a
significant interface to interact with a human, apart from the text. The
research on speech-to-text has been going on since quite a few years
after we've taken a big leap on the Deep Learning approach. In this
talk, I'm going to talk mainly about the Mozilla's DeepSpeech open
source project to convert speech-to-text in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the new problem at hand is how an artificially intelligent system
can give a human-like voice to the written text because when a human
speaks, there are a lot of intricacies in our speech that is so obvious
for the human brain. Expressions in our voice, where to give a pause,
and accent etc are few important factors that play a big role in how
humans talk to each other. So, here I'm going to introduce WaveNet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will be divided in following four segments :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0-5 minutes: The talk will begin with explaining the Speech-to-text
earlier existing libraries and which machine learning models they
used. Comparison of various libraries like Cloud speech-to-text by
Google, IBM Watson and DeepSpeech will be done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5-25 minutes: DeepSpeech is based on Baidu's DeepSpeech research
paper. This model directly translates raw audio data into text -
without any domain specific code in between. I'll quickly brief about
the underlying deep learning architecture used in DeepSpeech. A short
live-demo will be given and the code, written in Python, will be
explained with the tips on hyper-parametric tuning to get the best
possible results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25-45 minutes: Now, the talk will switch to the latest research going
on in the field of Text-to-speech and how products like Alexa, Siri,
Google Assistant etc are leveraging this to behave like a human. The
deep learning architecture of WaveNet, open sourced by Google's
DeepMind, will be discussed followed by the live-demo and explaining
the code written in Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;45-50 minutes: For QA session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

it became the fastest and most accurate library in Python for text
classification and word representation. It is to be seen as a substitute
for gensim package's word2vec. It includes the implementation of two
extremely important methodologies in NLP i.e Continuous Bag of Words and
Skip-gram model. Fasttext performs exceptionally well with supervised as
well as unsupervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial will be divided in following four segments :&lt;/p&gt;
