&lt;p&gt;[Wicklow Hall 1 on 2022-07-13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building distributed systems can be challenging, and that's what microservices are. With traditional request/response based architectures, it is easy to end up with services that are tightly coupled, making them difficult to maintain and extend independently. While not a silver bullet, an event-based architecture makes it easier to maintain loose coupling. It also makes it easier to extend and evolve our systems without resorting to a rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will look at an example of an event-driven microservices application and discuss some things to consider when adopting this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s see how to avoid that by building lightweight, loosely coupled microservices with the Flask framework and Apache Kafka.&lt;/p&gt;

As real-time event streaming has become a necessity in many organizations, a plethora of libraries, frameworks, and applications have arisen to help meet that need. These different tools each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and you may end up deciding to use one or more of them, but many problems can be solved with a simpler approach.
