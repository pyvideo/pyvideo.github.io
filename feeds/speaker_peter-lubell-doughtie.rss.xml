will tally votes in the Libyan elections and decide who wins and who
loses. This is not something we could get wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not something we could get wrong. We combined agile development
with best practices in testing and QA to build an open source tally
system that was well tested, accurate, and easy to use. We will describe
a success story of iterative behavior/test-driven-development under
extreme conditions. Did the structure of the data change the day before
the election? Yes. Did we have the tests to ensure that our
implementation changes would not compromise the system's integrity? Yes,
and they didn't. This talk provides a narrative to both Software
Engineers and Tech/Product Managers describing why best practices are
essential for any organization and any project of any size. We will
provide the audience with: 1. Real world examples they can implement in
their own workflow and organizations, 2. Insight into what succeeded
(quick iteration with prioritization) and what was challenging (nothing
being static), 3. Anecdotes and coherent arguments they can take back to
their organization to advocate for best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
