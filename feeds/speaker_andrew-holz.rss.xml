Bad idea. 1-on-1s are critical for building trust, providing feedback, and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keys to good 1-on-1s start with a small amount of prep and a running shared document of notes and takeaways. Another key is to rotate types of 1-on-1s. Possibilities include &amp;quot;heads down&amp;quot; on recent work, &amp;quot;heads up&amp;quot; looking further out, and career-focused sessions. After some tips on the right sort of questions and uncovering sneaky issues, I will also touch on effective feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will share resources and hope to include Seussian visuals and a few poetic lines to help the key points stick.&lt;/p&gt;
