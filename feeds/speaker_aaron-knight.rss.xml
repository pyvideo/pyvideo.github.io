But in the real world, production data sometimes needs to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you made some bad choices when setting up your models. Or maybe a bug introduced some inconsistent data. So how do you fix it? The na√Øve approach might be to run an update directly on your production database, but that kind of approach is extremely risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will outline some best practices for fixing production data. We'll go beyond the obvious precautions such as testing your scripts and ensuring that you have a database backup. Instead, this talk will focus on writing scripts that are idempotent, reversible, and performant.&lt;/p&gt;

building pipelines of batch processes. It &amp;quot;handles dependency
resolution, workflow management, visualization, handling failures,
command line integration, and much more&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we will use Luigi to build a data pipeline that runs a
series of interdependent jobs. We will also discuss some real-world use
cases for Luigi, and show how it can make running a data pipeline much
more robust and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
