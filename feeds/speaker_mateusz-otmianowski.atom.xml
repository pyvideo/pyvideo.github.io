connected with implementing state-of-the-art techniques for modelling
learners knowledge using Recurrent Neural Networks (Deep Knowledge
Tracing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Tracing (KT) is one of the most important research areas in
personalized education nowadays. It allows us to trace learners’
knowledge over time so that we can accurately predict how they will
perform in the future. By improving the quality of such models we can
better adjust the adaptive learning experience to the needs of
particular students. In recent years the idea of using recurrent neural
networks for learners knowledge tracing (Deep Knowledge Tracing, DKT)
gained a lot of attention, as it has been shown that it generally
outperforms traditional methods. During our presentations we will share
the results and experiences connected with implementing this method in
one of the Pearson personalized learning products. We will focus on
challenges that we have encountered during the model development process
related to the framework we’ve used (TensorFlow), training performance,
experiment tracking and having multiple people working simultaneously on
the same model. We’ll also share the results and compare them with the
state of the art results from other papers.&lt;/p&gt;
