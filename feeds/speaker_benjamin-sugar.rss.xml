&amp;quot;civic making&amp;quot; and a new space that has opened up in Chicago to
encourage this type creation, CivicLab. As an example of &amp;quot;civic making&amp;quot;
I will discuss Between the Bars, a paper based blogging platform for
those who are incarcerated, built in Django. I will also discuss our
choice in framework and the pros/cons of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
