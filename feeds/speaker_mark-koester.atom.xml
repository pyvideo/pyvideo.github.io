But what can we do with all this data? Can it help you become a better version of yourself?
While we often hear about data in terms of data leaks and surveillance, personal data and self-tracking can be empowering too.  With smartphones, wearables, tracking apps, home sensors, and many other methods, it’s easier than ever to collect a lot of data on our lives. But we are still struggling to engage and find meaning in all of the data we collect.
Python and its data science toolset can help transform personal data into a personal dashboard of data visualizations and predictive models. How can python help us better collect, visualize, understand and find patterns in our personal data and self-tracking?
In this talk, I’ll show you how to track your life in different ways, and, with python’s data science toolkit, how to engage and understand that data. The stated goal of the quantified self and self-tracking is to “measure or document something about your self such that it gains meaning.” I think we can go one step further and use data to become better; use data to become data-driven!&lt;/p&gt;

data to better understand and improve yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious how you are being tracking? Already like many people today
tracking your life but wondering what more you can do with your personal
data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easier than ever to track our lives, work and bodies with a
smartphone, wearable, home sensor or computer. If you have an Android or
iPhone, use a wearable like Fitbit, or even just watch videos on
Youtube, then you already got plenty of personal data, and we haven’t
even started to formally track our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a world of data, the question becomes: &lt;strong&gt;What can we do with all
this tracking data? Can it help you become a “better” version of
yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of great ways to work with and use your personal data,
even spreadsheet applications like Excel and Google Sheets and more
powerful data visualization tools like Tableau and Google Data Studio
can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you want to become a master of your personal data, then one of
the best tools is Python. Python is a great tool for not only
aggregating, collecting and cleaning up your data. But python enables
you to do robust data analysis and machine learning too too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk / workshop, we are exploring personal data, self-tracking,
and personal data analysis. In the first part, I’ll show the basics on
you how to track your life and all about the so-called “quantified
self.” In the second part on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger"&gt;QS Ledger&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll explain how to use
Python and its data science toolkit (Pandas, Matplot, Seaborn, etc.) for
data collection and data processing. Part 3 looks at how to do your own
Data Exploration, Analysis and Visualization on your own tracking data.
Through some simple code, you can even create your own Personal Data
Dashboard. Finally, in Part 4, we look at Machine Learning. We look at
where ML is typically used for personal data and some examples of how
you can use ML to better understand and improve yourself. In the
conclusion, I share some of tips and recommendations for anyone wanting
to pursue a data-driven life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring together your personal data in interesting ways. Clean and process
it. Find patterns with some simple data analysis. Make it beautiful with
data visualization. Discover meaning, insights, and correlations using
predictive analytics and machine learning. Finally, improve your life by
transforming personal data into a data-driven life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, can self-tracking and personal data help us become more
productive, healthier, and happier? I think it can. Learn how to engage
with your data to be smarter, make more informed decisions and become
data-driven!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outline&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
