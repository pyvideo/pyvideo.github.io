For
almost two years asyncio community have written a lot of drivers to
different databases. Nevertheless, there are still a lot of libraries
that need to be ported or written from scratch. Lack of information on
proper use and writing code in asyncio slows down asyncio adoption.
Nikolay will talk about how to write your own client for database or
message queue using asyncio and protocol pipelining, also he will give
overview of internals for most popular database libraries: aiopg,
aiomysql, aioredis and aioodbc as well as bunch of asyncio tips and
tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
