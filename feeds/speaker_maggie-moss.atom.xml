That’s why we built Pyre and now Pyrefly. Despite this, Meta has lots of untyped code and we have been building tooling to help add types at scale. This talk will explore the benefits of typed Python, how to increase types in your codebase and leverage new tools like Pyrefly to improve developer experience in large Python codebases.&lt;/p&gt;

However, driving for type adoption on a rapidly changing codebase under active development can pose several challenges. This presentation will focus on how you can get meaningful results from Pyre as you move from just a few annotations to a fully typed codebase, and the guarantees we can make along the way. Then, I will discuss the approaches and tools we use to increase type coverage and “strictify” the Instagram codebase, one of the largest active Python projects.&lt;/p&gt;
