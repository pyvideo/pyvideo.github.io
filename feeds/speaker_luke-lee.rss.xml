However, documentation gets out of date, forgotten, or sometimes ignored. Simple documentation requires team members to constantly remember all the ‘rules’ for your project. You can better enforce those rules and free up your team members to think about harder problems using linting tools like flake8, import linter, and pre-commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools provide tons of useful stuff out of the box, but you can push them so much further with customization. This allows your project to formally document conventions, but also enforce them automatically on every commit, merge, and build. This can make code reviews faster and more focused on the problems your code is meant to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce tools like flake8, import linter, and pre-commit along with some of their built-in functionality. Then, we’ll briefly explore some ways to customize them to fit your projects’ specific needs. Some examples of custom linter rules we’ll tour are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code formatted automatically and uniformly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code doesn’t import across architecture layers violating separation of concerns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common conventions are used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common anti-patterns are avoided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific layers are fully tested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proper git commit message formatting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge commits don’t exist in topic/feature branches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’ll discuss ways to use those custom linter rules on every commit, merge, and build with continuous integration or git hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the talk, you’ll see several real-world linter rules used on Kraken, which is a large Django-based project used to supply green energy to millions of users across the world. In addition, expect no shortage of ideas for your own projects along the way!&lt;/p&gt;

</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Luke Lee</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:pyvideo.org,2022-07-11:/europython-2022/lint-all-the-things.html</guid><category>EuroPython 2022</category></item><item><title>Script, Library, or Executable: You can have it all!</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-de-2018/script-library-or-executable-you-can-have-it-all.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will describe one possible way to achieve this using the following
features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to create a package layout that can support a CLI interface, an
importable library, and a GUI all while sharing as much code as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although text and graphical interfaces are very different we can provide
a consistent API with careful consideration. This way users can easily
use our library or either interface without starting all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we will layout a single-file CLI script using argparse similar to
the Unix &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;wc&lt;/tt&gt; tool that takes a text file and outputs the following
information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;__name__ == __main__&lt;/tt&gt; Python idiom, separating the
argument parsing from the main function, and why keeping as little as
possible in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;__main__&lt;/tt&gt; is better for reusability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several pros and cons to providing others with a single-file
script. It's easy to develop and simple to read, but it requires any
user to have the correct version of Python installed. It's also
difficult for other developers to reuse the code in their own projects
or deploy to PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we'll take our single-file script and expand it into a basic Python
package using a main folder, &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;.py, and a cli.py script to expose
the same CLI as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss how to restructure the main and parsing functions from
step 1 into an public API defined by the &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;.py that exposes the
same CLI functionality as a library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won't dive into setup.py at all, but there will be links and a brief
description on the various tools to layout a package such as
cookiecutter and setup.py.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey"&gt;Gooey&lt;/a&gt; project can easily
expose a CLI as GUI with a few decorators. We'll discuss briefly how to
use Gooey and some of the extra functionality it provides to create more
advanced GUIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also give a simple mental model for how it maps argparse argument
types to GUI widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until step 3 all we required of users was a working Python 3
installation. However, adding Gooey requires users to have a working
Python installer, the Gooey library, and wxPython. Typically GUIs are
meant for higher-level users so asking them to install all of this to
benefit from our little app is too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead we'll see how we run PyInstaller on our entry script to package
up all our dependencies &lt;strong&gt;including&lt;/strong&gt; Python itself into a simple
executable. We'll briefly discuss the build and dist output folders from
PyInstaller along with the ability to use it to package all sorts of
complicated Python applications using Qt, Numpy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End-users in management don't even have to know we used Python!&lt;/p&gt;

However, finding the right pieces and assembling them into a fast and
scale-able app can be a daunting task. This talk will explore common
requirements of scientific apps and how to fulfill those from the Python
ecosystem. It will also provide a blueprint for building apps using
tools like PyQt, PyQwt, numpy, and HDF5.&lt;/p&gt;

Python's object model explained.</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pytexas-2012/dunder-what-pythons-object-model-explained.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke Lee is a full-time Python developer writing desktop GUI and scientific computing applications in the oil and gas industry. He is a regular member of the Houston Python and Django groups. After several years of writing embedded software in C for Solid State Disks, Luke jumped head first into the Python ecosystem. He came to Python for the whitespace and stuck with it for the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python's more advanced features like descriptors, context managers, and meta-programming can be more easily understood by investigating the object model and dunder methods. This talk will explore what dunder methods are, why their useful, and how they contribute to the overall design of a fully Pythonic object.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, he writes scientific Python applications for Blueback Reservoir in Houston, TX. His enthusiasm for Python is emphasized throughout his presentations at several Python related conferences including Pycon, PyTexas, and PyArkansas. He is also an active member of the Houston Django and Python user groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of approaches and philosophies to prevent bugs in software, but
the truth is they are unavoidable in complex, modern systems. So, what's a
developer to do? Code in a style that tries to alert and test for the bugs
when they happen instead of feeling like a failure when you can't prevent the
unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia defines this style of programming as 'defensive programming,' and the
idea is code in a way that expects software to be misused and have bugs. This
talk will explore this general concept and how to add bits of this style of
development to you Python code with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asserts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
