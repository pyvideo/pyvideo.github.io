This talk will look to clearly define magic and answer the question of &amp;quot;when is magic harmful?&amp;quot;
​
Abstract
This talk will look into some libraries we use (and love!) and the magic that powers them.
​
We will look at how things like namedtuple, Django models, and the Flask request object are implemented. We will look at how each of these libraries encapsulates complexity. At the end of the talk (hopefully) we will understand more about the internals of these libraries and have new tools to gauge if magic should be considered harmful for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bio
Adam is a tech lead at Disqus and advocate for service-oriented architecture. He has given several talks at Pycon and EuroPycon on the high scale systems that Disqus has shipped to production.

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This talk will overview what it took to add realtime to a truly “web
scale” app. The result is the DISQUS realtime system, a highly
concurrent system for allowing web clients to subscribe to arbitrary
events in the DISQUS infrastructure. The talk will be about 30 minutes
with an extended Question/Answer/Open discussion time (because your
ideas are good too!). Overview of the architecture (redis + gevent +
flask) and why those choices were made Numbers! how much concurrency and
msg/s we are supporting with realtime How we baked high availability
into the application, not just the infrastructure Overview of the
hardware involved Lessons learned (what broke hard, what worked awesome)
Suggested audience experience: Medium/Advanced level experience
Familiarity with Flask, Gevent/Eventlet would be really good.&lt;/p&gt;

And we love it! It
has, however, grown rather large and unwieldy. In the last year Disqus
has had an increasing number of smaller services cropping up based on
several different platforms. So this talk will be about how we do
continuous deployment with our emerging service-based infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
