The regions involved in concentration, impulse
control, inhibition, and motor activity are smaller than usual; Like
somewhere between 5% and 12% of adults I have ADHD. Even if you do not
have the disorder yourself you probably work, live or know someone who
does. But the world is not designed for people with ADHD, so to be
successful I’ve had to develop techniques to keep my concentration and
procrastination in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;What is ADHD?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;How can we change our workspaces to help focus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Being more productive without burning out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Communicating as a team without interrupting flow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is not just for those people with ADHD, although they will
benefit as well. It is for anyone whose job requires long bouts of
focus or “flow”. The primary audience of the talk will be
programmers, but it will also benefit team leads, product managers,
and technical writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no specialist knowledge required to understand this talk. I
do give a brief overview of the start of what ADHD is to establish
context, but the talk focuses on productivity, not psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope people will leave with ideas about how they can make their
workplace, their team and themselves more productive, less stressed
and distracted, and ultimately more happy in their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
