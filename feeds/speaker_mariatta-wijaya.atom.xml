Various mentors have helped me navigate the open source community and help advanced my skills. I realized finding a mentor is not as easy as it seems, and it takes a lot of courage to reach out in the first place. And then, there is impostor syndrome, where one may feel like they don't deserve the help.
In this talk, I will provide advice about working with mentor.
Asking for help is not a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the questions I often receive ever since I became a Python core developer a year ago. Contributing to Python is a long journey that does not end when one earns the commit privilege. There are responsibilities to bear and expectations to live up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn how to automate your workflow by building a personal GitHub assistant for your own project. We'll use libraries called &lt;cite&gt;gidgethub&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;aiohttp&lt;/cite&gt; to write a GitHub bot that does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greet the person who created an issue in your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say thanks when a pull request has been closed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply a label to issues or pull requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives a thumbs up reaction to comments &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; made. (becoming your own personal cheer squad).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is, you get to do all of the above using Python 3.6! F-strings included!&lt;/p&gt;

Developers often talk about how important it is. But what really happens during code review? What do you achieve out of it? How can we learn during code review? This talk will present ideas of what should be the goals of a code review, and how developers can learn during code review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code reviewing is considered to be an important phase in software development to ensure code quality. Generally during code review, the goal is to find mistakes, if any was made. This can create a negative experience to the team. It’s likely that some team member is not comfortable with the idea of having their work scrutinized. Junior developers may feel like they are not qualified enough to provide feedback. This talk will explore the different goals of code review process. In addition to ensure code quality, code review should be considered as a learning tool. It should be considered a positive and rewarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;
