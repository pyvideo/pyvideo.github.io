The acceptance of PEP 581, by Python steering council means that another big workflow change is impending. Let's hear about some of the proposed plans on improving CPython's workflow, and learn how you can help and take part in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded at the PyConDE &amp;amp; PyData Berlin 2019 conference.

Learn
how the Python core team automated their GitHub workflow with bots,
making it easier for maintainers and contributors to collaborate
together. Even if you’re not managing a large project, you can still
build your own bot! Hear some ideas on what you can automate on GitHub
and personalize your bot based on your own workflow. All you need is
Python. Don’t be a robot; build the bot.&lt;/p&gt;

How can I become one? What is it like to be a Python core developer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the questions I often receive ever since I became a Python core developer a year ago. Contributing to Python is a long journey that does not end when one earns the commit privilege. There are responsibilities to bear and expectations to live up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, I've been learning more about what it really means to be a Python core developer. Let me share all of that with you.&lt;/p&gt;

You can take it to the next level by creating custom GitHub bots. By delegating some of the chores to a bot, you get to spend more time developing your project and collaborating with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to automate your workflow by building a personal GitHub assistant for your own project. We'll use libraries called &lt;cite&gt;gidgethub&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;aiohttp&lt;/cite&gt; to write a GitHub bot that does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greet the person who created an issue in your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say thanks when a pull request has been closed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply a label to issues or pull requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives a thumbs up reaction to comments &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; made. (becoming your own personal cheer squad).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part is, you get to do all of the above using Python 3.6! F-strings included!&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will present ideas of what should be the goals of a code review, and how developers can learn during code review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code reviewing is considered to be an important phase in software development to ensure code quality. Generally during code review, the goal is to find mistakes, if any was made. This can create a negative experience to the team. It’s likely that some team member is not comfortable with the idea of having their work scrutinized. Junior developers may feel like they are not qualified enough to provide feedback. This talk will explore the different goals of code review process. In addition to ensure code quality, code review should be considered as a learning tool. It should be considered a positive and rewarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;
