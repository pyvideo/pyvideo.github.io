&lt;p&gt;Over 20 years ago Joel Spolsky famously wrote, &amp;quot;All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.&amp;quot; Unsurprisingly this has not changed. However, we have introduced more and more layers of abstraction into our workflows: Virtual Machines, AWS services, WASM, Docker, R, Python, data frames, and on and on. But then on top of the computational abstractions we have people abstractions: managers, colleagues, executives, stakeholders, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JD's presentation will be a wild romp through the mental models of abstractions and discuss how we, as technical analytical types, can gain skill in traversing abstractions and dealing with leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
