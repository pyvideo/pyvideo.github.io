&lt;p&gt;First an introduction to blockchains in general. Most have heard about
blockchains or bitcoin but how does it actually work and what is the
technology driving it? This talk will explain what a cryptocurrency
wallet is, how transactions are created and how they are brought
together to form blocks that build the blockchain. I will outline
differences between the most widely used implementations and the core
technological concepts behind them, like Proof-of-Work versus
Proof-of-Stake, consensus algorithms, trustless systems and the ideas
behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second half of the talk I draw on my experience working with
python in my professional career and give an overview of the python
ecosystem for blockhain and cryptocurrency development. I will showcase
some of the libraries and tools that exist, like btcpy and highlight
some of the pros and cons (mostly pros) of using python in this sector.&lt;/p&gt;
