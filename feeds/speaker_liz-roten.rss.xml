Often, you may be the only user on in the cubicle-block. But, one miraculous day, your manager finally fills the void and you welcome more folks on your team. Suddenly, the little R system you created to suit your needs, like a custom package, code styling, and file organization, isn't just for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to suddenly overhaul that one package you wrote two years ago? It probably won't work when your colleagues try to update it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your new teammates are data.table fans, but you prefer the tidyverse. Do you need to refactor? Are style choices, like indentation important when collaborating, or are you just being persnickety?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you will learn how to bring new teammates on board and blend your respective styles without pulling your hair out.&lt;/p&gt;
