The talk will focus on a subset of the field of property-based testing where we focus on testing by automatically generating properties and test strategies from the API Schemas that we often already have. These tests ensure that our APIs conform to their specified schema and enables us to write a much larger amount of tests in less time. I will focus on the schemathesis library which leverages the strong hypothesis library as well as the hypothesis-JSONSchema extension strategies, and will in the future also support GraphQL via the hypothesis-graphql strategies. I’m a contributor to schemathesis and currently working on the future GraphQL support with schemathesis creator, Dmitry Dygalo. I will also compare it with its predecessor “swagger-conformance”, pure property-based testing through hypothesis, schema strategies with hypothesis-graphql and hypothesis-jsonschema, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. I will also briefly talk about “QuickREST: Property-based Test Generation of OpenAPI-Described RESTful APIs” (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09686"&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09686&lt;/a&gt;), the research paper that’s part of the inspiration for these tools. By focusing on property-based test generation using schemas we already have, I will show that a field like property-based testing, which can seem quite daunting at first, actually can have a low barrier to entry while yielding large amounts of value in return and is useful for most common web projects today. The talk will show how formal schemas for APIs can and will continue to provide additional value outside the scope of documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

They’re fast, secure and easy to maintain. Combining your static sites with 3rd party APIs enables you at make your website feel and function like a traditional dynamic website with all the upsides of a static site. In this talk Shy Ruparel, developer evangelist at Contentful, examines the history of static sites, their benefits, how to make them dynamic all while using Flask!&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, being able to &amp;quot;hook up&amp;quot; a custom data back-end without breaking a sweat clinched the deal. The application in question that I would like to talk about is Contextualise (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.contextualise.dev/"&gt;https://www.contextualise.dev/&lt;/a&gt;), a (personal) knowledge management application.

OAuth is a notoriously complicated protocol, but you can't use any of these APIs without it. In this talk, we'll learn how OAuth works and why it's so complicated. We'll also use the Flask-Dance library to write a demo application that can authenticate with an API via OAuth. By the end, you'll be ready to tackle any OAuth API you want!&lt;/p&gt;

All the JavaScript is usually included straight from .js files or just minified with Python tools like webassets. But the JavaScript ecosystem has evolved a lot - one can now use tools like Babel to write modern JS even when targeting older browsers and a Webpack+Babel build is very straightforward and allows for advanced preprocessing of JavaScript code. In this talk we'll even go one step further and not only use Webpack to build the assets, but also integrate a small demo Flask app with a React frontend where the Flask app only serves the static HTML page and uses a RESTful API to communicate with the React app. We'll also look into how to keep convenient Flask features such as URL building in client-side code (using the js-flask-urls package) and of course React hooks will be used!&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding how each context works is important when developing Flask applications, and yet they are often misunderstood. This talk dives into how the application and request contexts work when handling a request. The concept of proxies is discussed for providing thread-local access to the application and request contexts. To really illustrate how the application context works, pytest will be utilized to show how the application context works outside of a request. This example shows a common error ('Working outside of application context') during testing and how it should be solved by pushing to the application context stack.&lt;/p&gt;

Within a few weeks, I fell in love with the simplicity and power of using Python. After finishing the course, I wondered, “What else can I do with Python?” A few months later, I started programming my first web application in Python called PythonBuddy (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pythonbuddy.com"&gt;https://pythonbuddy.com&lt;/a&gt;/​) while doing research with Professor Eni Mustafaraj of Wellesley College. We were motivated to create this web app to help students jump right into programming without the burden of setting up a programming IDE. The first technology to create PythonBuddy was Flask. I was amazed at how simple and easy it was to set up basic web functionalities such as AJAX requests, templating, and testing. To this day, I still use Flask to set up web applications due to its simplicity and robustness. In this talk, I’ll walk through how I developed PythonBuddy using Flask and other places I’ve used Flask with.&lt;/p&gt;

It does what it does best&amp;quot; I heard these words from a colleague of mine a while ago. And I couldn't agree more. Flask is great. It's my to go to web framework when developing web applications. It doesn't pack too much but it's easily scalable. Let's be honest though, aren't there times where you just thought &amp;quot;if only it could do this..&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I wish it supported ...&amp;quot;? For this session, we are going to go through Flask's testing support feature. We are going to see what it offers out of the box. We are going to cover some of it's downsides. Finally, we are going to cover a couple of enhancements one can add to make testing smoother and more fun :)&lt;/p&gt;

It is currently driven by twelve microservices. The frontend microservice is implemented in React. Most backend microservices are implemented in Flask. In this session the challenges and solutions of building a microservice architecture for OpenPatch with Flask will be presented. It will be shown how authentication with JWT via a centralized authentification service is implemented, how communication between the microservices with RabbitMQ is integrated, how versioning of microservices (api-endpoints and database-schemas) is used to keep backward-compatibility and what means are set up to ease the development of new microservices. This session should provide insights in the development of a microservice architecture with Flask, which could help others developers to implement their own or to spark the discussion of best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

At the end of the talk, the audience should know what CSRF tokens and Cross-site request forgery attacks are and how to prevent them in their next web application, and should be educated on how to use Json Web Tokens (JWT) to securely transfer data over API requests and the consequences of not doing this well. Web security is not a thing taught by default in tutorials, and this ends up raising a generation of web developers building applications that are vulnerable to attacks taught to cyber security personnel in HACKER 101 courses. A lot of vulnerabilities exist in web apps we use and build everyday and when triggered can lead to destruction of businesses and loss of tons of money. Trust me, I’ve had experience with this and it’s not funny. The talk is aimed at the intermediate python developer who has experience using the flask framework to build web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Flask-RESTy provides a flexible API with multiple levels of abstraction, ranging from high-level helpers that allow building CRUD APIs in just a few lines of code, to lower-level helpers that allow implementing highly customized business logic while preserving consistent authorization and validation logic. Through the use of these different elements of the library built on top of each other, developers can both implement complex endpoints in a consistent way and quickly spin up more conventional endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
