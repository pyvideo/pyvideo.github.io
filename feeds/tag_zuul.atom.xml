CI/CD systems in service of OpenStack’s early decision to mandate that
all merges only be performed by automation if and only if all tests
pass. Accomplishing this at scale involves a combination of software and
policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuul is the software engine developed to handle this. It is, of course,
written in Python. (Python3 to be exact!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zuul is not OpenStack specific. With the rise of microservices and
kubernetes, the number of multi-repo projects is increasing, as is the
need for CI systems that understand them. The most recent version of
Zuul has been reworked to make it easy for other people, communities or
organizations to harness its power regardless of any relationship with
OpenStack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll talk about the things that make Zuul special - multi-repository
dependencies, optimistic branch prediction and deep Ansible integration.
And we’ll walk through how to get started with a private or a public
Zuul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also the parts of the equation that Zuul doesn’t cover.
Handling thousands of different python projects requires some specific
choices and tradeoffs, so we’ll discuss how we structure the projects,
dependency management and release engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
