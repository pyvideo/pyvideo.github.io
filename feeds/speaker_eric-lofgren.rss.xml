Django which allows students and researchers interested in the modeling
of infectious diseases to learn both modeling and scientific computing
skills in an interactive environment, without forcing theoretical and
computational skills to be developed simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computational and mathematical models can yield profound insights in the
study of the spread of infectious diseases, illustrating difficult
concepts such as herd immunity, suggesting new avenues for empirical
research, and obtaining repeatable, quantifiable evidence in situations
where other study designs are difficult if not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching infectious disease modeling presents a challenge however, as it
requires the development of three unrelated skill sets: the theory of
infectious disease models, subject-matter expertise about the diseases
themselves, and the programming skills needed to implement all but the
simplest models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than forcing these skill sets to be developed in parallel, &lt;em&gt;Zeke&lt;/em&gt;
is an educational platform meant to allow students to develop these
skills in sequence. It uses a zombie epidemic to remove the need for
specific expertise regarding disease systems, relying instead on a
familiar cultural reference. Students are allowed to first explore the
theory of modeling, a Django front-end enabling interaction with models
without the need for scientific computing skills. All the models are
however implemented to be stand-alone models that can be run using SciPy
or other packages, and as students grow in sophistication the
open-source nature of &lt;em&gt;Zeke&lt;/em&gt; allows them to develop both computational
and subject-specific expertise in a stepwise fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
