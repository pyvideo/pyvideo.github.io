misunderstood and overlooked. And yet they are extremely powerful and
expressive parts of the language. They can be especially useful in data
processing, systems integration, or in projects with limited resources.
In this talk, we'll get into the fundamentals of what iterators and
generators actually are, how they're different from one another, and how
they work under the hood. We will explore how to create your own custom
iterators and generators for use in your own projects. Throughout the
discussion, we'll make comparisons to the simple children's game &amp;quot;Snakes
&amp;amp; Ladders,&amp;quot; and by the end of the talk we should have a simple working
example of the game built with iterators and generators.&lt;/p&gt;
