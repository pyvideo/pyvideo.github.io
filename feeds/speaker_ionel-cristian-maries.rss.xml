&lt;p&gt;You've been making packages for a while now. Everything works almost
fine, however, lots of new features and tools have been developed
recently. Some are really obscure. And there's a chance they can save
you time and help you avoid &lt;em&gt;packaging-induced-pain&lt;/em&gt;. I'm willing to
bet couple of beers you haven't seen these features and/or tools
before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is going to show you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patterns and tricks you can use in your &lt;cite&gt;setup.py&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obscure pip/setuptools/virtualenv/python features you can use to improve your packaging experience (be it as a user of packages or a package author).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fledgeling alternative tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
