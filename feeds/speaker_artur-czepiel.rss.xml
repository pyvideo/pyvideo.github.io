There are newer and better
tools available to solve problems that even a couple of months/years ago
required a lot of hacking and/or ugly code. In this talk I'll show you
some examples of patterns and solutions that no longer apply and
current/latest best practices. Also why they are better, why you should
upgrade your code as soon as possible, and how to deal with 'obsoledge'.
Includes Request/Resposne, Databases, Templates, APIs, 3rd parties, and
more.&lt;/p&gt;
