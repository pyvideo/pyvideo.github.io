Parallel applications to allow for communication amongst processes. In
order to process large amounts of data and efficiently deal with complex
operations, the Message Passing Interface (MPI) provides primitives
optimized specifically to handle such cases. The increasing need for
applying parallelism to applications with growing complexity, is handled
through the use of MPI to scale across machines and to efficiently
utilize all available resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will detail various MPI primitives and delve into their
use cases that are applicable for modern-day high performance computing
needs. We will explore the MPI layer in the realm of Python and define
available means to utilize MPI with python.&lt;/p&gt;
