The mrfmsim framework uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model experiments and employs a plugin system that adds custom experiments and functionalities. Differing from common DAG-powered workflow packages, mrfmsim allows flexible customizations of experiments post-definition without rewriting the internal model, such as optimized looping. In the talk, we present the challenges in building simulation packages for experiments undergoing continuous development in a graduate research setting. We discuss the current one-off approach that led to error-prone code and how modularity, extendibility, and readability can speed up the development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
