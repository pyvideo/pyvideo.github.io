[EuroPython 2021 - Interactive session - 2021-07-28 - Argument-Clinic [Interactive]]
[Online]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Paula Dozsa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;imagiLabs is an EdTech startup based in Stockholm, on a mission to equip and empower girls to engage with tech. We created the imagiCharm, a programmable smart accessory, so that code and be brought to life and shown off! The imagiLabs app (iOS, Android, and web) is a truly social, inclusive platform for teenage girl coders to develop their skills. We also partner with schools, non-profits, and coding companies to bring groups of students our innovative coding curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 1 hour virtual session takes coders from lighting up one pixel at a time to making colorful animations in the imagiLabs app. Ideal for kids 8-16, but truly fun for all ~ learn the basics of Python with our creative coding tools!&lt;/p&gt;
