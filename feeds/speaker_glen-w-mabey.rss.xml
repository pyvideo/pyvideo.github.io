algorithms, in some cases C++ is mandated by a customer. However, a
foundation of numpy's behavior is the notion of reference-counted
instances, and implementing an efficient, cross-platform mechanism for
reference counting is no trivial prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference counting mechanisms already implemented in the Qt C++
toolkit provide a cross-platform foundation upon which a numpy-like
array class can be built. In this talk one such implementation is
discussed, QNDArray. In fact, by mimicking the numpy behaviors, the job
of implementing QNDArray became much easier, as the task of &amp;quot;defining
the behavior&amp;quot; became &amp;quot;adopting the behavior,&amp;quot; to include function names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the following aspects of the implementation were found to
be tricky and deserve discussion in this presentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slicing multidimensional arrays given the limitations of operator[]
in C++,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;const&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;partial specialization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implicit vs. explicit data sharing in Qt QNDArray has been deployed
in scientific research applications and currently has the following
features:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bit-packed boolean arrays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nascent masked array support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unit test suite that validates QNDArray behavior against numpy
behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bounds checking with Q_ASSERT() (becomes a no-op in release mode)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;memmap()ed arrays via QFile::map()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easily integrated as a QVariant value, leading to a natural mapping
from QVariantMap to Python dict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;float16 implementation including in-place compare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author has approval from his management to submit the source code
for QNDArray to the Qt Project and plans to have it freely available for
download via &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://qt.gitorious.org/"&gt;http://qt.gitorious.org/&lt;/a&gt; before the SciPy conference
begins.&lt;/p&gt;
