Datasets with HiGlass</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/scipy-2019/to-a-billion-and-beyond-how-to-visually-explore-compare-and-share-large-quantitative-datasets-with-higlass.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Features and patterns in large quantitative datasets are difficult to explore, compare, and communicate. We present the HiGlass application and library for interactive visualization and comparison of multiple multiscale datasets. Using a tile based API, we demonstrate how data can be dynamically rendered on the client irrespective of its size on the server. For comparison between datasets we demonstrate multiple interactively selectable modes for synchronized panning, zooming and value scaling. Finally, to share interactive views into the data, we store and disseminate the visualization as a combination of data location, aesthetics and synchronizations.&lt;/p&gt;
