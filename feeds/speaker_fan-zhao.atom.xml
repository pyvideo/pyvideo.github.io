Ubiquitous hardware and open software are the keys to democratizing AI and its benefits. Intel’s rich AI hardware and software portfolios in conjunction with optimized open frameworks such as PyTorch and its ecosystem libraries provide compelling options for any business or entity looking to innovate, develop, and deploy AI applications at scale. In this talk, we are going to provide a brief overview of Intel’s AI solutions, explore how we are working with the PyTorch community to advance “AI Everywhere”, and showcase how you can easily leverage hardware and software AI acceleration to seamlessly optimize your applications.&lt;/p&gt;
