PHDs to be able to implement anything impactful with data science. In
this talk I will attempt to dispel this myth and show how software
developers can skip getting the machine learning PHD and start building
awesome software with Data Science and Machine Learning today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe developers are well situated to implement data science
projects as they possess the understanding of how the product works, how
users like to interact with the product and their opinions are already
valued within the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help developers level up their data science skills, Iâ€™ll discuss the
core concepts behind the most prevalent methods in data science, how the
data science process works, how to think like a data scientist, which
frameworks and programming languages to choose (surprise Python!) and
how to measure and communicate the value-add of data science projects to
the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About the speaker: Helge Reikeras is a Data Scientist at Offerzen with
over 6 years experience in practical data science and has also worked as
a software developer at various points in his career.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

recent years as companies are realising the value that data can yield
to their products, services, and business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll discuss a typical data science workflow, from
extracting the raw data through to serving real-time machine learning
predictions using a REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll feature a range of Python tools that make up the Data Science
pipeline, including Pandas, Scikit-learn, Gensim, Luigi, and Flask, and
show how these all can work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real-world implementation done at Offerzen will be presented as an
example.&lt;/p&gt;
