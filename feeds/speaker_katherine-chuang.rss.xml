&lt;p&gt;Wednesday 2:45 p.m.--3:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience level: Novice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on the conversations around rapid prototyping.
Miscommunication between developers and clients can occur because of
different perspectives and work styles. In this talk I'll introduce
interaction design concepts and templating with Django to show how easy
it is to set up a minimally viable UI and explain the value in letting
users feel that they have creative control. Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk will begin with an overview of some common communication problems
between developers and non-technical clients. For example, the client
may want to see a particular font but want to see how it looks before
making a final decision. Allowing them the flexibility to edit this
setting in the admin offsets some of the back and forth dialog and
editing CSS files numerous times. (2 mins)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intro to Interaction Design (5 mins) - Wireframing and design pattern
libraries - Screen sizes and responsive design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intro to Django Templates (8 mins) - Talk about the common template
elements (such as include tag for DRY design) - Tips on structuring
templates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viewing web applications as data flow diagrams (5 mins) - Describe DFD
diagrams - Organizing templates based on DFD components&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example of apps with different UIs for same data (10 mins) - Picture
dictionary (showing text, images, links)
(github.com/katychuang/django-snapbook) - Interactive reports on
statistics (github.com/katychuang/techsummitpr)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example of an app with pseudo apps (5 mins) - Using cloud hosted console
for prototyping with django (katychuang.pythonanywhere.com)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recap on design patterns and templates (1 min)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions &amp;amp; Discussion (rest of the time)&lt;/p&gt;
