learning machines. But they can be fooled by the different types of
noise present in your data. Training an algorithm on a large set of
variables, hoping that your model will separate signal from noise, is
not always the right approach. We'll discuss different ways to do
feature selection, and discuss open-source implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

Join Full Fact, the UK's independent factchecking charity, to discuss how they plan to make factchecking dramatically more effective with technology that exists now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Factchecking is just one solution to the multifaceted problem of fake news. The factcheckers fight is valiant but how can they keep up in such tumultuous times? Join Full Fact, the UK's independent factchecking charity, to discuss how they plan to make factchecking dramatically more effective with technology that exists now.&lt;/p&gt;
