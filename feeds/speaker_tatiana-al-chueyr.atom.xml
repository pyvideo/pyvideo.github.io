&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a collection of happy, but perhaps not so
efficient, HTTP micro-services that was being developed as part of a
major recommendation platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a snowy spring morning, their retirement was decreed. A new
generation of gRPC micro-services was to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the support of some brave pathfinders and a few sacrifices, the
gRPC micro-services finally reached their destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they lived happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is based on real facts. The pathfinders were data scientists
and engineers, the date is early 2018 and the location is BBC, UK.&lt;/p&gt;
