Second, while unsupervised topic models do a good job of clustering topics, creating robust, human-interpretable labels is challenging. Framing topic modeling as a search problem, helps overcome these challenges and makes it easier to use supervised or unsupervised topic models in real-time applications.&lt;/p&gt;
