Our codebase was nearly 4 million lines of code modified dozens of times a day by hundreds of total developers. It is also business critical, containing a large portion of our most important code and data. We used several tools, techniques, and patterns to achieve the migration without disrupting day-to-day development and keeping regressions a minimum. In this talk, weâ€™ll detail our migration steps, our usage of pre-commit hooks to reduce regressions to fixes, our usage of a reverse proxy to allow granular, low risk rollout for a webapp, and our migration of pickle to rollforward safe json for caching.&lt;/p&gt;
