Megan Price | Keynote: Using the Python Data Science Stack to Determine How Many People Have Been Killed in Syria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) uses methods from statistics and computer science to quantify mass violence. As part of that work, we rely on open source tools, including python and R, for data processing, management, analysis, and visualization. This talk will highlight how we use those tools to estimate how many people have been killed in the ongoing conflict in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;
