Designed to be extendable, JupyterLab allows developers to create new features and improve upon built-in functionality. In this session we will go over JupyterLab extensions and how they can be used to customize JupyterLab for your use case.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, significant progress has been made towards adding tools to the JupyterLab UI that will enable working interactively with such datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

But what are the most efficient practices to work with Jupyter notebooks to get the most out of this technology? In this talk Dmitry Trofimov, team lead of PyCharm IDE, will show how different tools help you solve your daily tasks using Jupyter notebooks: JupyterLab, Hydrogen plugin for Atom, VS Code, and PyCharm (all tools are open-sourced). We will discuss their pros and cons and look at them in action.&lt;/p&gt;

In bqplot, every element of a chart is an interactive widget that can be bound to a python function, which serves as the callback when an interaction takes place. This allows the user to generate full fledged interactive applications directly in the Notebook with just a few lines of Python code. In the second part of the talk, drawing examples from fields like Data Science and Finance, we show examples of building interactive charts and dashboards using bqplot and the ipywidgets framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will also cover bqplot's interaction with the new JupyterLab IDE and what we plan for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
