&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right after the introduction of PEP342 (Enhanced Generators) we started
to decompose programs into generators. It was soon discovered that for
real-life problems one would need something like &amp;quot;yield from&amp;quot;, as is
described in PEP380. At that time, we already had a similar solution
called '&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://weightless.io/compose"&gt;compose&lt;/a&gt;', which we adapted
to PEP380.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 5 years working with 'compose', we found a small set of other
features that are essential if you want to use Enhanced Generators not
only as a way of lightweight command scheduling, but also a a pipe-line,
or parser. Indeed, the latter concepts are what real co-routines are
about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces what is needed on top of PEPs 342 and 380 based on
experience with decomposing big enterprise search engines into
co-routines. Parts of it have been presented on SPA (2008) and
EuroPython (2010). Understanding of Enhanced Generators is a
prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience has shown that the topic is subtle enough to require quite
some time for full understanding, hence the suggestion for a 90 min
slot.&lt;/p&gt;
