Geospatial data comes with it’s own unique challenges—huge high dimensional datasets in weird file formats, irregular and often mismatched grids, and a pervasive lack of labeled training data… to name just a few! In this talk, we’ll explore cutting up and resampling giant remote sensing rasters using modern python tools like rasterio, georasters, and GDAL; detrending, extracting, and storing information with pandas; sensible dataset and dimensionality reduction through scipy transforms; and a few places to go in Keras and other deep learning libraries. Come learn how to jump from satellite or airborne data to your own “geoMINST” database that’s ingestible to your favorite deep learning technique!&lt;/p&gt;

unstructured data. The DBSCAN and OPTICS algorithms allow clustering and
classification of remotely-sensed points into objects; however, current
implementations have been unable to handle the data volume produced by
LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging). Using modified kd-trees as a
spatial index allows for increased scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
