&lt;p&gt;Description
At Stitch Fix most application logs are output in a structured JSON format for simpler debugging and downstream consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we‚Äôll cover in more detail why structured logs are useful and provide leverage, caveats to using them, and how simple it is to get one going with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
At Stitch Fix most application logs are output in a structured JSON format for simpler debugging and downstream consumption. For example, data scientists can add a field to their application log and it will automatically turn up as a parsed field in Elasticsearch for easy dashboarding and querying via Kibana, or be easily found and queried in Presto. In this talk we‚Äôll cover in more detail why structured logs are useful and provide leverage, caveats to using them, and how simple it is to get one going with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
