powerful climate change agent than carbon dioxide. Current technologies
for finding methane leaks in oil and gas infrastructure rely on driving
well to well with a handheld camera. At Kairos Aerospace, we have
developed a plane-mounted sensor for detecting methane leaks, but the
sensor is only part of the solution: getting information off the sensor
and into customers’ hands required us to build an entire plane-to-report
pipeline. I’ll discuss the challenges we faced in developing a scalable,
reliable, and cost-effective scientific computing platform in Python,
with examples of novel solutions using Python’s extensive ecosystem of
GIS, cloud computing and machine learning tools.&lt;/p&gt;
