Based on the history of delays in the surrounding network we can predict the future expected delay at different points in the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the excellent machine learning and deep learning tech stack of Python (Keras, TensorFlow and Pandas) I will show how to implement and train a sequence prediction model and work with time series data.&lt;/p&gt;
