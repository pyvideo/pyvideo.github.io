Simulation of course! In this talk, we will explore components of an experimentation platform through modular simulation units that provide a shockingly realistic picture user logs and wade through the pitfalls of A/B testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experimentation (A/B testing) is a hot topic in online services. While there is ample discussion around why you should test and the benefits it might bring there is a surprising lack of discussion around actually implementing or building an experimentation platform. From an engineering perspective, how do I go from a blog post on A/B testing to a full fledged platform that provides my company robust, trustworthy, and scalable experimentation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will demonstrate the power of simulating user interaction logs (written in python) as building blocks for a test driven approach to constructing various parts of an experimental platform. I will mainly focus on the aggregation of such logs into interpretable scorecards fit for non-technical consumption. I will demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of simulated logs in both reproducing real world outcomes as well as providing methods for testing unseen scenarios. I will also touch on user randomization, the pitfalls of incorrect aggregations, and provide an abstract way to think about experimentation in general. Finally, I will comment on a few of the (very public) ways that exeperimentation has been shown to fail and, with the use of simulated users, provide possible explanations for the failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to provide evidence of the usefulness of log simulation, demonstrate the very simple concepts behind building the non-operational components of an experimentation system, and hopefully impart some experimental intuitions to attendees not deeply familiar with online experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
