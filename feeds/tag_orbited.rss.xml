game for the browser? Or perhaps add chat to your website, or maybe
write a real- time financial application, collaborative text editor, or
network health monitoring app, all in the browser. Forget web
frameworks; Orbited.TCPSocket lets you communicate directly from a
browser to any network server, with any protocol you want. By tutorial's
end, every attendee will have built their own real-time data monitoring
application, or multiplayer game, from scratch using Orbited, Twisted,
and js.io.&lt;/p&gt;
