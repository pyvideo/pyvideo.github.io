the recent past and build the core of many data scientist's workplace.
Being accessed via web browser they allow scientists to easily structure
their work by combining code and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet notebooks often lead to isolated and disposable analysis artefacts.
Keeping the computation inside those notebooks does not allow for
convenient concurrent model training, model exposure or scheduled model
retraining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those issues can be addressed by taking advantage of recent developments
in the discipline of software engineering. Over the past years
containerization became the technology of choice for crafting and
deploying applications. Building a data science platform that allows for
easy access (via notebooks), flexibility and reproducibility (via
containerization) combines the best of both worlds and addresses Data
Scientist's hidden needs.&lt;/p&gt;
