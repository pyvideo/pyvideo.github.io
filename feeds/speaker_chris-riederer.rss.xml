Ideally, we could translate our questions into code as quickly as we could think! Dplython is an open source Python library (inspired by R's &amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;) that improves productivity by constraining analysis to a core set of the most common data manipulation operations. By mapping the way we think about typical tasks to functions, dplython moves data analysis closer to &amp;quot;speed-of-thought.&amp;quot; In this talk, I'll describe the core ideas behind dplython, present a tutorial on using it for data analysis, and give a technical peek at Pythonic lazy evaluations created with operator overloading.&lt;/p&gt;
