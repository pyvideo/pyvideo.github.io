Usually, we begin with
database design, then we prepare a migration system, user registration,
and all different stuff that distracts us from doing what is most
important - business logic. With the clean architecture, we can learn
how to start a project in another way and this will be one of two main
topics of my talk. The second one will be about new features in Python.
You probably heard about typings, mypy, and dataclasses, but I will show
you how they can be used in real life project that can be developed over
many years in production lifecycle. There will be no &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot; app,
no copy &amp;amp; paste of documentation, only practical knowledge learned
through many years of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
