The session will include a presentation/demonstration of some Python 3 software (available from PyPI) that I've developed for this purpose. My main interest is in oceanographic data so that will be the focus of the talk (though any environmental data could be used). The talk will cover the increased availability of environmental data via the Internet, the suitability of Python for accessing and processing the data, and using the Bokeh library for displaying the data. Bokeh allows for excellent interactive displays in a web browser driven by Python, and the talk will focus on the benefits I think this provides.&lt;/p&gt;
