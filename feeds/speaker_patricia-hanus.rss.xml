scikit learn, and matplotlib, you’ll predict whether a movie is likely
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://oscarpredictor.github.io/"&gt;win an Oscar&lt;/a&gt; or be a box office hit. We’ll step through the
creation of an effective dataset: asking a question your data can
answer, writing a web scraper, and answering those questions using
nothing but Python libraries and data from the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

A Data Driven Look at Conflicting Attitudes Towards Commenting</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/scipy-2019/to-comment-or-not-to-comment-a-data-driven-look-at-conflicting-attitudes-towards-commenting.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many agree commenting is essential for maintainable code, it’s difficult for someone who hasn’t yet worked in a community-reviewed codebase to implement best practice. Commenting questions often bring conflicting answers: Code should be DRY, but well-placed comments save future devs. How can someone find the commenting style that is best for them as they learn, grow, &amp;amp; contribute? My survey of 130 developers, CS majors, bootcamp grads, &amp;amp; hobbyists confirms some expectations and brings others into question. Join me for a data-based chat about the experiences of growing developers and the steps we can take to encourage a growth mindset in developers at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;
