The Django framework is quite well known. It is a extremely quick and easy way to develop web sites and apps. Backed by strong developer community and wealth of knowledge available online, it is natural first choice for web-development. But in this case, we use it as an excellent web-app back-end which we drive a mobile front-end.
Sencha is fast becoming an important framework for developing mobile apps which runs elegantly on both Android and iPhone. With almost native API like look and feel, it works like a charm on Android and iPhone platform reducing development time dramatically.
I will try to address the classic problem of disconnect between mobile and web-apps. Putting the system of producing both within single development cycle. Using django-piston as center piece library. We will use extensively to create well defined APIs. These APIs will in turn be used with Sencha based front-ends.
Extending further we will take a look at integration testing of this framework towards creating a rock solid mobile experience. This will be followed by discussion on merits of using browser over native app frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

In a model-view-controller world, Enaml makes it very easy to develop the view and controller. Typically, the model is built with Traits, but it's model is framework agnostic and provides hooks for using custom model frameworks.
The DSL is a strict superset of Python and provides a simple Pythonic syntax for declaring a UI that binds and reacts to changes in the models. Enaml is dynamically executed and it lets you bind to arbitrary Python expressions. It uses a constraint based layout system which makes it possible to have layouts that are not typically possible with traditional UI toolkits. Enaml also supports asynchronous UIs which allow one to have multiple UIs connecting to the same model running in the same process or out of process. This, in theory, opens up the possibility for a web-based UI to be used to control a model.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a mostly Java application. One component of the application is the Liveweb proxy. This is an HTTP proxy that archives a resource which is requested through it and the core data source for the wayback machine.
The liveweb proxy was rearchitected from scratch in Python and deployed on the actual website and has been running for a few months now without a single hitch. There were limitations in the standard library which needed to be worked around, careful tuning of parameters to balance disk I/O and memory usage, fine details of the HTTP protocol that needed to be understood and respected.
This talk discusses the architecture and design of the new system to handle the kind of traffic and patterns which are expected of an archiving proxy and how it was deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

Writing programs to solve puzzles is even more fun. Doing it is not so trivial. It requires choosing right data structures, algorithms and a bit of smartness.
This tutorial presents Python's powerful constructs like list comprehensions, generators, generator expressions and ideas from functional programming world to write programs to solve puzzles.
I'm planning to cover:
-8 queens puzzle
-sudoku
-and more if time permits&lt;/p&gt;
