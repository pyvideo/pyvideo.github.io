over the last decade it has grown into a rich and powerful set of
interlocking tools aimed at enabling an efficient, fluid and productive
workflow in the typical use cases encountered by scientists in everyday
research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, IPython consists of a kernel executing user code and capable of
communicating with a variety of clients, using ZeroMQ for networking via
a well-documented protocol. This enables IPython to support, from a
single codebase, a rich variety of usage scenarios through user-facing
applications and an API for embedding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An interactive, terminal-based shell with many capabilities far
beyond the default Python interactive interpreter (this is the
default application opened by the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ipython&lt;/tt&gt; command that most users
are familiar with).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Qt console that provides the look and feel of a terminal, but adds
support for inline figures, graphical calltips, a persistent session
that can survive crashes of the kernel process, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A web-based notebook that can execute code and also contain rich text
and figures, mathematical equations and arbitrary HTML. This notebook
presents a document-like view with cells where code is executed but
that can be edited in-place, reordered, mixed with explanatory text
and figures, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high-performance, low-latency system for parallel computing that
supports the control of a cluster of IPython engines communicating
over ZeroMQ, with optimizations that minimize unnecessary copying of
large objects (especially numpy arrays).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will show how IPython supports all stages in the
lifecycle of a scientific idea: individual exploration, collaborative
development, large- scale production using parallel resources,
publication and education. In particular, the IPython Notebook supports
multiuser collaboration and allows scientists to share their work in an
open document format that is a true &amp;quot;executable paper&amp;quot;: notebooks can be
version controlled, exported to HTML or PDF for publication, and used
for teaching. We will demonstrate the key features of the system,&lt;/p&gt;

of a collaboration with UW and NYU funded by the Moore and Sloan
Foundations. It will be a space for the open and interdisciplinary work
that is typical of the SciPy community. In the creation of BIDS, the
role of open source scientific tools for Data Science, and specifically
the SciPy ecosystem, played an important role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the Gordon and Betty Moore and the Alfred P. Sloan foundations
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery/data-science-environments"&gt;awarded&lt;/a&gt;
UC Berkeley, U. Washington and NYU for a collaborative, $38M in support
of a 5-year initiative to create novel environments for Data Science.
This project was driven by the recognition that computing and data
analysis have now become the backbone of all scientific research, and
yet the teams, collaborations and individuals that make this possible
typically encounter significant barriers in today's academic
environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SciPy community is one of the poster children of this issue: many of
our members live &amp;quot;officially&amp;quot; in traditional, discipline-oriented
scientific research, and yet we have committed time and effort to
creating an open ecosystem of tools for research. As we all know, this
is often done with little support from the standard incentive structures
of science, be it publication venues, funding agencies or hiring, tenure
and promotion committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of this initiative is an important moment, as it signals the
recognition of this problem by important and well-respected foundations
in science. At UC Berkeley, we took this opportunity to create the new
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/datascience/bids-launch-dec-12"&gt;Berkeley Institute for Data
Science&lt;/a&gt;.
In this effort, the open source tools of the SciPy community will play a
central role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will describe the larger context in which this
initiative has been created, as well as the scientific scope of our
team, our goals, and the opportunities that we will try to provide with
this space. We expect that this new institute, together with our
partners at UW and NYU, will play an important role in support of the
great work of the SciPy ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

focusing on the positive impact that Open Source tools and ideas, and
the Python community in particular, have had on the world of science.
Scientific research is at a crossroads, under increasing pressure to
justify itself to society at large and with very real questions being
asked about the reproducibility of scientific results and access to the
products of science. The Open Source community have created both
technical and cultural solutions to similar problems that we as
scientists can learn from. The Python language has also made major
inroads into research and education, helping foster a culture of better
computational research and opening up a space for a lot of creativity at
the intersection of science and computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando Pérez is a research scientist at UC Berkeley, working at the
intersection of high-level scientific computing with open tools and
brain imaging. He started the IPython project in 2001, while a graduate
student in Physics at CU Boulder. He continues to lead a talented team
(who do all the hard work) to develop IPython as the interface between
the humans at the keyboard and the bits in the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a founding member of NumFOCUS, a PSF member, and received the 2012
Award for the Advancement of Free Software for IPython and his
contributions to scientific Python. He is a founding investigator of the
Berkeley Institute for Data Science, created in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he can get away from a computer, Fernando tries to enjoy the
mountains and the outdoors hiking, backpacking and climbing. For more
