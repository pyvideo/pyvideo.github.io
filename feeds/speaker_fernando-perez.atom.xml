We discussed that transition in a separate talk - here I would like to reflect from a personal perspective on a few aspects of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this transition, I stepped down as &amp;quot;project BDFL&amp;quot;. This was a decision driven by many reasons; among others, I think the context of open source communities today is radically different from 20 years ago, and our view with Jupyter is centered around a multi-stakeholder community, where no single actor should concentrate too much authority. From day one, IPython, then Jupyter, were collaborative efforts. Many people put in their ideas, code, feedback and energy to create something we can all collectively own, adapt for our needs, and extend in new directions. While it's necessary to build a sense of vision and direction for any project to be successful in the long run, a &amp;quot;dictator&amp;quot; is entirely the wrong metaphor to base that work on. Python itself has moved on from that model, and we hope more projects will continue to find better ways to harness the energy of their entire community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space where Jupyter exists today is challenging: we have had phenomenal success on many fronts. From users of Juptyer itself to those who build on our foundations, standards and protocols in new directions, the impact of the project goes far beyond our original hopes and expectations. But, as well stated in the classic Innovator's dilemma, this type of large-scale success is itself a potential trap. While not a commercial entity, Jupyter still needs to provide value to all of its stakeholders, with the added challenge that its own strategic directions are not decided by any single actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conference is an opportunity to learn from each other on both what has worked so far, and how the next decade will be very different. If we are to continue providing value, these are some of the challenges I hope we'll tackle together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter beyond the &amp;quot;Global North&amp;quot;: Jupyter should be a tool for democratizing access to science and education, but in a way that empowers all to participate, not only to access and consume. This means we need to continue growing our community of developers, contributors and leaders in countries beyond those most traditionally represented (which for Jupyter, is highly concentrated in the US and Europe). Important efforts have made progress on this front already, but we should make it a priority to build culturally-relevant, contextually appropriate spaces for local communities to develop new tools and use cases, as well as contributing back into the main project.
AI: as of this writing, 2022 is shaping up as a watershed year in AI, with advances like ChatGPT causing ripples in the industry and even general media. These tools open a new front on the idea of &amp;quot;interactive conversations with humans and the computer&amp;quot; that Jupyter has already explored. They also tend to be developed and controlled by a few large and powerful corporations. Jupyter should explore its own version of how to ensure these tools can empower everyone, while innovating with use cases that capitalize on our architecture.
What are the layers of the &amp;quot;core of Jupyter&amp;quot; that its stakeholders should agree upon, and continue building as 100% open-source, vendor-independent technology, while so many of these stakeholders have their own business goals? These goals often depend on Jupyter-based products, so there is an inherent tension between what goes into the &amp;quot;Jupyter commons&amp;quot; and what is the value added by a specific vendor. Rather than wishing this tension away, we should recognize it and work productively within these constraints.
To explore these and related questions, we should reflect on identifying the scope of Jupyter - Jupyter tools cover many different aspects of computing, yet there's a common theme. I'll present my own take on this, informed by my interactions with many of you for 20+ years, in the hope that it can lead to useful conversations for our next period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this talk will be a useful point of reference for some of the ideas that the project has built so far, but focused on thinking of the future. While I will discuss them from my limited, personal perspective, my goal is to motivate thinking at the strategic, community and technical levels.&lt;/p&gt;

focusing on the positive impact that Open Source tools and ideas, and
the Python community in particular, have had on the world of science.
Scientific research is at a crossroads, under increasing pressure to
justify itself to society at large and with very real questions being
asked about the reproducibility of scientific results and access to the
products of science. The Open Source community have created both
technical and cultural solutions to similar problems that we as
scientists can learn from. The Python language has also made major
inroads into research and education, helping foster a culture of better
computational research and opening up a space for a lot of creativity at
the intersection of science and computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando Pérez is a research scientist at UC Berkeley, working at the
intersection of high-level scientific computing with open tools and
brain imaging. He started the IPython project in 2001, while a graduate
student in Physics at CU Boulder. He continues to lead a talented team
(who do all the hard work) to develop IPython as the interface between
the humans at the keyboard and the bits in the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a founding member of NumFOCUS, a PSF member, and received the 2012
Award for the Advancement of Free Software for IPython and his
contributions to scientific Python. He is a founding investigator of the
Berkeley Institute for Data Science, created in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he can get away from a computer, Fernando tries to enjoy the
mountains and the outdoors hiking, backpacking and climbing. For more

over the last decade it has grown into a rich and powerful set of
interlocking tools aimed at enabling an efficient, fluid and productive
workflow in the typical use cases encountered by scientists in everyday
research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, IPython consists of a kernel executing user code and capable of
communicating with a variety of clients, using ZeroMQ for networking via
a well-documented protocol. This enables IPython to support, from a
single codebase, a rich variety of usage scenarios through user-facing
applications and an API for embedding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An interactive, terminal-based shell with many capabilities far
beyond the default Python interactive interpreter (this is the
default application opened by the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ipython&lt;/tt&gt; command that most users
are familiar with).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Qt console that provides the look and feel of a terminal, but adds
support for inline figures, graphical calltips, a persistent session
that can survive crashes of the kernel process, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A web-based notebook that can execute code and also contain rich text
and figures, mathematical equations and arbitrary HTML. This notebook
presents a document-like view with cells where code is executed but
that can be edited in-place, reordered, mixed with explanatory text
and figures, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high-performance, low-latency system for parallel computing that
supports the control of a cluster of IPython engines communicating
over ZeroMQ, with optimizations that minimize unnecessary copying of
large objects (especially numpy arrays).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will show how IPython supports all stages in the
lifecycle of a scientific idea: individual exploration, collaborative
development, large- scale production using parallel resources,
publication and education. In particular, the IPython Notebook supports
multiuser collaboration and allows scientists to share their work in an
open document format that is a true &amp;quot;executable paper&amp;quot;: notebooks can be
version controlled, exported to HTML or PDF for publication, and used
for teaching. We will demonstrate the key features of the system,&lt;/p&gt;

that is typical of the SciPy community. In the creation of BIDS, the
role of open source scientific tools for Data Science, and specifically
the SciPy ecosystem, played an important role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the Gordon and Betty Moore and the Alfred P. Sloan foundations
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.moore.org/programs/science/data-driven-discovery/data-science-environments"&gt;awarded&lt;/a&gt;
UC Berkeley, U. Washington and NYU for a collaborative, $38M in support
of a 5-year initiative to create novel environments for Data Science.
This project was driven by the recognition that computing and data
analysis have now become the backbone of all scientific research, and
yet the teams, collaborations and individuals that make this possible
typically encounter significant barriers in today's academic
environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SciPy community is one of the poster children of this issue: many of
our members live &amp;quot;officially&amp;quot; in traditional, discipline-oriented
scientific research, and yet we have committed time and effort to
creating an open ecosystem of tools for research. As we all know, this
is often done with little support from the standard incentive structures
of science, be it publication venues, funding agencies or hiring, tenure
and promotion committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of this initiative is an important moment, as it signals the
recognition of this problem by important and well-respected foundations
in science. At UC Berkeley, we took this opportunity to create the new
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/datascience/bids-launch-dec-12"&gt;Berkeley Institute for Data
Science&lt;/a&gt;.
In this effort, the open source tools of the SciPy community will play a
central role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will describe the larger context in which this
initiative has been created, as well as the scientific scope of our
team, our goals, and the opportunities that we will try to provide with
this space. We expect that this new institute, together with our
partners at UW and NYU, will play an important role in support of the
great work of the SciPy ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

This is probably a good time to reflect not only on these successes, but also on what the new strategic challenges are ahead of us. We don't need to argue about &amp;amp;quot;why open source&amp;amp;quot; at conferences and grant proposals anymore. But do we have the right funding models, career paths, models for interaction with industry, educational integration, etc? Is our community on the right track to grow and diversify in a sustainable way? I'll try to reflect on some of these issues and propose some starting points for both conversation and action.
