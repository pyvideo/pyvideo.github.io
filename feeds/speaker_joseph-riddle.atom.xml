Keeping it running month after month is even harder. As a Python User Group organizer, I've had my fair share of mess ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll examine some ways _not_ to run your own Python User Group based on my own experiences as an organizer. By looking back at my own missteps, we'll determine some best practices for getting your own User Group off the ground. By the end of the talk, you'll be well equipped to run your User Group long-term. Come laugh and learn as we journey through my meetup misadventures and prepare you for your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All levels of Python experience are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
