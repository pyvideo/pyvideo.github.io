In modern times, we are already able to just build the whole complex pipelines and deploy applications directly on the cloud, without &amp;quot;cutting&amp;quot; it to separate instances. And you may don't even care how and where things are going to be executed. It's just several lines of code and no more non-trivial maintenance and deployment, just pure business logic. Magic? No, it's serverless.&lt;/p&gt;
