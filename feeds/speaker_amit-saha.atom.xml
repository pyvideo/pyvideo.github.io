The talk aims to highlight how Python is the perfect programming language to make programming more fun and immediately applicable to young learners. By making use of standard library modules such as the fractions module, third party packages such as matplotlib and sympy, the audience will learn how to write programs to solve common math problems. Some of the topics that will be discussed are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulating uniform and non-uniform random events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawing Fractals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solving algebraic equations and inequalities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solving calculus problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to get you started on the monitoring journey in Python. In addition to clearing up some of the jargon, we will look at &lt;cite&gt;statsd&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;prometheus&lt;/cite&gt; monitoring systems and how to integrate our applications with these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the numbers, we are really flying blind!&lt;/p&gt;

Middleware is often simply brought in to an application's code base, without perhaps a thorough understanding of how they work. This talk will shed light on how middleware components work in popular Python web frameworks - Flask, Django and FastAPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with that understanding, you will learn how to write your own middleware as well as use standard community contributed middleware to implement vital functionality in your applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will discuss the next steps after you have written a web application. Python frameworks and libraries makes it really easy to write a highly performant web application out of the box, but the problems that come next needs a number of building blocks and tools to come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will talk about deploying your web application and discuss scaling up and down policies so that we can cater to peak traffic demands. We will discuss how we can peek into our application’s performance by exporting “health” status and metrics, and learn about implementing distributed tracing into our web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as possible, the talk will discuss generic strategies, only using specific tools/software for hands-on examples.&lt;/p&gt;
