The goal is to develop an intuition-first understanding of common graph algorithms.
Target audience is primarily programmers who want to review, or better understand graph algorithms.
I will show how to convert mazes, social networks, and maps in to graphs. I will also cover eight algorithms- BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Hierholzer's, articulation points, centrality, Kruskal's algorithm, and the Louvain method. I will also provide practical (as practical as D&amp;amp;D can get) applications for these algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
