alternate side of the street parking regulations. This means most nights I
need to move my car before the early morning street cleaning that happens in
my neighborhood. I had developed a nightly routine around moving my car
before I go to bed. I am sometimes a bit too good at this and I often move
my car on days I don’t need to. Since alternate side of the street parking
is often canceled on days where there are holidays, or bad weather, there is
a Twitter handle &amp;#64;NYCASP, which posts daily and whenever there is an
emergency situation. I used Python, Twilio and the Twitter API to solve this
problem for myself so I get a text message whenever I don't need to move my car.&lt;/p&gt;
