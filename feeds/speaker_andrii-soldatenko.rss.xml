&lt;p&gt;Compare full text search engines for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays we can see lot’s of benchmarks and performance tests of
different web frameworks and Python tools. Regarding to search
engines, it’s difficult to find useful information especially
benchmarks or comparing between different search engines. It’s
difficult to manage what search engine you should select for instance,
ElasticSearch, Postgres Full Text Search or may be Sphinx or Whoosh.
You face a difficult choice, that’s why I am pleased to share with you
my acquired experience and benchmarks and focus on how to compare full
text search engines for Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, when it comes to debugging asynchronous applications in python, we have a couple of options to consider. The writers of the asyncio module have very kindly provided a debug mode, which is quite powerful and can really aid us in our debugging adventures without the overhead of modifying the system's code base too dramatically. In particular, I'll show you what asyncio debug mode means for developers, and how to source tracebacks for unhandled exceptions in futures. Also how to detect accidental blocking for I/O. We discuss how to monitor the asyncio event loop and collect metrics in statsD.
Finally, we discuss monitor and cli capabilities for asyncio applications based on aiomonitor and aioconsole. Also, we discuss how asynchronous python works in REPL via autoawait based on ipython and how to do it in vanilla python REPL.&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is very simple given well-known computer science problems, solve them as quickly as possible. From another point, these challenges have been used frequently in the initial coding interview tasks. Usually all participants uses C/C++/Java, but last decade we can see increasing trend of contestants who uses Python in programming challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I’ll show you how to start compete using Python, I’ll share couple personal tips &amp;amp; tricks how to prepare and start to take part into programming contests using Python. I’ll show you how to motivate yourself to practice and how to define of class of problem and how to try to solve it. I’ll demonstrate you some limits of Python and how to avoid it to make correct and fast solutions. I’ll discuss with you how to master the art of testing and how to crack and generate hidden test cases and boundaries. Also I’ll explain how to quickly estimate complexity of you solution, without too many proofs and math to get desired AC (Accepted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a long time to become a good competitive programmer, but it is also an opportunity to learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently the interest in asynchronous programming has grown
dramatically. Unfortunately, asynchronous programs do not always have
reproducible behavior. Even when they are run with the same inputs,
their results can be radically different. In this talk I’ll show you
different approaches on how to debug asynchronous programs in Python.
Luckily, when it comes to debugging asynchronous applications in python,
we have a couple of options to consider. The writers of the asyncio
module have very kindly provided a debug mode, which is quite powerful
and can really aid us in our debugging adventures without the overhead
of modifying the system’s code base too dramatically. In particular I’ll
show you what asyncio debug mode means for developers, and how to source
tracebacks for unhandled exceptions in futures. Also how to detect
accidental blocking for I/O. We discuss how to monitor the asyncio event

We have lot’s of social applications that we are using every day, let’s say Facebook, twitter, Instagram. Lot’s of such kind apps based on social graph and graph theory. I would like to share my knowledge and expertise about how to work with graphs and build large social graph as engine for Social network using python and Graph databases. We'll compare SQL and NoSQL approaches for friends relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
