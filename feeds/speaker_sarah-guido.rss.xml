dealing with data is neat, tidy, and simple. They present you with a
simplistic dataset and the scikit-learn or Pandas documentation, and a
day or so later, you're done! Piece of cake, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real world of data isn't that easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a data scientist who has worked in the industry for several years, I
have had a lot of experience dealing with messy, inaccurate, incomplete
data, and I want to share those experiences with you. I'll talk my way
through three real-world situations where I've had to analyze and build
models on untidy and complex data, going through how I've preprocessed
the data and prepared it for modeling. You'll leave with an
understanding of how a data scientist thinks about data and what she
does when the data is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale data analysis is complicated. There’s a limit to how much data you can analyze on a single box, but it is relatively inexpensive to get access to a large number of commodity servers. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to leverage the power of distributed computing tools to do large-scale data analysis quickly and affordably using pure Python, Hadoop MapReduce, and Apache Spark.&lt;/p&gt;

However, it can be difficult to figure out which tools are good to use.
In this workshop, we’ll work through in-depth examples of tools for data
wrangling, machine learning, and data visualization. I’ll show you how
to work through a data analysis workflow, and how to deal with different
kinds of data.&lt;/p&gt;

hashtags, followers, retweets, and replies. Using the network analysis
tool NetworkX, we'll look at how to make sense of these channels. We'll
cover the basics of network theory, including types of networks and how
measure influence, and we'll apply those measures to our investigation
of Twitter's network.&lt;/p&gt;
