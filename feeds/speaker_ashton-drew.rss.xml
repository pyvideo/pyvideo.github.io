graphics. The focus will be on R Shiny, but I will also summarize
value of other options, such as leaflet, plotly, ggvis, and rCharts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With interactive and reactive data visualizations, your audience
directly engages with your data for stronger communication and better
understanding. The Shiny apps can easily be launched directly to the
web via shinyapps.io or Shiny Server to be run by anyone (they don't
need to download your data or have R). This course assumes
participants can already perform data analysis and visualization in R,
but want to expand their skills with R Shiny. Therefore, the class
exercises focus on transcribing code from a static to an interactive
presentation of data products and information. Students must bring
their own laptop with a current version of R and R Studio. Outline: -
Overview of available interactive tools in R - Exercise to build a
simple Shiny app - Shiny setup and orientation - Introduction to Shiny
code structure - Overview of basic widgets - Example of conditional
reactivity&lt;/p&gt;
