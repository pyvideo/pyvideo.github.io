&lt;p&gt;Carousel is an extensible framework for mathematical models that handles generic routines such as loading and saving data, generating reports, converting units, propagating uncertainty and running simulations so developers can focus on creating complex algorithms that are easy to share and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematical models consist of algorithms glued together with generic routines. While the algorithms may sometimes be unique and complex, the rest of the code is often simple and routine. Sometimes mathematical models developed by teams of developers over time become difficult to update because there is no framework for how new data, calculations and outputs are integrated into the existing models. Carousel allows developers to focus on creating complex mathematical models that are robust and easy to maintain by abstracting generic routines and establishing a simple but extensible framework.&lt;/p&gt;
