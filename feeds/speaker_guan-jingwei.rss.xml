Super
resolution is a technique which serve low- resolution image as input and
outputs high-resolution images. How to preserve edges and restore detail
information in the high-resolution image is very important. In this
talk, we will discuss the developments of super resolution, especially
methods using deep learning where pytorch is used during training.&lt;/p&gt;
