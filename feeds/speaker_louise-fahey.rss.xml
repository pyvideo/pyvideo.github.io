debt in our documentation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As technical communicators, it’s very easy to get caught up in the cycle
of moving from one release to another without taking time to refine what
already exists. Trying to keep up with documenting new features means we
often find ourselves navigating though outdated and disused
stylesheets/labels/files/content/junk in projects that we inherited from
technical communicators before us and haven’t had the time to clean up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds familiar, then this presentation is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It aims to help you tackle the daunting task of cleaning up your project
and getting rid of technical debt once and for all. We will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is technical debt, how does it accrue, and why should your
organisation care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you can tackle your debt and give your documentation project the
spring clean it needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tips for staying debt‐free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
