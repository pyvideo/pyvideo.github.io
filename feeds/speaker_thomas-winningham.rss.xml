late 80's in the parking lot of a Rax Roast Beef restaurant for $20.
This started a nostalgic journey assisted by NumPy matrix slices and a
can of WD-40. This talk will cover how I used Python to overcome three
decades of history to get it printing again.&lt;/p&gt;

non-linear editor format, but as large collections of image sequences in
folders. Using Python to produce video this way can be very simple and
natural once you starting thinking in image sequences. Using a series of
small scripts, I'll demonstrate using PyCairo or PySVG as well as
ImageMagick and FFMPEG to make 1080P HD video.&lt;/p&gt;

TV DVB standard. It was discovered it can also be a general purpose
radio receiver and spectrum analyzer. We will evaluate these devices by
listening to broadcast FM or emergency frequencies, and demonstrate an
original open source Python library I wrote for them.&lt;/p&gt;
