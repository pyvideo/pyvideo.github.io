While this process was acceptable years ago, with the advances in the computer science and evolution of unstructured databases we can expect to receive something more robust than a digital version of the (train, bus, …) timetable, something that provide us with the expected delays based on the current situation (weather, temperature, events,…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I show you how I’ve used python to create a database for various parameters impacting transportation delays using web scrapping and how using Neo4j, I’ve created a transportations network which is used for finding the best path based on transportation times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics: - Scrapping and data storage (structures and Unstructured): Getting weather, temperature, local events, planned maintenances and saving them in MongoDB and SQL databases - Creating a Neo4j database: Mapping the actual connections between transportation means - Finding the best path: using Dijkstra and A* algorithms to find the best paths, minimizing the travel time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level of expected Audience: Basic knowledge of Python and databases&lt;/p&gt;
