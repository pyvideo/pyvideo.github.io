are new to supervised learning. Check out the code for this talk on my
GitHub profile to see if you'll find it interesting:
github.com/halidebey/PyCon2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be working with a dataset of tweets and aiming to accurately
categorize each tweet as relevant or irrelevant for the police using
Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I'm going through a live demo of the data cleaning process &amp;amp;
analysis, I will (quickly) cover some machine learning concepts. To make
the talk a bit more interactive, I recommend that attendees come with
their (charged) laptops and go through the code during the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
