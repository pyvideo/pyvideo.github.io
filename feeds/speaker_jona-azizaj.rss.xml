relatively small city of Tirana, the capital of Albania. Even fewer
girls were interested in Python. During our talk we will share the
story of how we, a small but dedicated group of people, jump started
the community in a small country like Albania and what other small
cities and countries should avoid during their first steps in
developing a Python community in similar conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important we will share tips and tricks on how to keep the
Python spirit alive for a long time after the first enthusiastic
steps, with the goal that our shared experience will help other
communities to make the first steps or grow even further. Also
nowadays we are witnessing that the number of girls involved in
technical fields, especially development, is really low and we are
going to present what as the influence on low participation of girls
and the steps we should take to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
