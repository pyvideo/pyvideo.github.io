&lt;p&gt;A lot of people want to use Python, but their customer, management,
school, government, or organization won't let them. Python is a great
tool, but it can be challenging to get in the door. This panel will
explore how companies and individuals have successfully introduced
Python, what tools are available to sell Python, and what pitfalls there
are to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible questions will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a good example success story you can share?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What pitfalls should you avoid?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you deal with organizations that have already spent
bucketloads of money on a piss-poor technology stack, are hurting for
it, but can't seem to let go?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you fight Fear-Uncertainty-Doubt (FUD) spread by people who
stand to lose from introducing Python?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What tools are available to help sell Python?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five panelists will be chosen from a broad spectrum of individuals
including academic, government, for-profit organizations, and non-profit
organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
