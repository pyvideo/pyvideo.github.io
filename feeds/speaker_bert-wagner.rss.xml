your remote work life: speed of network data transfer. It doesn't matter
if you can write the most efficient Python data transformation code when
your jobs are bottlenecked by slow data movement happening between your
local laptop and remote servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will address techniques for querying and joining data
across distant machines efficiently with Python. We will also discuss
how to handle scenarios where you need to join datasets that won't fit
in your laptop's memory, including several techniques and packages for
making cross server joins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session won't stop you from getting angry when your ISP throttles
your home internet connection, but it will teach you ways to work with
local and remote datasets as efficiently as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
