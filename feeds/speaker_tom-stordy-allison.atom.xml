&lt;p&gt;Enaml is an open source library for building rich user interfaces utilizing a declarative extension to the Python language grammar. The Enaml DSL is a strict superset of Python allowing developers to declaratively define dynamic user interface hierarchies. Notable features of the framework include: automatic data binding dependency analysis, a cassowary constraint based layout system, and support for multiple model change notification systems (and asynchronous bindings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enaml has been used for building production Python applications at J.P. Morgan for several years. This talk will provide a brief introduction to the language, cover some of the notable features, and also look at some of the features that J.P. Morgan have been adding to the language.&lt;/p&gt;
