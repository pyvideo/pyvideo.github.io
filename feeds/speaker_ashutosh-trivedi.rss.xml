&lt;p&gt;Ever Imagined if your algorithm is able to solve the classic Odd Man Out problems for you, or solving Analogy problems? Well, thats not impossible provided you have large data. Consider how our brain solve these problems- If we have not seen the words asked in the puzzle we can not solve such problems. We need contextual information about the words. Also, if you notice carefully both the problems are somewhat similar and only require your memory or precisely how you store contextual information.&lt;/p&gt;
