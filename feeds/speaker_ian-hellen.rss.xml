For threat hunting and incident investigations, notebooks give you flexibility not found in most &lt;em&gt;Security Operations Center&lt;/em&gt; (SOC) toolsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, threat hunting requires specialized tools, analytics and visualizations that aren't part of the typical data science libraries. We'll show some of the features of the &lt;strong&gt;MSTICPy&lt;/strong&gt; CyberTools library that we built to address these gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of the talk will be on Python techniques (incl code examples) that we used to build extensible and discoverable tools for large-scale CyberSec operations. The techniques are applicable to many fields - no previous cybersecurity knowledge is required to watch the talk or use the techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overview:
- What's the appeal of notebooks in SOCs? and what is missing?
- Making data querying/acquisition simple - creating dynamic functions from config.
- Data enrichment: getting more context on IP Address, Hosts, etc. - using decorators to create a consistent API.
- Visualizations - quick tour of MSTICPy visualizations using &lt;em&gt;pandas&lt;/em&gt; accessors and &lt;strong&gt;Bokeh&lt;/strong&gt;.
- Composability - assembling multiple operations into a &lt;em&gt;pandas&lt;/em&gt; execution pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
