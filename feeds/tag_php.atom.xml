&lt;p&gt;They are experiences that have been replayed hundreds of thousands of times by other novice programmers, and there are some valuable lessons to be learned for us in the Python community: 'our' language may be more elegant, secure and powerful, but there's a reason why, all the same, there are more PHP programmers and more PHP on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a mistake to make PHP the butt of jokes, or worse still, to think scornfully of the legions of not-very-expert PHP programmers who have found themselves empowered by things like WordPress. They donâ€™t deserve it, for a start, but it's harmful for us too, because it hides from us the things that have rightfully brought success to PHP and its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll highlight some of the ways in which the Python community has taken note of these lessons, and recent developments that might help Python catch up with PHP's legendary successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Alex Ezell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Emma, we are transforming an eight year old PHP codebase into an
API-driven service written in Python. Facing down the triple threat of
bad data, encoding issues, and a generation of code cruft, we've begun
to see the light of day. Come hear how we did it, where we fell down and
where we're succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
