thankfully, we are in the grips of a technical revolution and it may
surprise you how much of this technology has had a massive impact on my
life and enabled my independence to be greatly improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My love of technology has helped me to embrace many things from social
networking to smart assistants to improve my life including, in my
professional work where I use a Python library to partially code by
using my voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will discuss the label of assistive technology and why
more technologies than you would traditionally think in my view are
assistive. I will also discuss the risks forced upon me to achieve that
level of independence and where I believe the technology of the future
has a role to play in further increasing my independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom is a Computing student at Bournemouth University in South West
England. Despite being born with Quadriplegic Cerebral Palsy he has used
his love and passion for technology to propel himself forward, grounded
in a firm interest of current affairs and the world around him. Tom is
currently looking for opportunities to combine both of these passions.&lt;/p&gt;
