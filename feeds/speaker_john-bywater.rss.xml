&lt;p&gt;Events are fundamental to the reality we inhabit. We can benefit from
paying attention to the events in the human processes we support with
our software, in our software development processes, and in the software
systems we develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By understanding process as the production of events, we can more
directly develop software systems that are reliable and maintainable.
With the same understanding we can more easily develop effective human
processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With code examples from the Python eventsourcing library, arguments from
Alfred North Whitehead, the event storming method, gently contrasted
with your typical Dark Agile CRUD project....&lt;/p&gt;
