This was later switching for Go, but why? This talk will cover mocker, a container runtime Anthony wrote to understand Docker by rewriting its basic functions in 100% Python. Anthony will walk through how to write a Docker daemon in Python whilst applying it to real problems. Whilst the tool might not be production ready, it demonstrates some patterns, libraries and ideas for working with Docker containers from Python.&lt;/p&gt;

evolves over time, requirements change and codebases can get messy and
complicated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you will learn how to use &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;wily&lt;/tt&gt; to measure and graph
how complicated your Python code is and a series of practical techniques
to simplify it. &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;wily&lt;/tt&gt; will show you which parts of your projects are
becoming or have become hard to maintain and need a refactor. Once you
know where the skeletons are, you will learn practical techniques for
refactoring &amp;quot;complex&amp;quot; code and some resources to use to take your
refactoring to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

This project was started 5 years ago but stopped after making no gains in performance. Recent changes to CPython have made optimisations more viable, so now it has been restarted and is showing big performance gains vs. standard CPython with 100% compatibility. Many attempts have been made to build a general purpose JIT for Python and few have succeeded. Is it worth it and what are the gains to be made? This talk will cover the design ideas of a JIT for CPython, optimisations, and future potential.&lt;/p&gt;

interpreters&amp;quot; that uses a per-interpreter GIL to unlock a new way of
writing parallel code that's faster than multiprocessing. Python 3.13
introduces another new parallel execution model called &amp;quot;free-threading&amp;quot;
(previously called &lt;em&gt;no-gil&lt;/em&gt;) that replaces that optionally removes the
GIL so that threads can truly be parallel. Does free-threading make sub
interpreters redundant? We'll answer that question in this talk. We
unpack what sub interpreters are, how to use them and their limitations.
We'll explore free-threading, the optional flag to remove the GIL in
3.13. Finally we look at a use case for sub interpreters &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;
free-threading together, a multi-worker, multi-thread ASGI web server.
We benchmark this against traditional web server architecture with
multiprocessing and threading. So fasten your seatbelts, fellow
Pythonistas! Let’s ride the comet tail of parallelism, leaving behind
the single-threaded past. 🚀✨&lt;/p&gt;
