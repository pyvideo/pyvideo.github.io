&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take care of the most important thing, your psychophysical well-being,
and be efficient about it. You don’t need to be hungry (well, just a
little bit), do lots of exercise (well, just a little bit) and spend a
lot of time and money (well, just a little bit… uhm, there seems to be a
pattern :-) ). You just need to take care of your body using the same
thing that lets you program computers: your mind. No, the human body is
not “a machine”, as it’s often said: it’s much more complex than that.
Nonetheless, knowledge of a few facts, some guiding principles, and some
tech tools (we’re geeks after all, aren’t we? :-) ) can definitely
improve your life. Warning: this speaker is not a doctor, and this talk
is not medical advice. Get the advice of a qualified doctor/physician
before changing your diet and/or your physical regimen. Neither this
speaker nor the conference organization will be liable for any injuries
or illnesses you may incur by however applying the concepts discussed in
this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
