&lt;p&gt;What would it be if the computer could accompany human automatically?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automatic accompaniment is a research topic which is proposed 35 years ago. Nowadays, this is still a very attractive topic. e.g. a musician plays the main melody of &amp;quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&amp;quot;; the computer performs the accompaniment part adapt for the musician's tempo. That is to say, the system must be able to &amp;quot;listen to&amp;quot; musician in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will share the topic background, problem definition, the approaches I tried, and show the accompaniment result with a performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an entry-level session, everyone is welcome to attend. It will be better if you are interested in music tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Szu-Yueh pursues theory and engineering balanced lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He embraces complexity and uncertainty that is why he likes the probabilistic model more than the deterministic model.
He loves to be a creator that is why the generative model is more interesting to him than the discriminative model.&lt;/p&gt;
