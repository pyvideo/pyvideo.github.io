manage and deploy it into production. Beyond reproducibility, factors
such as flexibility, readability, and production readiness play crucial
roles in enhancing project efficiency. This is where Kedro comes in, a
framework specifically designed to take your ML projects to another
level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will introduce Kedro and explain the contexts in which
it should be used. You'll gain hands-on experience with Python, learning
how to smoothly integrate Kedro into your projects. This will enable you
to spend less time on tedious 'plumbing' work and more time focusing on
solving new problems.&lt;/p&gt;
