Allegro uses PyTorch for efficient equivariant potentials with state-of-the-art accuracy, while FLARE is a sparse Gaussian process potential with an optimized C++ training backend leveraging Kokkos, OpenMP, and MPI for state-of-the-art performance, and a user-friendly Python frontend. We will compare and contrast the two methods, discuss lessons learned, and show spectacular scientific applications.&lt;/p&gt;
