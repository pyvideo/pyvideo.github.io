The once expressive experience of a single author writing dynamically typed Python can turn into a real headache as the complexity of your system develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Python can still be a great choice for large applications - the library’s for scientific applications and web API’s are well documented, open-source and have been in development for decades. Mypy is a tool that (pretty much) allows you to have your cake and eat it. By combining the convenience and maturity of Python with a powerful type system and compile-time checking, you can make your project incredibly easy to read, debug and test for all contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk will summarise the main features of Mypy and will also give you a head start on how to convert (and maintain) an existing code-base to include static annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
