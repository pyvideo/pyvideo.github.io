unknown, or its script forgotten (or both), or because it was
deliberately enciphered. Deciphering needs two steps: Identify the
language, then map the unknown script to a familiar one. Iâ€™ll present an
algorithm to solve a cartoon version of this problem, where the language
is known, and the cipher is alphabet rearrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
