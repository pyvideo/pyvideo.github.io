theory of General Relativity, the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detected the first gravitational
wave signal from the collision of two black holes, a discovery honored
by the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Now, three years later, observations
of these binary black hole mergers are becoming routine, and the first
neutron star merger signal recorded by LIGO and partner European
facility Virgo in August 2017 was accompanied by a blast of gamma-ray,
X-ray, optical, infrared, and radio light, that is now a Rosetta stone
for understanding the origin of heavy elements in the cosmos. I will
talk about the role of Python in these discoveries: from operating the
detectors, to analyzing the data, pushing alerts to astronomers, and
connecting scientists and educators with LIGO open data.Presenter(s):
Speaker: Leo Singer, LIGO&lt;/p&gt;
