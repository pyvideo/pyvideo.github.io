facts about American and British spies' deep appetite for information,
economic spying and the methods they use to collect data. They
systematically tapped international communications on a scale that only
few people could imagine. But what are the consequences for societies
when they now know about the NSA metadata repository capable of taking
in billions of &amp;quot;events&amp;quot; daily to collected and analyze? Is there a way
to defend against an agency with a monstrous secret budget?&lt;/p&gt;
