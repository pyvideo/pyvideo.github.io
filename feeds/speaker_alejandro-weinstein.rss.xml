mathematical tools to Python, the NumPy/SciPy libraries provide an
ecosystem where multiple libraries can coexist and interact. This talk
describes a success story where we integrate several libraries,
developed by different groups, to solve our research problems. A brief
description of our research and how we use these components follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research focuses on using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to gather
information in domains described by an underlying linked dataset. For
instance, we are interested in problems such as the following: given a
Wikipedia article as a seed, finding other articles that are interesting
relative to the starting point. Of particular interest is to find
articles that are more than one-click away from the seed, since these
articles are in general harder to find by a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the staples of scientific Python computing NumPy, SciPy,
Matplotlib, and IPython, we use the libraries RL-Glue/RL-Library,
NetworkX, Gensim, and scikit-learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement Learning considers the interaction between a given
environment and an agent. The objective is to design an agent able to
learn a policy that allows it to maximize its total expected reward. We
use the RL-Glue/RL-Library libraries for our RL experiments. This
libraries provide the infrastructure to connect an environment and an
agent, each one described by an independent Python program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We represent the linked datasets we work with as graphs. For this we use
NetworkX, which provides data structures to efficiently represent graphs
together with implementations of many classic graph algorithms. We use
NetworkX graphs to describe the environments implemented in RL-Glue/RL-
Library. We also use these graphs to create, analyze and visualize
graphs built from unstructured data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the contributions of our research is the idea of representing the
items in the datasets as vectors belonging to a linear space. To this
end, we build a Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) model to project
documents onto a vector space. This allows us, in addition to being able
to compute similarities between documents, to leverage a variety of RL
techniques that require a vector representation. We use the Gensim
library to build the LSA model. This library provides all the machinery
to build, among other options, the LSA model. One place where Gensim
shines is in its capability to handle big data sets, like the entire
Wikipedia, that do not fit in memory. We also combine the vector
representation of the items as property of the NetworkX nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also use the manifold learning capabilities of sckit-learn,
like the ISOMAP algorithm, to perform some exploratory data analysis. By
reducing the dimensionality of the LSA vectors obtained using Gensim
from 400 to 3, we are able to visualize the relative position of the
vectors together with their connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this talk shows, by combining a variety of libraries to
solve our research problems, that the NumPy/SciPy ecosystem has become
the lingua-franca of scientific Python computing.&lt;/p&gt;
