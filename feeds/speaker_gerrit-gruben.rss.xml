but you also need to report on your results as well as win the hearts
and minds of the decision makers â€“ the life of a data scientist ain't
easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do you make them &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt;? Surely, you cannot teach them
matrix calculus and functional analysis in an afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take my hand and I walk you through the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

Did you know that the web interface works like a modal editor such as VIM? Do you know that you can actually profile AND debug code in notebooks? How about setting formulas or use pre-made style settings for visualizations? Let us go through the tricks of the trade together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overview of the Jupyter project + setup to get everyone on board.
Handling the UI, know the shortcuts
Different type of cells
Exporting notebooks for presentations
Handling different kernels
Set styles for visualizations for professional quality
Mod the style of the web interface yourself via CSS
Profiling code in notebooks, use Cython
Debugging in notebooks&lt;/p&gt;
