makes managing common aspects of Python projects easier, by providing
just the right kind of scaffolding on which to automate building and
packaging of your software. In this talk, you'll see how easy it is to
get started with Paver, how you can use Paver without alienating other
users of your code, and how you can use Paver to trivially extend
Python's distutils commands.&lt;/p&gt;
