&lt;p&gt;John will present a simple character-level Markov model for simulating language in Python. The goal is to generate text that demonstrates how English looks to non-English readers. The model generates text that is simultaneously totally foreign and yet weirdly familiar, using logic simple enough that anyone could replicate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;engl_ish is a Python model for text generation. It is based on a character level Markov model augmented with some additional logic, with the aim of capturing the &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; of a language. The goal is to generate text in e.g. English, such that it contains no actual English meaning, but nonetheless looks like English to someone who doesn't speak the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, John will share his inspiration for creating the model, go into detail about its logic and how it was implemented in Python, share results from a variety of training sets and settings, and talk about issues and opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
