We must make wrong predictions
to learn, and we must try the impossible to break out of our
complacency. This talk will explore the key role mistakes play in our
own minds, our attempts to build AIs, and our practice as programmers.
We are going to argue that mistakes are your best friend and offer some
guidance on how to make more of them.&lt;/p&gt;
