“thing”? Whether you ask developers, marketing folks or users, you often
get very different views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with user interfaces, documentation helps all stakeholders align
their mental model of a product. Terminology plays a key role, and a
controlled vocabulary is an ace up the technical writer's sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled vocabularies are basically lists of concepts and the
relationships between them. Beyond consistent naming, they are about
structuring, categorizing and retrieving content. For example, you can
use a vocabulary as a basis for documentation plans, tables of content,
a help site's navigation, search filters, or even to organize test
cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will share ways to create and maintain various types of
vocabularies, and explain what each type is useful for. You can start
with a flat list of terms and expand it into a glossary, a thesaurus, a
taxonomy, or even a full-fledge ontology.&lt;/p&gt;
