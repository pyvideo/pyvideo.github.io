I joined them at the time that their entire company backend was run on a huge PHP based Monolith application which cannot scale out and required the largest Amazon EC2 instance at that time in order to handle all the workloads. By the time I left them, we have successfully migrated the system into Microservices architecture. This talk will walk you through multiple points of time during that period. Explaining how we gradually pull functionalities out of the legacy system. What kind of challenges have we faced along the way. What have we learned so far.
