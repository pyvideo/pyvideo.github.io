There are a lot of ways to handle this, but all of them require time and you might not be able to go back to a particular point to resume or restart training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you will learn how you can use the open-source tool, DVC, to compare training metrics using two methods for tuning hyperparameters: grid search and random search. You’ll learn how you can save and track the changes in your data, code, and metrics without adding a lot of commits to your Git history. This approach will scale with your data and projects and make sure that your team can reproduce results easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
