still haven't made the switch to Python 3. This talk is for anyone
facing a 2-to-3 migration that they'd like to feel more confident about.
Attendees will leave with the outline of a migration plan, some
suggested focus areas, a knowledge of helpful tools, and links to
resources they can use after the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

languages like C, Fortran and C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk gives an overview of your many options for getting Python to
call and exchange data with code written in a compiled language. The
goal is to make attendees aware of choices they may not know they
have, and when to prefer one over another.&lt;/p&gt;

But instead of using a library, why not let Libre/OpenOffice do most of the heavy lifting?&lt;/p&gt;
