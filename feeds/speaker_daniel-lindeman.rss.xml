The cost
savings? The developer story? Because it's shiny and new? In this talk I
will start with a basic Flask App and show the process of migrating to a
serverless architecture on AWS using the Serverless framework. Along the
way, we'll also highlight some of the tradeoffs developers make when
choosing a serverless architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

In order to
keep track of my personal library, a daunting task indeed, I’ve employed
Python, a Raspberry Pi, and an RFID reader. Take a tour through what
it’s like working with hardware, Python, and putting it all together
into a useful web application. This is a beginner friendly talk, so
don’t worry if you’ve never worked with hardware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Things (IoT) is here to stay, but getting started can
seem intimidating. Inspired by the magical checkout process at my local
library, I began the journey of building my own IoT book lending
application. Along the way, I discovered that Python was consistently
able to make the impossible seem approachable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll start with a base installation of Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi and
find that Python is already there waiting to help. Then we’ll hook up an
RFID reader to our Pi, and see that even though it has wires and pins,
it’s nothing to be scared of. With the RFID reader and the fantastic
MFRC522-python library, we’re able to read and write data to RFID
stickers, neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could stop here, but we’ve got Python, so let’s hook it up to a Flask
app and end at a complete book lending application. I hope attendees
will gain an appreciation for the technology all around them, their
local library, and how powerful Python is. I hope to demystify working
with hardware and dispel some perceived barriers to entry for IoT
applications.&lt;/p&gt;

I love them in Python, I love them in
Kotlin. A while back I was looking for a Kotlin dataclass feature in
Python, and was disappointed to find it wasn't there. I went digging
into the CPython source code to see if it could be added and found the
craziest function I'd ever seen, _create_fn, and it's used everywhere
in the dataclass implementation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me as I shared what I found out about my dear dataclasses, and get
a better understand of decorators and metaprogramming in Python!&lt;/p&gt;
