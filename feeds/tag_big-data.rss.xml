stack to keep things running, fortunately a large chunk of the stack is
Open Source and fair chunk of it is Python to boot. By the end of the
talk attendees will understand the scale of the infrastructure (both
physical and software) that is required, and have an idea of what sort
of problems a synchrotron could help them solve.&lt;/p&gt;

Python. I will introduce Luigi and show how it solves problems while
running multiple chain of batch jobs like dependency resolution,
workflow management, visualisation, failure handling etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I will present how to package Luigi pipelines as Docker
image for easier testing and deployment. Finally, I will go through way
to deploy them on Kubernetes cluster, thus making it possible to scale
Big Data pipelines on- demand and reduce infrastructure costs. I will
also give tips and tricks to make Luigi Scheduler play well with
Kubernetes batch execution feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be accompanied by demo project. It will be very
beneficial for audience who have some experience in running batch jobs
(not necessarily in Python), typically people who work in Big Data
sphere like data scientists, data engineers, BI devs and software
developers. Familiarity with Python is helpful but not needed.&lt;/p&gt;

not, our business is in-house farming at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We design and build our farms, grow vegetables and sell them, and the
backbone of our infrastructure is based on Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check this video to see what we do -&amp;gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/christianbarra/status/1096399602159439874"&gt;https://twitter.com/christianbarra/status/1096399602159439874&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 10 million observations are recorded from our farms, feeding
our farm management system that allows operators, plant scientists, and
supervisors to monitor each farm in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk I will briefly introduce the world's problems we are
trying to resolve at Infarm and then talk about our IoT farms,
infrastructure, how we use Python and how we plan to improve the
capabilities of our farms by adding edge machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agenda&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- What are the problems we are trying to solve at Infarm&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Our 4 tech pillars&lt;/div&gt;

scientists is cleaning the data to analyze it. Textbook statistical
modeling is sufficient for noisy signals, but errors of a discrete
nature break standard tools of machine learning. I will discuss how to
easily run machine learning on data tables with two common dirty-data
problems: missing values and non-normalized entries. On both problems, I
will show how to run standard machine-learning tools such as
scikit-learn in the presence of such errors. The talk will be didactic
and will discuss simple software solutions. It will build on the latest
improvements to scikit-learn for missing values and the DirtyCat package
[2] for non normalized entries. I will also summarize theoretical
analyses in recent machine learning publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk targets data practitioners. Its goal are to help data
scientists to be more efficient analysing data with such errors and
understanding their impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With missing values, I will use simple arguments and examples to outline
how to obtain asymptotically good predictions [3]. Two components are
key: imputation and adding an indicator of missingness. I will explain
theoretical guidelines for these, and I will show how to implement these
ideas in practice, with scikit-learn as a learner, or as a preprocesser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-normalized categories, I will show that using their string
representations to “vectorize” them, creating vectorial representations
gives a simple but powerful solution that can be plugged in standard
statistical analysis tools [4].&lt;/p&gt;

calculations. They could be scientists, developers working in close
contact with scientists, or even people working on finance and other
quantitative fields. Such people are routinely confronted with issues
like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1 parallelism: how to parallelize calculations efficiently&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2 data: how to store and manage large amounts of data efficiently&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;3 memory: how to avoid running out of memory&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;4 performance: how to be fast&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the talk is to teach some lessons learned after several
years of doing numeric simulations in a context were micro-optimizations
are the least important factor, while overall architecture, design
choices and good algorithms are of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;

objects with a reference to the planet's surface. This data usually
consists of a spatial component, of various attributes, and sometimes of
a time reference (where, what, and when). Efficient processing and
visualization of small to large-scale spatial data is a challenging
task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk describes how to process and visualize geospatial vector and
raster data using Python and the Jupyter Notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To process the data a high performance computer with 4 GPUS (NVidia
Tesla V100), 192 GB RAM, 44 CPU Cores is used to run JupyterHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous modules available which help using geospatial data in
using low- and high-level interfaces, which are shown in this
presentation. In addition, it is shown how to use deep learning for
raster analysis using the high performance GPUs and several deep
learning frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

When was the last time you
smiled at something you made? Playing with fun datasets, especially big
data sets, opens up weird new forms of technical recreation. Why not
train an amusing model in a browser tab while you're waiting for that
day-job Spark query to finish? I'll show you some data toys I've built
using AI and interesting data sets: Most of them involve both backend
data science and front-end visualization tricks. They range from
poetry-composition helpers to game log analysis to image deconstruction
and reconstruction. All of them taught me something, often about myself
and what I like artistically, and sometimes about what &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot;
actually means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As software engineers work on CI/CD process as soon as they start a new project, data scientists and ML engineers define a pipeline for data as it flows through a typical workflow. Each step of the pipeline is fed data processed from its preceding step as CI/CD process starts from code changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pipelining ML project&amp;quot; is sometimes misleading as it implies a large project with a group of engineers working on some large systems , being considered to be hard for an individual and unnecessary for a small project. Regardless of its size, having well organized pipelines for any ML projects is essential to succeed and actually it could be done easily with utilizing a proper tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will go through a machine learning workflow divided into a few steps composing a ML pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment. Each step depends on data produced by previous step, which are controlled by DVC. DVC is open-source version control system for data scientist and ML engineer helping them to organize data, models and experiments for some ML projects. The presentation will not only introduce how to use the tool but also show how to organize a ML pipeline with some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to motivate data scientists and ML engineer to start building machine learning pipeline with DVC. Audience might expect a guide to using DVC  for automating the pipeline. Also I will give some explanation about concepts of machine learning related techniques necessary for understanding the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session is designed to be accessible to everyone in beginners level. Understandings of basic concepts of machine learning and version control system (preferably, Git) might be helpful but not mandatory for the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

Packaging is particularly hard when code needs to run in a distributed computing environment where it is difficult to know what runs where and which parts of the code are available to run there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will present different ways to ship Python code to a compute cluster, what Python's &amp;quot;pickling&amp;quot; feature has to do with this, what self contained executables are and the challenges we met when shipping Python code to a cluster with 1000s of nodes running 1000s of jobs like TensorFlow or Spark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, we will show how one can run a PySpark job on top of S3 storage using PEX as a self contained executable artifact. Finally we will explain how those ideas generalize for different Jobs (like Tensorflow, Dask), different virtual environments (like Anaconda or vanilla Python virtual envs) and different distributed storage's (like S3 or HDFS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auditor will get an overview of the challenges of Python packaging for distributed applications and see code samples that can be applied in his own project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MongoDB is webscale, right? It's a JSON database, it's eventually consistent, and you use map-reduce to query it. Oh, and it's insecure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me clear up some things: MongoDB is an ACID-compliant database with transactions, schemas &amp;amp; relationships. It includes a powerful aggregation query language; map-reduce has been deprecated for some time now. MongoDB doesn't speak or store JSON, and nowadays it comes with pretty good security defaults (we think).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many myths around about MongoDB - what it is, how it works, and what it does wrong. Like any database product, you need to know its capabilities and how to get the best out of it. On top of this, the product has changed a lot over the years, but lots of information out there hasn't caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll cover 8 myths around MongoDB, explain how they're wrong, why the myth originated in the first place (some of them weren't originally myths).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What exactly is MongoDB?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the current release of MongoDB?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB is not a JSON database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB has transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB allows relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should only consider sharding if you must.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB is secure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB stores your data reliably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB is a big product, with lots to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I'll explain some of MongoDB's best-kept secrets, and provide practical tips and tricks for using it. The audience will leave with a good idea of what MongoDB is, what it isn't, and how to best develop with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larger datasets can't fit into RAM - suddenly you can't use Pandas any more - but we need to analyse that data! First we'll review techniques to compress our data (maybe cutting our DataFrame RAM usage in half!) so we can process more rows using regular Pandas. Next we'll look at clever ways to make common operations run faster on DataFrames including dropping down to numpy, compiling with Numba and running multi-core. Finally for still-larger datasets we'll review Dask on Pandas and the new Vaex competitor solution. You'll leave with new techniques to make your DataFrames smaller and ideas for processing your data faster.
This talk is inspired by Ian's work updating his O'Reilly book High Performance Python to the 2nd edition for 2020. With over 10 years of evolution the Pandas DataFrame library has gained a huge amount of functionality and it is used by millions of Pythonistas - but the most obvious way to solve a task isn't always the fastest or most RAM efficient. This talk will help any Pandas user (beginner or beyond) process more data faster, making them more effective at their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

It might solve non-complex or well-defined standard problems. This presentation is a demystification of years of experience and painful mistakes using Python as a core to create reliable data pipelines and manage insanely amount of valuable data. Let's cover how each piece fits into this puzzle: data acquisition, ingestion, transformation, storage, workflow management and serving. Also, we'll walk through best practices and possible issues. We'll cover PySpark vs Dask and Pandas, Airflow, and Apache Arrow as a new approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at higher redshifts is equivalent to looking back in time: they improve the studies of cosmology, expanding our knowledge of the universe. It allows us to study various physical phenomena like the power spectrum of galaxies which describes the distribution of galaxies on a range of scales, galaxy clustering, and large scales, the detection of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation feature.
As a result,  a significant amount of work has been done to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the process via new algorithms and optimization of existing ones.
Astronomical datasets are undergoing a rapid growth in size and complexity as past, ongoing and future surveys produce massive multi-temporal and multi-wavelength datasets, with huge information to be extracted and analyzed.
The alternative to a full spectroscopic survey is to obtain multi-color images of the sky and perform photometric redshift estimates for the galaxies we have available.
When dealing with this problem, there are two main approaches: model-driven data analysis (template fitting methods) and data-driven analysis, which can use machine learning methods.
To solve this problem, we use data-driven analysis, more specifically GPz (which uses Gaussian processes)  and  ANNz2 (which mainly uses neural networks), both python software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prerequisites: machine learning and basic math knowledge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide a practical insight on how to build scalable data streaming machine learning pipelines to process large datasets in real time using Python and popular frameworks such as Kafka, SpaCy and Seldon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be covering a case study performing automated content moderation on Reddit comments in real time. Our dataset will consist of 200k reddit comments from /r/science, 50,000 of which have been removed by moderators. We will be handling the stream data in a Kubernetes cluster, and the stream processing will be handled using the stream processing library Kafka. We will be running the end-to-end pipeline in Kubernetes with various components legeraging SKLearn, SpaCy and Seldon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will then dive into fundamental concepts on stream processing such as windows, watermarking and checkponting, and we will show how to use each of these frameworks to build complex data streaming pipelines that can perform real time processing at scale by building, deploying and monitoring a machine learning model which will process production incoming data..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we will show best practices when using these frameworks, as well as a high level overview of tools that can be used for monitoring in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;

Its superior productivity makes it the preferred tool for prototyping. However, traditional Python packages are not necessarily designed to provide high performance and scalability for large datasets.
We start our tutorial with a short introduction on how to get close-to-native performance with Intel-optimized packages, such as numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn. The next part of the tutorial is focused on getting high performance and scalability from multi-cores on a single machine to large clusters of workstations. We will demonstrate that with Python it is possible to achieve the same performance and scalability as with hand-tuned C++/MPI code:
-       Scalable Dataframe Compiler (SDC) is used to compile analytics code using pandas/Python and scale it to bare-metal cluster performance. It compiles a subset of Python code into efficient parallel binaries that use message passing to perform collective communications.
-       A convenient Python API to data analytics and machine learning primitives (daal4py). While its interface is scikit-learn-like, its MPI-based engine allows to scale machine learning algorithms to bare-metal cluster performance.
-       In the tutorial, we will use SDC and daal4py together to build an end-to-end analytics pipeline that scales to clusters, requiring only minimal code changes.&lt;/p&gt;

and engineering work. This choice, together with Python as an underlying
programming language gives us flexibility, a feature-rich interface, and
access to a large community and ecosystem. When it comes to preserving
the data and exchanging it with different software stacks, we rely on
Parquet Datasets / Hive Tables. During the write process, there is a
shift from a rather weakly typed world to a strongly typed one. For
example, Pandas may convert integers to floats for many operations
without asking, but parquet files and the schema information stored
alongside them dictate very precise types. The type situation may get
even more &amp;quot;colorful&amp;quot;, when datasets are written by multiple code
versions or different software solutions over time. This then results in
important questions regarding type compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will first represent an overview on types at different layers
(like NumPy, Pandas, Arrow and Parquet) and the transition between this
layers. The second part of the talk will present examples of type
compatibility we have seen and why+how we think they should be handled.
At the end there will be a Q+A, which can be seen as the start of a
potentially longer RFC process to align different software stacks (like
Hive and Dask) to handle types in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;

Spark, SQL, and Data Lakes often creates more fog than clarity. However,
clarity about the underlying technologies is crucial to designing the
best technical solution in any field relying on huge amounts of data
including data science, machine learning, but also more traditional
analytical systems such as data integration, data warehousing,
reporting, and OLAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my presentation, I will show that often at least three dimensions are
cluttered and confused in discussions when it comes to data management:
First, buzzwords (labels &amp;amp; terms like &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;AI&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;data lake&amp;quot;);
second, data design patterns (principles &amp;amp; best practices like:
selection push-down, materialization, indexing); and Third, software
platforms (concrete implementations &amp;amp; frameworks like: Python, DBMS,
Spark, and NoSQL-systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only by keeping these three dimensions apart, it is possible to create
technically-sound architectures in the field of big data analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show concrete examples, which through a simple redesign and wise
choice of the right tools and technologies, run thereby up to 1000 times
faster. This in turn triggers tremendous savings in terms of development
time, hardware costs, and maintenance effort.&lt;/p&gt;

models to well-groomed datasets. Everyone working on industrial problems
will eventually learn, that this does not reflect reality. The amount of
time spent on modeling is small compared to data gathering, -warehousing
and -cleaning. Even after training and deployment of the model, the work
is not done. Continuous monitoring of the performance and input data is
still necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I discuss how important data handling is for successful
data science projects. Each milestone, from finding the business case to
continuously monitoring the performance of the solution, is addressed.
This is exemplary shown on a project, with the goal of improving a
productive system.&lt;/p&gt;

redefine the performance and interoperability of most Big Data
technologies in early 2016. Since then implementations in Java, C++,
Python, Glib, Ruby, Go, JavaScript and Rust have been added. Although
Apache Arrow (&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pyarrow&lt;/tt&gt;) is already known to many Python/Pandas users
for reading Apache Parquet files, its main benefit is the cross-language
interoperability. With feather and PySpark, you can already benefit from
this in Python and R/Java via the filesystem or network. While they
improve data sharing and remove serialization overhead, data still needs
to be copied as it is passed between processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 0.23 release of Pandas, the concept of ExtensionArrays was
introduced. They allow the extension of Pandas DataFrames and Series
with custom, user- defined typed. The most prominent example is
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cyberpandas&lt;/tt&gt; which adds an IP dtype that is backed by the appropriate
representation using NumPy arrays. These ExtensionArrays are not limited
to arrays backed by NumPy but can take an arbitrary storage as long as
they fulfill a certain interfaces. Using Apache Arrow we can implement
ExtensionArrays that are of the same dtype as the built-in types of
Pandas but memory management is not tied to Pandas' internal
BlockManager. On the other hand Apache Arrow has a much more wider set
of efficient types that we can also expose as an ExtensionArray. These
types include a native string type as well as a arbitrarily nested types
such as &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;list of …&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;struct of (…, …, …)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show the real-world benefits of this, we take the example of a data
pipeline that pulls data from a relational store, transforms it and then
passes it into a machine learning model. A typical setup nowadays most
likely involves a data lake that is queried with a JVM based query
engine. The machine learning model is then normally implemented in
Python using popular frameworks like CatBoost or Tensorflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sometimes these query engines provide Python clients, their
performance is normally not optimized for large results sets. In the
case of a machine learning model, we will do some feature
transformations and possibly aggregations with the query engine but feed
as many rows as possible into the model. This will lead then to result
sets that have above a million rows. In contrast to the Python clients,
these engines often come with efficient JDBC drivers that can cope with
result sets of this size but then the conversion from Java objects to
Python objects in the JVM bridge will slow things down again. In our
example, we will show how to use Arrow to retrieve a large result in the
JVM and then pass it on to Python without running into these
bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;

to a large amount of open- source packages (numpy, matplotlib, pandas,
..). SAP HANA provides highly optimized in-database machine learning

an environment he/she is most familiar with and access the data stored
in SAP HANA using SAP HANA machine learning libraries with a
scikit-learn type interface. Data will remain in the database and will
be exposed as dataframes (similar to Pandas dataframes). We will explain

REST API with a NoSQL database as backend. No need for database
migrations or upfront schema design. The basic CRUD (create, read,
update, delete) operations are available for getting data in and out
from the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stretchy is free and open source software built with Python 3, using
Flask web framework. It currently uses MongoDB as its backend database.
Since it is interfaced through the REST API however, Stretchy is
technology agnostic and developers can create bindings to other
databases, including SQL databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation reviews the reasons for creating Stretchy, its current
applications, an short tutorial on how to use it, and tips on how to
deploy it.&lt;/p&gt;

bother with because the gory details of it are hidden deep within the
interpreter itself. The garbage collector takes out the trash and we can
spend our precious time bothering with more important things on our
minds. Living in this encapsulated utopia is nice but sometimes it is
worth it to peak behind the curtains to unleash the full power of your
application. In this talk I want to show you when it is necessary to
face this harsh world and convince you that it is in fact not as scary
as it may seem. Using real life examples, I’m going to show you how to
use the garbage collector and open source tooling to get control over
the memory you might not even know you had at your disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

way to talk to native code and libraries, it is also a widely used tool
for speeding up Python code. The Cython compiler translates Python code
to C or C++ code, and applies many static optimisations that make Python
code run visibly faster than in the interpreter. But even better, it
supports static type annotations that allow direct use of C/C++ data
types and functions, which the compiler uses to convert and optimise the
code into fast, native C. The tight integration of all three languages,
Python, C and C++, makes it possible to freely mix Python features like
generators and comprehensions with C/C++ features like native data
types, pointer arithmetic or manually tuned memory management in the
same code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk by a core developer introduces the Cython compiler by
interactive code examples, and shows how you can use it to speed up your
real-world Python code. You will learn how you can profile a Python
module and use Cython to compile and optimise it into a fast binary
extension module. All of that, without losing the ability to run it
through common development tools like code checkers or coverage test
tools.&lt;/p&gt;

large &amp;amp; complex model (pipelines), doing these can take up a lot of
time. The traditional way usually includes one beefy machine and a lot
of waiting. In other cases, people tend to “manually” schedule parameter
ranges between nodes, but that can also be problematic since these won't
talk to each other. Kubernetes itself is currently the most prominent
scheduler and shines at distributing task, but is a pretty complex
system in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will show how you can harness the scheduling of
kubernetes for distributing hyperparameter search with sklearn onto a
cluster of nodes. This can be achieved quite easily and with just a few
changes to the original code, so the Data Scientist won't be bothered by
complex kubernetes internals.&lt;/p&gt;

Tools to combine the strengths will enable easier collaboration in
projects and more possibilities to succeed. Using Python from R gives R
users wider access to functions and makes it easier for Python beginners
to just run scripts and being able to collaborate in Python projects.
The talk will show the possibilities of reticulate: The main part starts
with demonstrating the Python interpreter within R. It will show how to
source Python scripts as well as install and import modules. Then it
will deal with the most important types of Python objects, how they are
represented in R and how to further manipulate them. Thereby, a special
focus is on using Python for data science. In addition, it will be
presented how Conda environments can be created and used from R. A
further application will be the creation of reports with Markdown and
LaTeX where R and Python can be used within one document and share
objects. A last topic is about showing the possibilities for easier
development in RStudio (help regarding Python functions, auto
completion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selinon enhances Celery task flow management and allows you to create
and model task flows in your distributed environment that can
dynamically change behavior based on computed results in your cluster,
automatically resolve tasks that need to be executed in case of
selective task runs, automatic tracing mechanism and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you do when you need to move your model from your laptop to
production?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;big data == I need to use JVM&lt;/tt&gt; the right assumption?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I put my jupyter notebook in production?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you apply the best software engineering practices (testing and
ci for example) inside your data science process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you “decouple” your data scientists, developers and devops
teams?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you guarantee the reproducibility of your models?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you scale your training process when does not fit in memory
anymore?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you serve your models and provide an easy rollback system?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agenda:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Data Science workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scaling is not just a matter of the size of your Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scaling when the size of your Data matters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DDS, Dockerized Data Science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cassiny&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll share my experience highlighting some of the challenges I faced and
the solutions I came up to answer these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this presentation I will mention libraries like jupyter, atom,
scikit- learn, dask, ray, parquet, arrow and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principles and best practices I will share are something that you
can apply, more or less easily, if you are running or in the process to
run a production system based on the Python stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on (my) best practices to run the Python Data stack
together and I will also talk about Cassiny, an open source project I
started, that aims to simplify your life if you want to use a completely
Python based solution in your data science workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

inventory, how much, and when. Aim of the forecast is to increase parts
availability with the less possible impact on inventory, having enough
stock in the warehouse to ensure the business keeps moving but not
enough stock to drain its limited cash reserves. This decision process
is being profoundly revised in its foundational concepts, thanks to new
classification methodologies enabled by Machine Learning. We integrated
domain knowledge and ML to create a new classification and level setting
process, leveraging on 6 years of data and new statistical indicators
for demand patter. These new features are used to run the machine
learning algorithm that classify Make To Stock / Make To Order items in
a single flow approach. The validation phase is reduced at each
iteration as ML model can be re-trained to incorporate past validations,
increasing efficiency and performances. Level setting problem is
addressed benchmarking ML methods (Reinforcement Learning), Montecarlo
simulations and traditional statistical methodologies. Regarding RL and
Montecarlo we established punishments for letting an particular
inventory item run out of stock and we also punish the model for stock
too higher value for too long. For rewards, we primarily focus on
ordering items within a safe window before the demand. First application
of this new methodology brings a 20% reduction of inventory, without
impact on sales, and a workload reduction of about 70%.&lt;/p&gt;

Jupyter, Matplotlib and xarray, Python is becoming the language of
choice in many scientific communities from Physics to Climate Science,
from Earth Observation to Economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A turn-key but less-know component of the scientific ecosystem is the
dask library that enable seamless parallel, distributed and GPU
computing in most cases without code changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use climate science as an typical example of a discipline where
simple tasks become easily big data problems and where mastering xarray,
dask and dask.distributed is the key to turn them back into simple
tasks, possibly on a large cluster of VMs (that you can easily provision
from your preferred cloud provider).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Airflow is a popular orchestration tool that uses Python to
author workflows, but what is it, what are the architectural components,
why do I need this, and how do you get started? If you care about
reliably getting your data from source to your big data platforms, this
is the talk for you. Moving, refining and enriching data in order to get
actionable insights is hard. Apache Airflow, an open source project that
makes it easy for data engineers to create repeatable and reliable
workflows in Python. This session will be a hands on getting started
looking at creating your first workflows and understanding how you can
use the features of Apache Airflow to orchestrate your own data
pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Engineering is the backbone of all analytics that happens in any
organization. This marks data engineering as the central role in any
data-driven organization. This talk aims to introduce the fundamentals
of data engineering with python apps driving the core concepts. The aim
of this talk is to introduce the audience to the world of big data
analytics with pythonic tools and libraries at its core. One can expect
the talk to cover the basics of Extract, Transform and Load(ETL)
pipelines using python scripts and then Airflow with PySpark. These ETL
pipelines are core to any data infrastructure. There will be a discourse
on how we can use cloud providers and design an entire system that is
responsible for analytics and ML in an organization. Finally a short
outro into how one can start their journey to become a data engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s build an event driven application together! Using Flask as
framework we’ll add the powerful Apache Kafka, a streaming platform, as
backend… all live on stage! Join to understand how to integrate your
application with Apache Kafka! Solid event driven applications are based
on a widely adopted coding framework and a resilient data streaming
technology. While Flask is a common choice for the framework, a wise
selection of the backend data systems can bring benefits in terms of
ease of integration and performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session we will explore Apache Kafka, a data streaming platform,
that enables reliable real-time data integration for your event driven
application. We will look at the types of problems that Kafka is best at
solving, and show how to use it in your own applications. We’ll then
take a look at Kafka in action, by creating a Flask web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After understanding how to produce and consume events from Apache Kafka,
we’ll then introduce Kafka Connect, a selection of pre-built connectors
making Apache Kafka your only backend interface, no matter where your
data originally sits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re using Flask, and want to understand how to make your
application event driven by integrating it with the most used streaming
technology, this session is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

detection in documenti testuali - PyCon Italia 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De-costruire un file PDF è un task di sempre maggior interesse; questo
talk mostrerà come sfruttare l’informazione non strutturata dei dati per
la generazione di PDF sintetici da utilizzare in sistemi di
apprendimento più controllabili, con l’uso di Transformers ed NLP su
dataset ristretti di PDF. Il Portable Document Format (meglio noto come
PDF) è il formato di file più utilizzato al mondo. All’interno di un
file PDF possiamo trovare un’ampia gamma di elementi diversi, non solo
semplice testo: elementi grafici come immagini ed algoritmi, tabelle,
didascalie, addirittura oggetti interattivi o firme digitali. La
decostruzione di un file PDF è dunque un task difficile, per l’alto
livello di eterogeneità dei dati e perché il formato stesso non è stato
pensato per fornire in modo strutturato la disposizione delle diverse
entità che costituiscono le pagine dei documenti. Tuttavia, questo tipo
di analisi sta attirando sempre più l’interesse di ricercatori e
aziende, perché le informazioni sul layout e i contenuti dei file di
testo possono essere utilizzate per aumentare i dataset esistenti per
ottenere miglioramenti qualitativi nell’espletamento delle comuni
operazioni di data mining, sfruttando le tecniche di deep learning più
innovative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questo talk, descrive un sistema che, partendo da un insieme ristretto
di file PDF, è in grado di generarne un numero arbitrariamente grande
per costituire un dataset di immagini da utilizzare per addestrare reti
neurali a svolgere le classiche operazioni di object detection e
recognition; per fare questo, sarà mostrata una pipeline capace di
annotare automaticamente il contenuto di un PDF; dopodiché, sarà
spiegato come utilizzare le annotazioni precedentemente ottenute come
input di una architettura a Transformers per generare layout artificiali
di documenti; infine, si passerà all’effettiva sintesi dei PDF: verrà
indicato come popolare le parti testuali dei layout generati grazie a
tecniche di NLP (Natural Language Processing), come popolare immagini,
tabelle e formule e, infine, come utilizzare il dataset sintetico così
ottenuto.&lt;/p&gt;

master? Knowledge of deep learning tools? Hadoop? SciPy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk reveals the cornerstone of data science: nothing is as
important as asking data the right questions. To make it work, we need
some tools and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While focusing on tools, we will first go over the data science subject
as a whole, define our goals, continue with an overview of the essential
Python packages like Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, and conclude with a
live demo. The purpose of this talk is to understand our data: read it,
