This is mainly due to the efficiency with which consumers can get their
data, the ease with which you can document and explore your API and the
powerful tooling that has been built around the query language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for novices and experts of GraphQL alike and aims to cover
the basics of the query language, how to implement it using Flask and
SQLAlchemy and to take a deeper dive into how Python’s type-hinting can
be used to generate your GraphQL schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll also be talking about some of the tooling that can be used to
provide consumers and developers working on your API with a great
development experience. Next I’ll cover some ways you can use these
tools to empower your development process and get you developing ‘API
First’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of this talk you should have a general understanding
of APIs, Python frameworks and Python ORMs. However, my aim is to make
it as accessible as possible for developers of all experience levels.&lt;/p&gt;
