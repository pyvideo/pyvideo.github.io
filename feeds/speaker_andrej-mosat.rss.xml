included are? Despair no more! We come with battery-powered Python
devices for your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will focus on showcasing and live demonstration of Python running
on very small microprocessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, an overview of existing platforms which can run Python on
batteries. Then we will showcase in a live demo what Python can do
for you. Finally a “how to” workflow for successful Python coding on
low power ARM Cortex microprocessors will be revealed to get you
started.&lt;/p&gt;

processors like ARM, x86. It allows developers to quickly and
effectively write code directly for hardware without the need for
compiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantage of an interpreted language is mainly in removing the
compilation time. Errors appear when executing the program, the response
is immediate. The disadvantages include an increased demand for memory
and unscheduled pause due to the garbage collector. I will introduce
development platforms running interpreted languages, their advantages
and disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main part of the lecture will be devoted to basic hardware
development using examples such as switches, LEDs, potentiometers and
interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
