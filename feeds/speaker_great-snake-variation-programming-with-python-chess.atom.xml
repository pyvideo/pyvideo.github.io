&lt;p&gt;Speaker: William Horton
William Horton recently returned to chess during the pandemic, after a 15 year hiatus. On certain weekends he can be found in the local chess club trying his best, but getting beaten by elementary schoolers. By day he works as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Included Health. He is responsible for building and maintaining the Python infrastructure used by data scientists to create models from medical claims data.&lt;/p&gt;
