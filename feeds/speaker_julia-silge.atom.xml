&lt;p&gt;In this talk, learn about model drift, the different ways the word &amp;quot;performance&amp;quot; is used with models, what you can monitor about a model, how feedback loops impact models, and how you can use vetiver to set yourself up for success with model maintenance. This talk will help practitioners who are already deploying models, but this is also useful knowledge for practitioners earlier in their MLOps journey; decisions made along the way can make the difference between resilient models that are easier to maintain and disappointing or misleading models.&lt;/p&gt;

This new IDE is an extensible tool built to facilitate exploratory data analysis, reproducible authoring, and publishing data artifacts. Positron currently supports these data workflows in either or both Python and R and is designed with a forward-looking architecture that can support other data science languages in the future. In this session, learn from the team-building Positron about how and why it is designed the way it is, what will feel familiar or new coming from other IDEs, and whether it might be a good fit for your own work.&lt;/p&gt;

There are significant barriers to learning about other programming languages outside our comfort zone, and seeing another person or community make a different choice can be baffling. In this talk, hear about the costs that arise from exploring or using multiple programming languages, what we can gain by being open to different languages, and how curiosity and interest in other programming languages supports sharing across communities. We’ll explore these three points with practical examples from software built for flexible storage and model deployment, as well as a brand new project for scientific computing.&lt;/p&gt;
