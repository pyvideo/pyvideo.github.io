In Mobileye, we do it by training neural networks. This method requires an enormous amount of data from many countries, different weather conditions etc. However, in some road scenarios the available data set is still too small, or the data is not accurate. In this session, I will discuss how we developed a system that uses Python with OpenCV to generate augmented images and matching ground truth data in order to improve accuracy of neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
