Proprietary formats produce inaccessible data that require manual extraction. Final results must also be approachable to a diverse audience of engineers, governments, and coastal communities. In 2022, a project was proposed to investigate how a restored beach could respond to waves while mitigating erosion and protecting a cultural resource. Using R and Python wrapped in Quarto, wave model outputs were fully scripted to create a single reproducible document flexible enough to answer multiple modeling questions. As coasts change, rapid modeling and analysis may help preserve coastal access for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
