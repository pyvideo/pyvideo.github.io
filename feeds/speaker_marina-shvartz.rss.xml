In the field of AI this is many times a real struggle. Since eventually most advanced AI models are stochastic - we canâ€™t manually define all their possible edge cases. This led us to use the hypothesis library which does a lot of that for you, while you can focus on defining the properties and specifications of your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will cover shortly the theory of property-based testing and then jump into use cases and examples to demonstrate how we used the hypothesis library to generate random examples of plausible edge cases of our AI model.&lt;/p&gt;
