communicators with nonprofits seeking help with their documentation and
training materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using examples from our work with iNERDE, a social enterprise seeking to
empower West African youth with Science, Technology, Engineering and
Math education, I will describe the many ways in which technical
communicators can make a real difference to the operational
effectiveness of nonprofits and the lives of those they serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you, too, are interested in volunteering your skills for social
impact, this session will hopefully inspire you to action, or, at the
very least encourage you to view the value of your craft in a new light.&lt;/p&gt;
