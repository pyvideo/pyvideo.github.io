&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I started working on SourceForge with a couple of python
developers. Back then the site was written in PHP and was in some ways
buried in technical debt. Everything is different today, we have a
complete set of tools for Ticket tracking, Wiki documents, Git,
Mercurial, Subversion, and IRC - all written in Python, and now released
as open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how the amazing libraries, tools, and talent in the
Python web community has radically changed an established company, and
allowed us to reinvent sourceforge.net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will go over our tech stack, talk about the libraries we used,
the way we solved scalability, internationalization, and performance
issues issues. Ultimately we know that without python, we could not have
built a flexible plugin based system, and gotten permission from
management to open source it.&lt;/p&gt;

developers' strong security knowledge together with analytical,
mathematical and Python development skills to provide IT professionals
with vibrant features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk would be consisted of several parts: short introduction to project
and developers, developing and testing environment, programming cycle,
program's workflow, technologies used, common pitfalls and how we've
circumvent them, usage of mathematical models, optimizations, project's
future goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significant part of this talk would be the immediate insight into
the developing process of probably the world's most advanced open-source
Python IT security project today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London Python Code Dojo is a community organised monthly meeting for
Python programmers in the UK. Variously described as social coding,
developer training, &amp;quot;Scrapheap Challenge&amp;quot; for Pythonistas and &amp;quot;I didn't
learn coding like this when I was a lad&amp;quot;, we've forked the traditional
code-dojo format and turned it into something very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain and explore what happens in the dojo, how it's
organised and why various changes were made to the classic dojo format.
Reference will also be made to influences from music education and
philosophy of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, by the end of the talk you'll all want to go organise a dojo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL is an advanced, versatile open-source database management
system that integrates perfectly with Python. It is developed by a very
active international community and is distributed under the BSD-like
PostgreSQL License.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise-class features (including SQL standard compliance, ACID
transactions, disaster recovery, high availability, replication,
partitioning and general extensibility) make PostgreSQL suitable for
business critical environments seeking to reduce the TCO of their
database solutions without altering their functional needs. PostgreSQL
9.0, released in September 2010, was the first version of PostgreSQL
with Hot Standby, a built-in master/slave replication mechanism.
Asynchronous replication through the standard and consolidated log
shipping technique (previously used with Warm Standby for high
availability) has been enhanced with streaming replication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 9.1, expected to be out later in 2011, will add synchronous
replication to PostgreSQL, making it the first DBMS that allows
developers and users to control the replication strategy at
transactional granularity. Come to the talk and discover all the major
new features of PostgreSQL 9.1, including extensions management,
writable common table expressions (WCTE), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadoop è la principale implementazione open source di MapReduce, il
paradigma di calcolo distribuito su larga scala di Google. L'API nativa
di Hadoop è in Java e le opzioni built-in per la programmazione in
Python - Streaming e Jython - presentano diversi inconvenienti: la prima
consente di accedere solo a un piccolo sottoinsieme delle funzionalità
di Hadoop, mentre la seconda ha tutte le limitazioni di Jython rispetto
a CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydoop.sourceforge.net"&gt;Pydoop&lt;/a&gt; è un'API per Hadoop che rende
disponibile buona parte delle funzionalità di Hadoop al programmatore
Python, consentendo lo sviluppo in CPython. I suoi moduli di base sono
wrapper Boost.Python per l'interfaccia C/C++ di Hadoop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il talk consiste in un tutorial su MapReduce/Hadoop e in una
presentazione dell'API Pydoop, con l'obiettivo principale di avvicinare
le community di Hadoop e Python. Può essere utile, anche se non
strettamente necessaria, una conoscenza di base della programmazione
distribuita.&lt;/p&gt;

community in academia and industry. It is used in a lot of scientific
applications in many different scientific fields and in more and more
industries, for example, in engineering or life science). In all fields,
the use of Python for high- performance and parallel computing is
increasing. Several organizations and companies are providing tools or
support for Python development. This includes libraries for scientific
computing, parallel computing, and MPI. Python is also used on many core
architectures and GPUs, for which specific Python interpreters are being
developed. A related topic is the performance of the various interpreter
and compiler implementations for Python. The talk gives an overview of
Python’s use in HPC and Scientific Computing and gives information on
many topics, such as Python on massively parallel systems, GPU
programming with Python, scientific libraries in Python, and Python
interpreter performance issues. The talk will include examples for
scientific codes and applications from many domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll look at a few pitfalls you may encounter when working with
datetimes in Python. We'll dissect the pytz library, explain why it
contains over 500 individual time zones while focusing on the 63 entries
in Europe. We'll also find the reason why pytz is not part of the
standard Python, why it gets updated so often and why even that won't
solve all your problems. Do you know what happens after 2021 when the EU
stops DST switching?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two centuries of short-sighted propaganda and long-term chaos in
forty-five minutes. Maybe that will make you want to avoid time zones in
your code altogether!&lt;/p&gt;

started in 1994 at a NIST workshop in Maryland. What was the world of
Python like in its first years? Did we have any clue whatsoever? A
joke-focused tour of early Python, heavy on question-and-answer.&lt;/p&gt;

Foundation and the global Python community welcome and encourage
participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect,
tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live
up to these principles. We want our community to be more diverse:
whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversity, big deal! As an active members and event organisers (and also
on the minority side of the gender) in the Python community, we have
alway been concern by the question of: Do we truly have a problem in
diversity? Especially, gender diversity. We would like to find out the
truth, by data science, and see if we can find a clue why and how we can
fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we will show the research others did regarding the representation
of women in the R and Python communities [1]. Then, we will show the
research that we did based on our experience and statistic. Including
static analysis of the speakers diversity (regarding gender) at major
PyCon and PyData conferences. Finally, as we all care about diversity
and want improvements, we would like to find out the reason and what we
can do about it. We would propose what we, the minorities and allies,
could do against this seemingly unbalance situation and make the
community better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for all that who cares about diversity in our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology is to take script written in a high-level language (Python), analyze its inputs/outputs, images or graphs display, other interactions with the user and build connectors to this script from Chat Apps like Slack, Skype, and others. Imagine that you described your skill as a script and gave it to a software robot. And from that moment it is his skill, you and your colleagues can ask him any time to run this skill and give results. As a script author, you don't think about how to connect with different Chat Apps, how to control access, how to monitor that script works fine when colleagues run it, how to save logs, how to balance load if there are too many colleagues running script and so on, our platform does all of this so the author doesn't need to think about what is that software robot, how it works, the platform will understand script by itself. The author just drop script to the platform and tell to the platform which colleagues have the right to run this script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For teams who are in charge of Servers, Applications, API's, Data Bases, Analytical reports and other information technology items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tasks like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to fetch diagnostic information from multiple data sources into Chat App, gather metrics/logs and analyzing them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to take an action in case of incident right from a Chat App, rerouting users requests, server rebooting, launching new instances, and many other actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to give easy access via Chat App to APIs for team members and other coleagues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to provide analytical reports by the request from Chat App, reports with graphs, images, tables, files, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things are trivial to automate and share, you can do much more with Python, Chat App and smart script sharing platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, quantum computing was largely reserved for researchers, physicists, and scientists with direct access to physical quantum computing systems. But the game has changed, thanks to the cloud. Barriers to quantum computing are coming down quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, cloud access (like D-Wave’s Leap 2 quantum application environment) and improvements in quantum computing hardware, software, and developer tools are allowing programmers around the world to code on live quantum computers in real-time. Developers, students, and researchers around the world can now tap into the power of a quantum via their browser — quantum mechanical knowledge not required. Users and private companies have already built over 200 early applications on D-Wave’s computers in industries ranging from automotive to machine learning, aerospace, finance, and beyond. The quantum application era is here, and the growing quantum developer community is making it a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Alex Condello, Manager of Applications Development Technology and Tools at D-Wave Systems, will talk about the burgeoning quantum application development ecosystem, and how developers can start learning to code on a quantum computer today. This includes a walkthrough of Leap 2, D-Wave's new quantum cloud service equipped with hybrid solvers, and D-Wave's Ocean SDK. Alex will also explore some of the early applications that developers and companies have built to-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;due to COVID-19(Coronavirus disease 2019), we changed our life, social, and our community. most of us are engineer/organizer/designer/contributor with passion to communicate to everyone who has similar background. in COVID-19 disease, we are forced to reduce social event for keeping safe. in case from China/Korea/Malaysia.... we can see the number is decreasing and be controlled after each government announced new policy: Face masked, Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation. it meant we can not go to some place to hangout like usual, of course we have a lot of SMS tools/platform/media to keep relationship with our love, but for community, we easily lost our passion. and now, I want to share some doing/status of communities in Asia or other region I knew during/after COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I work with these teams, I notice that there are two factors that make all the difference between a good organization and one that is changing the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is having a culture of collaboration – and this means collaboration across individuals, across departments, and across teams – really - it’s a culture that’s less about competition and cutthroat political systems.. And more about helping each other achieve the extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second quality is organizations that treat and expect their employees to act like owners. Owning not just their behaviors, actions, and responsibilities, but owning outcomes and becoming a voice for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter where your organization is at today, the good news is– there are proven strategies to create a culture of collaborative ownership at your organization and that’s what I’m going to teach you in this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll share how you can build momentum from a carefully crafted vision and goals, I’ll help you improve communication and drive ownership, I’ll help you foster creativity, and finally, I’ll help you train up leaders in your organization and help you meet more of your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re ready to transform your organization. let’s go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEARNING OBJECTIVES:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn: How to transform a command-obey dynamic to one of creativity and innovation through opportunities for ownership. How to collaborate with opportunities for ownership through proven methods to increase connectivity and engagement in the team. How to foster captainship within your organization. How to apply the ideas of collaborative ownership specifically in individual organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SESSION OUTLINE: Fostering an Ownership Culture (Creativity and Innovation)- Ownership Activity -Fostering a Collaborative Culture- Collaborative Activity - Fostering Captainship Culture - Captainship activity- The Application of Collaborative Ownership for Personal and Organizational Success- Applying Collaborative Ownership to Organizations and Self Activity -Conclusion Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing API guidelines is a best practice for standardizing APIs produced by thousands of service provider, but what happens when those rules are not backed by internet standards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk proposes an iterative strategy for identify and standardize inside IETF key features of your API guidelines.
The steps includes feature landscaping, stakeholder identification and engagement, prototyping and writing an actual internet-draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy is shown using two examples:
- rewriting of &lt;cite&gt;Digest&lt;/cite&gt; header RFC3230 adding clarifications useful for implementors;
- proposing new &lt;cite&gt;RateLimit&lt;/cite&gt; headers and engage with implementors (Microsoft, Red Hat, Kong, ..).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been planning the EuroPython 2020 conference in Dublin, Ireland ever since late in 2019, when we ran the CFP. In March, it became apparent that the COVID-19 crisis would not be over by July 2020 and so we had to make a hard decision to either drop the event for 2020 or go online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we wanted to support the community even in difficult times, we decided to go for the online version -- even though this would be much less engaging than the in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past months, we have been creating a concept for the conference from scratch. The talk will present our approach, how it came to be and which challenges we faced. The concept should be usable by other conference as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python communities around the world, large and small are facing loss - from the loss of in person meetups and conferences to the loss of employment and even the potential loss of health and life. As communities we are all confronting uncertainty and unanswered questions. In this talk I would like to reflect on some of those questions. What are communities doing now to preserve a sense of community in the face of this crisis? What might we do and what options will we have for coming events? How can we build and foster community and still keep everyone safe? What challenges might we all face in the future? What sources of support can we find? What are our sources of optimism and hope?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wealth of amazing tools freely available to open source software developers to use to maintain their projects. Practically every problem we face or are likely to face in software development has been lived through and solved many times over. Patterns emerge for dealing with development practises and we build our software using the tools made by the previous generation of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're very fortunate to operate in an amazing open source ecosystem where we've learned we're stronger when we build on each other's foundations. We're constantly laying new foundations for ourselves and we share our ways of working with the world. We now have a very sophisticated set of tools for developing, managing, testing and documenting our new projects without reinventing the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we don't discover all the tools at once - we pick them up as we go along, as we find uses for them and we hear about them. I'm going to share a range of great tools I use to maintain some popular open source Python projects, and explain how the difference they've made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software packaging and distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Licensing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git &amp;amp; GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributor community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project management tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk demonstrates examples for development of Python projects on Linux, but the tools can be used cross-language and cross-platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dr. Greg Turner (the Interaction Consortium)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our web development work for Galleries, Libraries, Archives
and Museums (the so-called GLAM sector), we have open-sourced the common
tools and design patterns that we have developed as a web framework
called GLAMkit (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://glamkit.org/"&gt;http://glamkit.org/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GLAMkit is based on Django, and is inspired by its design philosophy of
several apps which implement specific features. However, by looking at
the successes and challenges faced by other CMSes and collections of
apps such as Pinax, we have taken the philosophy a stage futher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than being a collection of Django apps, we have constructed
GLAMkit as a collection of optional and reusable Django 'toolkits' for
implementing common features. We leave the implementation details - the
things that Django already does brilliantly - to the application
developers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will present the history of GLAMkit's development, with
particular focus on how our approach to reusability came about, and some
examples of that approach.&lt;/p&gt;

Deutschland organisiert, und versteht sich als Support-Organ der
gesamten deutschsprachigen Python-Community. 2011 hat sich der PySV
langsam aber sicher organisatorisch aus dem früheren DZUG e.V., der
bereits vollständig aus Python Enthusiasten bestand, emanzipiert und
seine Neustrukturierung im letzten Jahr weitgehend abgeschlossen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die wichtigsten Mittel zur Unterstützung der Community sind u. a. unsere
aktiven Mitglieder und die PySV-Website als zentraler Anlaufpunkt und
der neue Usergruppen-Hub. Der PySV unterstützte und organisierte bereits
die Python-Konferenzen PyCon.DE 2011 und 2012 als verantwortlicher
Partner mit. Auch die PyCon.DE 2013 wird er in enger Zusammenarbeit mit
der Kölner PyCologne Usergroup und dem DLR ermöglichen. In den Jahren
2014 und 2015 wird der PySV sogar Mitausrichter der EuroPython – der
größten europäsichen Python-Konferenz – sein. Die Berliner Usergroup mit
dem PySV im Rücken konnte sich in der Bewerbung durchsetzen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auch kleinere, aber deswegen nicht unwichtigere Events unterstützt der
PySV. Neben dem mittlerweile schon traditionellen PythonCamp in Köln
sind das verschiedene Python-Sprints und u.A. der World Plone Day an
mehreren Orten. Auf Messen wie der CeBIT, der überregionalen FrOSCon
Konferenz und den Berliner und Chemnitzer Linuxtagen und dem Linuxtag in
Berlin sorgt der Verband dafür, dass Python regelmäßig präsent ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Der gemeinsam neu entwickelte Programmierwettbewerb nimmt Formen an.
Studenten erhalten vom PySV Unterstützung für die Teilnahme an der
EuroSciPy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wie der Verband der Community helfen kann, wird mit allen, die mithelfen
wollen, gemeinsam erarbeitet. Er bietet organisatorische, finanzielle
und technische Hilfe für Usergruppen, Sprints und Workshops mit
Python-Bezug. Alle Python-Enthusiasten sind eingeladen im Verein aktiv
mitzuarbeiten. Neue Ideen und Verbesserungsvorschläge sind immer gern
gesehen. Unsere Grundregel lautet: “Soviel Unterstüzung wie möglich, so
wenig Reglementierung wie möglich.”&lt;/p&gt;

extremely complex, blockchain systems themselves are relatively easy to
understand when viewed from a distance. To take the example of Bitcoin,
users store digital currency in hardware or software wallets, and use
private keys to sign and broadcast transactions. Broadcasted
transactions are grouped together into a block through a cryptographic
process known as mining, with miners rewarded through the collection of
transaction fees and the issuance of new coins. The mined block of
transactions is appended to the existing chain, and verified by a global
network of nodes. This process repeats in perpetuity, with each newly
added block adding to the trustedness and security of data stored on the
chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased interest in and demand for cryptocurrencies has brought about
a need for places where digital assets can easily be bought, sold or
traded. Our platform, Bitpanda, accomplishes this with a backend written
in Python, and relying heavily on Django and MySQL databases. In our
presentation, we begin by providing a brief overview of how blockchains
work. Following this, we describe the Python architecture that (e.g.)
generates cryptocurrency wallets, builds, signs and sends transactions,
and monitors blockchains for new, relevant data. Key challenges,
solutions and failures encountered during the development of the system,
and growth of our team, are presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout our talk, we also highlight a number of broader social
implications of blockchains, and our work with them. More specifically,
we describe the need for open-innovation based approaches to blockchain
development, the value of open-source within the blockchain community,
and the current lack of critical discourse surrounding the potential
uses of blockchains as mechanisms of surveillance and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will introduce the audience to the concepts and ideas
behind the Binder project. I will showcase examples from the community
to illustrate use-cases and show off the power of Binder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three pieces of software power Binder:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;repo2docker&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;BinderHub&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"&gt;JupyterHub&lt;/a&gt;. Using an
example repository I will go through the steps required to make a
repository binder- ready and what happens when a user launches it. At
each step I will illustrate the role that each of the three software
components play and how they interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binder is a project created by its community. I will present pathways
for getting involved with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap up I will highlight plans for future developments and features
of Binder.&lt;/p&gt;

further growth? How do we allow it to keep expanding without further
damaging the community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all questions we ask ourselves everyday in the OpenStack
community and that we’ve managed to work on without killing ourselves on
the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reveals hands-on experience about the organisational journey,
including insider details and financial questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information is packed into the story, how one year ago a tempting
idea of making a little Python conference in Munich was born. Six month
later, with poor German skills, no business network and mostly foreign
crew a little idea was converted into PyCon.DE. This conference had a
noticeable Italian flavour, and it’s time to tell why.&lt;/p&gt;

consente allo sviluppatore di scrivere applicazioni complesse in tempi
brevissimi. Lo scopo del framework è di mettere a disposizione un
potente costruttore di GUI web, un ORM molto facile, veloce ed intivo ed
una serie di component che rendono possibile costruire la propria
applicazione in poche righe di codice. A questo si aggiungono tools di
amministrazione per la gestione di permessi, grafici, gestione del
workflow, gestore di stampe e molti altri che fanno di Genropy
un’ambiente usabile immediatamente in produzione anche in situazioni
complesse e critiche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbiamo cominciato a scrivere Genropy nel 2005 e durante il primo Pycon
qui a Firenze nel 2007, abbiamo ne abbiamo mostrato la primissima
versione. Da allora, ogni edizione di Pycon è stata l’occasione per
presentare le nuove features e cercare di diffondere la copnoscenza di
questo framework . A distanza di 10 anni possiamo dire che esiste una
minuscola ma molto attiva community che utilizza Genropy come strumento
quotidiano per scrivere le proprie applicazioni web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In questo talk vorremmo raccontarvi questa avventura, e darvi modo di
conoscere meglio Genropy e di capire se può essere anche per voi il
vostro nuovo modo di scriverre applicazioni web.&lt;/p&gt;

number of Python enthusiasts from different parts of the globe have been
working so hard to promote the use of Python in Africa by setting up a
vibrant community on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I will share on the various Python initiatives taking place
in some parts of the African continent and how they have advanced the
use of Python in Africa. I will also present the challenges faced by
developers in Africa in building their Python community. My talk will
also present the milestones that have been achieved so far in trying to
advance the use of Python in Africa. I will also share on the
opportunities that Africa presents in terms of making an impact within
the Python community. I will conclude my talk by highlighting ways in
which we can all make a difference in advancing the use and knowledge of
Python in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPython, what’s CPython. CPython is the official implementation of
Python, written in C. And it’s not just a implementation, it is a group
of volunteers and where they daily work on the project but there is no
many active contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPython, what’s CPython. CPython is the official implementation of
Python, written in C. And it’s not just a implementation, it is a group
of volunteers and where they daily work on the project but there is no
many active contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I would like to prove to you than you can become an active
contributor of CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core developers of CPython need your help, for example, with the
review of some patches, you can comment a patch or try to reproduce a
bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, when you wanted to contribute to CPython, you had to use
the bug tracker interface and send a patch, this patch was reviewed if
you were lucky and after commented etc…. but this process was really
long and time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the new process based on GitHub and Git, you can create a new
branch on your local repository and just send a Pull Request. The Pull
Request is just awesome, it will be reviewed really quickly, we will
comment your Pull Request and if the code is correct and the tests pass,
then you PR will be merged in CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love and need your Pull Requests for CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="audience"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Audience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For new comers to CPython and the future contributors and of course for
the regular contributors and core-dev of CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this migration to GitHub, I will show the work done by the
migration team, the benefits of this migration and the new
tools/workflow. Few tools have been developed to help the core-dev. For
example, Miss Islington has been developed for an automatic back-port of
a branch from Python ‘master’ to Python 3.6 or 3.5, just with a “label”
on the Pull Request&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show some stats about the contributors and the contributions on
the CPython project. For example, in November 2017, 4207 pull requests
from the community since the migration in Feb 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is explained with a story “Once upon a time” and with humour.&lt;/p&gt;

by email or at conferences, or indirectly, when we create products,

of error, and worse, bias. This can lead us to make communities and
products that work poorly for people that are different from ourselves,
introduce confusion and misunderstanding, exclude people
unintentionally, and sometimes even cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our communities are an opportunity to learn as well. To embrace
our diversity, and expand our understanding of other people’s worlds. To
gain understanding of other people’s situations, experiences and
emotions, which can be dramatically different to ours. And how we can
use this to create both products and communities which work great not
only for ourselves, but also those that we more easily forget about. As
creators in tech we have such tremendous power to create change, but
merely our best intentions will not be enough for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore how and why we sometimes have such difficulty to
understand others, and how others can have difficulty to understand us.
We’ll talk about why other people’s experiences, emotion and perceptions
can be so different. Both for the world as a whole, but also with the
speaker’s personal experiences. Finally, we’ll cover specific ways for
us to understand others better, and associated pitfalls, to make our
communities and products happy, inviting and supportive places.&lt;/p&gt;

industriale anche in funzione della necessità di avere operai
specializzati, una volta formato l’operaio svolgeva pressoché la stessa
mansione per tutta la vita. Dalla Rivoluzione Industriale a oggi, il
lavoro si è evoluto in modo considerevole. Tuttavia, queste grandi
trasformazioni del passato sono state graduali, mentre oggi i
cambiamenti sono repentini, trasversali e dirompenti. La formazione
scolastica è rimasta ancorata a schemi tradizionali. Il fine ultimo
della scuola dovrebbe essere quello di fare uscire ragazzi
intraprendenti e capaci di trarre soddisfazione dallo stesso
apprendimento, e le esperienze di alternanza scuola-lavoro nelle aziende
assumono un ruolo importante per la loro formazione, per le soft skill,
per mantenere alto l’interesse, per rendere lo studente protagonista e
consapevole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questa è la storia di un gruppo di studenti di un istituto tecnico
superiore, appassionati di Python e provenienti da esperienze di
alternanza e di partecipazione alle conferenze di comunità, che hanno
immaginato di sviluppare autonomamente Panino Digitale, un’applicazione
basata sul framework Django, con cui gli studenti possano prenotare il
panino al bar della scuola. Per realizzarla concretamente, hanno
coinvolto i loro docenti, condiviso l’idea con la loro comunità
scolastica, raccolto nuovi contributori tra i loro compagni, e chiesto
supporto, affiancamento e strumenti alla community Python e ai suoi
membri.&lt;/p&gt;

a $500 travel stipend available to them. Interns work remotely with
mentors from Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities on
projects not limited to just programming but also user experience,
documentation, illustration and graphical design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently interning with Fedora under the Outreachy program, where
my task is to is to develop administrative tools for the 389 Directory
Server, an enterprise class LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
server, used in businesses globally to authenticate and identify people.
LDAP is a standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining
distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol
(IP) network. I am helping Fedora improve the Directory Servers Python
command line tools. In addition to this, the team at Fedora is also
investigating into integrating existing C code with Rust (watch here:
Integrating Rust with existing C) to improve performance and
maintainability. Hence, I am also working on establishing proof of
concept for using Rust instead of C and also using Rust with existing C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with fixing bugs in the Directory Server and it enabled me to
get more understanding about LDAP concepts, since LDAP has a steep
learning curve. My first task was to add the command line support for
automember plugin to the Directory Server. Automembership allows a
static group to act like a dynamic group, for adding new members to the
group. Different automembership definitions create searches that are
automatically run on all new directory entries. The automembership rules
search for and identify matching entries and then explicitly add those
entries as members to the group. I started by added the classes (Auto
Membership Plugin, Auto Member Definition, Auto Member Definitions),
methods and the tests for these classes and methods (Pull Request). Then
I added the support for automember by command line which included
creating, removing, editing and showing the automember definitions. This
included writing the tests as well. By the end of this task, I learnt
about Python decorators, lazy evaluation in Python, using pytest testing
tool and writing command line parser and arguments using the argparse
library. (This will be shown with live coding and screenshots).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on another task which involves building an LRU
cache in Rust which stores C allocated strings and can retrieve them.
This project will be built using the meson build system. I will also
provide tests and asan builds. This task will act as a proof of concept
for investigating if meson can replace autotools as the Directory Server
build system. During this task, I hope to learn about build systems, LRU
caching concept and Rust types and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can deduce from my tasks and the key learnings, doing this
Outreachy internship with Fedora is helping me to stand at the forefront
of technology, learning about LDAP, Python and Rust (polyglot!), which
will definitely enable me to become a better programmer and a
collaborative community member for Fedora. And I hope to inspire other
underrepresented people in tech with my talk about the Outreachy
internship and my progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most engineers who get promoted to the role of a team lead, tech lead or
lead developer (regardless of the wording of the title) feel like they
were thrown in cold waters as they, most probably, lack prior training
or education on the subject matter. Most of us that survive and actually
get to like the new role and arrive at really good results, manage to
educate themselves on the skills and habits required to become an
effective team leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will cover the most important lessons about being an
effective team lead without any previous knowledge about the subject.
This is a practical talk and the audience will walk away with a lot of
material and advice to upgrade their engineering leadership game, as
well as a recommended set of resources for further study. The talk is
primarily focused on developing leadership skills and is tailored
towards engineers and software teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The learning goals are: - How to develop practical leadership skills for
your day-to-day job - Understand the core components of leadership: ATM
(Ability, Team, Mission) - How to build teamwork on a foundation of
trust - How to overcome the main dysfunctions to look in order to
tighten up your team - Increase your awareness of the main anti-patterns
that team leads end up doing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as in code, in our daily life we have patterns that can be
returning patterns. Can we debug our life, via debugging skills we
learned in coding? Come to experience this talk to learn how to debug
your life! In daily life we have patterns and even returning patterns,
at least if you take time to recognize some parts happening in your
life. This can be in your career, customer relations, and even in
personal and family relations. Nice patterns lead to success and
inspiration. Bad pattens leads to bore-out, burn-out or even worse… In
this talk Dennie and special guest speaker Miriam – a well-known Belgian
speaker and experience expert in Autism – will take you on a journey
where they explain life patterns via metaphors in the tech/ developer
world. You will learn how to recognize life patterns exactly as in code,
engineering, and business patterns. When you recognize the patterns it’s
finally time to learn to debug those patterns! Just as you debug code
patterns with changing the source code, you learn to debug life patterns
via changing lifestyle, and in specific thoughts. As you see, those are
just the same. Slides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is for those people who know basic python but are looking
forward to writing better and cleaner python code. Python has always
been known for its easy-to-understand syntax. This talk will empower all
developers and give perspective on how can you write code in a much more
elegant way. Linting is the automated checking of your source code for
programmatic and stylistic errors. Linters analyze source code to flag
programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.
This is done by using a lint tool. Python being one of the most elegant
language has got a wide variety of listing tools available that can help
programmers in Code formatting and styling their code in the best
suitable form. Python has got some advance listing tools like pylint and
flake8. In this talk we will have a great deal of discussion around how
these linters can be used and how these tools can help you find more
bugs and improve your code quality. These linting tools finds problems
that are typically caught by a compiler for less dynamic languages. We
will also discuss about how can we manage import orders, code
formatting, checking security vulnerabilities, managing dependencies etc
using these tools. There are also code analysis tools that provide other
insights into your code. While maybe not linters by definition, these
tools are usually used side-by-side with linters. They too hope to
improve the quality of the code. It’s useful to have linters run against
your code frequently. If automation and consistency aren’t there, it’s
easy for a large team or project to lose sight of the goal and start
creating lower-quality code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will be able to learn 1. What is a linter? 2. Famous linting
solutions like pylint and flake 8 3. Use cases like ordering imports,
finding error bugs 4. Managing dependency in python with these linter
tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, a paper is published to demonstrate how a visibly valid
contribution can contain malicious code by exporting the Unicode control
characters. Some of these attacks has been tested on Python and it
works. Shall the Python and open-source communities be concerned?
Background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After researchers at the University of Cambridge published a paper(
about a malicious attack named Trojan Source, which exploited the fact
that some program interpreters, like CPython, can handle Unicode. This
has caused concerns in the open-source community about the malicious
contribution that looks totally legitimate in human eyes but contain
invisible attacks. As a member of the Python community, we should all be
aware of that and understand how we can prevent this attack to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About this talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Cheuk will decode the finding in this paper to a level
that can be understood by everyone. She will start with a joke example
who you can mess up someone by using Unicode. She will then explain what
is Unicode and why it causes trouble. Afterwards, she will explain the
Python examples( in the paper and why it can be dangerous. Lastly, she
will open up a discussion on how we should defend ourselves from those
attacks and what we can do as a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline (30 mins talk):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**5 minutes - Introduction, the opening of the talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Cheuk will ask audiences to debug a code snippet that
looks absolutely fine but will not work as code. She will explain that
this is the same concept used in Trojan Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**10 mins - What is Unicode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Cheuk will give an introduction about what is Unicode,
what it is to a computer and why we need Unicode in computers. She will
also explain how the benefit of having Unicode can also be a downfall to
make us vulnerable to the Trojan Source attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**10 mins - How Trojan Source works in Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Cheuk will show a few examples using the Trojan Source
in legitimate Python code. She will point out how the attack is hiding
in the source code and in what cases it can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**5 mins - How to protect ourselves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Cheuk will open the discussion and make a few
suggestions of how we can protect ourselves as a community. This will
lead to the Q&amp;amp;A session where the audience can weigh in on their own
thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target audiences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From those who are curious to maintainers of open-source libraries. This
is the knowledge we should all know and be aware of. Cheuk will explain
in a way that expects no prior knowledge is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will audiences learn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About Trojan Source attacks and how it works. They may also learn about
how interpreters, especially Python interpreters, works with Unicode.
Plus, they may have increased awareness about security in the
open-source world.&lt;/p&gt;

Python community. Making Python the best language it can be is not
merely helped by increasing diversity, but may be dependent on
diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Guilherme Chapiewski; Henrique Bastos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we are Python lovers, we at PythOnRio (Python's Rio de
Janeiro users group) strongly believe in differences. Programming
languages and technologies are not religions. Why do we have to compete
against each other when we can take advantage of diversity by sharing
our knowledge and learning to use the best tools for each job? By
promoting this thinking we are gathering people from many different open
source communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's our main recipe for the success of initiatives like Coding Dojo
Rio, PythOnCampus, Dev in Rio, #horaextra and many other social meetings
where we have gathered some of the smartest people in Rio's software
development community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this philosophy, Rio de Janeiro communities are growing and
starting to jell - they are becoming so strongly knit that the whole is
greater than the sum of the parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we would like to share not only our &amp;quot;methods&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;formulas&amp;quot;, but the values and experiences that are leading us to build
a strong and active community while having lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

into a thriving community with code sprint and regular meetings

group and will highlight the key factors behind its success with the
hope to inspire others to replicate that accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talk will first walk the audience through the factors inherent to
Montréal itself and how it affected other user groups before
Montréal-Python. These groups inspired us to get a group of Python
hackers started the presentation will show how we were able to leverage
on the success of other user groups to bring our young community
forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various stages of our growth will be presented along with insights
on how we managed to find speakers and venues at each point. The
presentation will then go through an overview of our current activities,
sharing in the process how effective they are in engaging the community.
Our plans for the next few years will be presented then a summary will
provide advice to anyone who would like to get started organizing a
local Python user group.&lt;/p&gt;

As the Python ecosystem has grown, so have the volunteer efforts. However, some jobs are of a scale where they can’t reasonably be asked of a volunteer. The PSF also has an important role in financially supporting the Python community. In this keynote, we’ll see how the Python community is growing, what new challenges that brings, and how we can sustainably address them, so that the PSF can continue its mission to grow and nurture our community.&lt;/p&gt;
