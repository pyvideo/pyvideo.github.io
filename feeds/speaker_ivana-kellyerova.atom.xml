the standard library can do basically anything except for maybe conjure
bacon for you (though I heard that's coming in 3.8). I don't think we
fully appreciate the sheer vastness of it, though, so I went through it
module by module looking for hidden gems (sorry, eggs). This is a by no
means exhaustive compilation of the useful, the underrated, and the
funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the Python standard library, chances are you use it on
a daily basis -- or more likely, a more or less stable subset of it. The
usual way we add things to the subset is by looking for a solution to a
problem and ending up getting pointed to a standard library module.
That, however, means that the odds of you finding out that there is a
whole module whose sole purpose is to tell you if a string is a Python
keyword are very slim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this talk is to showcase CPython libraries that are
interesting in some way: mostly for their usefulness, but in some cases
simply for being wonderfully weird in some way. The talk is not aimed at
any particular level of Python experience - as a beginner you'll get a
taste of just how many batteries Python ships with, and as a person
using the language often you might end up growing your own personal
subset a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
