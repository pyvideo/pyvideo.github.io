_potential_ to do great things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are the things we're doing with computers, overall, _actually_ great?
What is the _purpose_ of computers?  Why do we build software for them?  How
can we do it better?  And: should we be making anything other than video
games?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Glyph will answer those questions, and more; some of his
proposed answers might surprise you.  He will present extensive digressions
on the history of the craft and industry of software development, the impact
that recent events have had on the course of that history, and he will
contemplate new directions which might lead toward a brighter tomorrow.
Along the way, he will consider what lessons we might learn from the
progression of other, similar fields, such as medieval church architecture
and nuclear power generation.&lt;/p&gt;

But
as we also know, no test plan survives contact with the real world.
Complex, distributed systems fail in complex, distributed ways, and even
the simplest web app today is a complex distributed system. So, as our
code accrues little fixes to bugs that only show up in production, our
test suites eventually either become slow integration testing
monstrosities that are &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot; but flaky and unreliable, or useless
piles of mocks which are fast and deterministic but don't give you
confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll explore how to leverage event-driven programming, or
&amp;quot;async I/O&amp;quot;, to structure code in such a way that its tests are fast,
realistic, and reliable, even in the face of horrible race-conditions
you only discover in production.&lt;/p&gt;

which efficiently publish and consume services and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, we will combine 4 Python-based technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jupyter is a real-time development environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twisted is a powerful platform for network programming that supports
many protocols, including HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klein is a Twisted-based web application framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treq is a Requests-style HTTP client based on Twisted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining all of these we will guide students through &lt;em&gt;interactively
prototyping&lt;/em&gt; a production quality web application that &lt;em&gt;publishes&lt;/em&gt; both
&lt;em&gt;service APIs&lt;/em&gt; and web resources such as HTML, and that can &lt;em&gt;efficiently
consume many back-end services&lt;/em&gt; such as 3rd-party APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is a versatile language, available on a wide variety of platforms. However, when it comes to shipping code to users on those platforms, Python violates Zen Rule 13: “There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.”: there are a lot of ways to do it, and many of them are far from obvious.  In this talk I'll show you how to build Python code into something a user can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the SSL/TLS vulnerabilities in recent years, the landscape has improved considerably.  However, there’s still a lot of knowledge necessary to use TLS in Python properly, and a lot of useful information for setting up and debugging TLS stacks that’s hard to come by.  Join the makers of PyOpenSSL, the standard library’s ssl module, requests/urllib3, Twisted, the former maintainer of a CA, and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Glyph Lefkowitz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks about using Python for everything in a project and the
difficulties of using different non-Python-based things in your
deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Glyph</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:pyvideo.org,2011-09-05:djangocon-us-2011/djangocon-2011--keynote---glyph-lefkowitz.html</guid><category>djangocon</category><category>djangocon2011</category><category>keynote</category></item><item><title>Turtles All The Way Down: Demystifying Deferreds, Decorators, and Declarations (#169)</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2010/pycon-2010--turtles-all-the-way-down--demystifyin.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turtles all the way down: Demystifying deferreds, decorators and
declarations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented by Glyph Lefkowitz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python's flexible object model allows library and framework authors to
add very flexible declarations. Metaclasses, decorators, callable
objects, and operator overloading practically allow libraries to
re-define the language in order to provide a more concise, natural style
for that library. Unfortunately, the library user's first experience of
such conveniences is often confusing, because it's not clear what's
going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will try to convince you that all of this wonderful
magic isn't all that weird. This is not a typical how-to session on how
to use a particular feature, either of Python or of Twisted, but will
rather draw examples from Python, Twisted, and Zope to illustrate
techniques you can use to read and understand &amp;quot;magical&amp;quot; Python code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glyph Lefkowitz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Twisted event-driven networking engine is well-known in the Python
community. However, only a few of its features are widely understood.
This talk will be a brief conceptual introduction to Twisted, followed
by a survey of its features, their status, and how development has been
proceeding over the years, with a special focus on the last two years of
sponsored development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will begin with a brief introduction to Twisted architectural
concepts; a description of the event loop, connections, and timers. It
will then segue into the many different features that Twisted offers,
including command-line tools for running an out-of-the-box
zero-configuration HTTP server, DNS server, IRC server, and SMTP server.
This will also present the relative maturity and stability of each of
these areas of the code, with a special emphasis on what level of
expertise a developer should have before attempting to use them.
Finally, I will describe some of the features that have been added to
Twisted along the way, including some new and exciting developments that
have been happening recently.&lt;/p&gt;

a little bit. You've probably written some yourself. But do you really

when you call socket.send()? Come to this talk and find out: if you
dare.&lt;/p&gt;

least enough about events to write an 'onclick' handler. But events have
a reputation for being confusing. In this talk I'll explain why events
can be quite easy to understand if you think about them the right way,
and how to scale your understanding from trivial browser JavaScript to
distributed systems in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

an increasing obligation to serve that world well. Yet, we don't yet
have a sense of what makes a good ethical standard. The fast pace,
success, and youth (in both historical and demographic terms) of our
industry have given us the sense that such a standard might not be
required. This talk will correct that misconception.&lt;/p&gt;
