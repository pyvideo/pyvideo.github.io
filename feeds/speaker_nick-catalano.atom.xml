Cool News&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday 2 p.m.--2:45 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience level: Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear how in under 2 weeks Ain't it Cool News, a movie news and review
website with over 15 years of raw HTML content and hundreds of thousands
of daily visits, was moved from an expensive custom Ruby on Rails App on
an EC2 cluster to a dedicated server running Django. All with zero
downtime. Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2012 the movie website Ain't It Cool News was in a rut-
advertising revenues were going down while their custom Ruby on Rails
solution on EC2 seems to require more and more system administration and
hosting resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear how by using django a website with over a decade of raw HTML
content, 4.5 million comments and hundreds of thousands of daily visits
was moved from EC2 to a single managed server running Django behind the
Cloudfront CDN with no downtime at a significantly reduced monthly cost.&lt;/p&gt;
