more than 90 scientific institutions world-wide. Indico provides a
multitude of features to conference/meeting organizers, merging the
capabilities of a powerful CMS with a calendaring layer, thus allowing
users to keep track of past and future meetings, and to quickly access
all the resources concerning a particular event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indico is an open source content management system developed at the
European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and currently used in
more than 90 scientific institutions world-wide. Indico provides a
multitude of features to conference/meeting organizers, merging the
capabilities of a powerful CMS with a calendaring layer, thus allowing
users to keep track of past and future meetings, and to quickly access
all the resources concerning a particular event. Other very useful
features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference registration &amp;amp; e-payment integration;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paper/abstract reviewing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with chat (XMPP) systems;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with videoconferencing/webcasting applications;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Room booking module;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag&amp;amp;drop; timetable editing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event reminders &amp;amp; alarms (scheduler);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensible via plugin subsystem;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At CERN alone, Indico serves a community of around 10.000 users, with
~15.000 different visitors per day (~1 M hits). It hosts more than
150.000 events, made of around 700.000 individual contributions/talks
and ~900.000 files. It has become part of &amp;quot;CERN speech&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;look it up on
Indico&amp;quot; is almost as obvious as &amp;quot;Google it&amp;quot; around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Indico is as well an indispensable tool in the realm of High Energy
Physics, going far beyond the borders of this organization. Institutions
such as Fermilab, MIT and IHEP (China) are using it for their own
meetings/conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is fully written in Python and JavaScript, using ZODB as its
database back-end. It is a perfect example of how Python-related
technologies can be used to build powerful web applications that empower
scientific research and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
