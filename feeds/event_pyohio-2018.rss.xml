He has ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), of which
there is no cure. Feeling powerless in the face of disease, I set out to
do what I could: Build tech to ease his suffering, to help him feel more
connected with his loved ones, and to share what I'm building for free.
This is my story.&lt;/p&gt;

Python provides
regular expressions via the built in ‘re’ module, but they are hard to
read, write, and understand. This talk will give you two tools conquer
regex’s, a mental model, (demonstrated with props), of how they work,
and a mini- language, “Simple Regex Language”, to create readable
regex’s that easily translate into Python regex's.&lt;/p&gt;

States have some kind of disability, and not including them limits your
reach. But once you've heard about the basics, how do you get started?
In this talk, I'll walk you through the process of finding issues in
your site, and discuss processes to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

late 80's in the parking lot of a Rax Roast Beef restaurant for $20.
This started a nostalgic journey assisted by NumPy matrix slices and a
can of WD-40. This talk will cover how I used Python to overcome three
decades of history to get it printing again.&lt;/p&gt;

Although considered a scripting language, Python can create graphical
user interfaces (GUIs) for your applications. GUI controls can be laid
out programmatically or organized using a rapid application development
(RAD) tool such as Glade. Come see how to build GUIs with Python and
Glade.&lt;/p&gt;

something like this: A &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot; app is deployed and massively
scaled up using some kind of magic framework or API. Nothing short of a
magic trick, we usually feel impressed but have no idea what just
happened. This talk is an intro to containers as explained by a Python
dev for Python devs, without the magic tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

styles across multiple code bases (style guides/pattern libraries).
Maintaining these styles becomes quite a task, and causes increasing
frustration overtime. Fortunately it doesn’t have to be this way, and in
this talk for designers and engineers, we’ll discuss how.&lt;/p&gt;

I learned
about coding by watching my dad and asking questions. To me coding is
like a “sport” and I think lots of kids would like to code if they had a
chance to learn and build things. I’d like to tell you how I got
started, and show some of the projects I’ve built. Then you can have
ideas on how to help other kids get started.&lt;/p&gt;

The cost
savings? The developer story? Because it's shiny and new? In this talk I

choosing a serverless architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

Sphinx is like Python’s secret weapon. It’s a powerful, mature system

impossible. Start with proven advice from this talk!&lt;/p&gt;

From simple ones in our
personal lives, to terribly complex ones in our daily work, we could all
benefit from automating these workflows. Airflow is the mechanism with
which we can do this. In this talk, we will explore what Airflow is, and
how we can leverage it to automate some of the tedium out of our daily
lives.&lt;/p&gt;

They're often weak and reused, making them one of the
least secure parts of web applications. This is such a problem that
entire industries of password managers and two-factor authentication
products have popped up as extra layers of security. To really address
this issue and make our users and products more secure, we need a more
fundamental change.&lt;/p&gt;

still haven't made the switch to Python 3. This talk is for anyone
facing a 2-to-3 migration that they'd like to feel more confident about.
Attendees will leave with the outline of a migration plan, some
suggested focus areas, a knowledge of helpful tools, and links to
resources they can use after the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

distribute Python software, what they are used for, why they exist, and
their history (including where their weird names come from). In
addition, we'll see how they all work together, what it takes to make
them work, and what the future has in store for Python packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

when we run into text data? In this tutorial, I will walk through the
steps to turn text data into a format that a machine can understand,
share some of the most popular text analytics techniques, and showcase
several natural language processing (NLP) libraries in Python including
NLTK, TextBlob, spaCy and gensim.&lt;/p&gt;

Publishing code is
necessary but not sufficient for complete reproducibility. Complex
programs often depend on external code. This talk will introduce you to
several ways to manage your software dependencies and data to pass
reproducible software environments to peer-reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

The same
is true of Python and becoming a professional developer or open source
contributor. Many people are 'learning to code' to switch careers, but
overlooking the other skills they'll need. New developers will learn the
when, why, and how of those other skills, while experienced devs can use
this as a roadmap for mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;

the mid-00s. In this talk, you'll learn about the tools I found to
modernize development, installation, and isolation as well as the
libraries that make building CLIs and working with the OS easy. We'll
cover Pipenv and how best to use it with setuptools, as well as Click
and other libraries useful for this task.&lt;/p&gt;

app. I didn’t know how it all worked, but after hours of hacking I had a
blogging app running. I imagine many share a similar learning
experience. Similarly, you don’t need a PhD to do deep learning, you can
get started with Python skills and open-source frameworks. It can be fun
and rewarding, and inspire you to dive deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

design patterns commonly used in enterprise languages, and shows the
features in Python that make these approaches unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
