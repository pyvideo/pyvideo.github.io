AIMS features collaborative project spaces, allowing users to analyze and compare their models in a standardized fashion. Model performance and various model metadata are automatically captured to facilitate provenance tracking and allow users to learn from and build on previous submissions. Additionally, AIMS allows users to deploy ML models built in Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow Keras, PyTorch, and ONNX into live REST APIs and automatically generated web apps with minimal code. The ability to deploy models with minimal effort and to make them accessible to non-technical end-users through web apps has the potential to make ML research more applicable to real-world challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
