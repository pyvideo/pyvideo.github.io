The vision of old school waterfall projects, with months of work
before integrating and releasing software to users gives me the
creeps. But let's return to the present. I can hardly even recall
working in a non-agile project. I feel that most of the Agile
manifesto principles are in my DNA more than a thing to follow. If
you want to keep growing in this industry you might want to start
building on top of that. This presentation contains my experience
about aligning people, sharing a direction, and how servant
leadership works.&lt;/p&gt;

have learned about Asyncio, profiling, optimization, debugging, and
operations... in a fast-moving environment where bugs actually cost
money.&lt;/p&gt;

analysis, focusing on when Dask is useful (and when you might be
better off simply using SQL or Pandas). We will cover how to build
and analyze directed acyclic graphs using Dask and how to easily set
up a cluster running Dask for your data wrangling needs.&lt;/p&gt;

Complaining
about instability might not always be enough. Especially when your
system depends on multiple networked services and each of them is on
a critical path to the final result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will recall why network failures happen. Reason what
we can and cannot handle in the code. And see what Python standard
libraries and a few popular ones such as urllib3 and requests can
offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's not all. Network Emulation (netem) module of Linux Traffic
Control (tc) can even help with poor network simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there is no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;

Are you a
Python fan interested in everything Python-related? Or would you
simply like to see a non-standard presentation? If you answered yes
at least once, then this funny and inspiring talk is right for you!
In less than 20 minutes, you'll hear from a young student-teacher
about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What coding skills are taught to beginners and how&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with teaching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few surprises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No technical knowledge is needed (some code samples will be shown,
but they're not essential). Discussion at the end is welcome. Looking
forward to seeing you!&lt;/p&gt;

conception one year ago. Amongst other things we at CommOps are
trying to build tools to understand the community and make it more
contributor-friendly. While newcomer onboarding is important for any
FOSS community, retaining them is critical. We have been working on
improving the contributor retention rates in Fedora Community for a
while now. In this direction, we have built some Python-based scripts
to understand the activity of Fedora contributors and their life
cycles. We have also tried to analyze contribution activity of some
successful contributors and find common patterns in their behavior
and have tried to measure the impact of attending FOSS events on the
activity of a contributor and on the Fedora community as a whole. All
this work has been done using Python and during this talk, I want to
share details about the tools we have built, how we built them and
the insights we have generated from them.&lt;/p&gt;

relatively small city of Tirana, the capital of Albania. Even fewer
girls were interested in Python. During our talk we will share the
story of how we, a small but dedicated group of people, jump started
the community in a small country like Albania and what other small
cities and countries should avoid during their first steps in
developing a Python community in similar conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important we will share tips and tricks on how to keep the
Python spirit alive for a long time after the first enthusiastic
steps, with the goal that our shared experience will help other
communities to make the first steps or grow even further. Also
nowadays we are witnessing that the number of girls involved in
technical fields, especially development, is really low and we are
going to present what as the influence on low participation of girls
and the steps we should take to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will introduce you to
the core concepts of data analysis with Python. We’ll cover libraries
that allow you to easily clean and set up your initial dataset,
importing data from all different file types and standards. We’ll
introduce some basic libraries to help with statistics and analysis
and then cover how to document and explore your findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s assumed you have a working understanding of Python and its data
types and structures, and that you’ve used and understand Python for
basic scripting. It’s also assumed you haven’t done much in terms of
data analysis, and you’d like to learn more. If this is you, welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

mnohdy nepochopitelně.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Přednáška ukazuje, jak lze začít tvořit a hrát si s jednoduchými
grafickými objekty bez znalostí programování. Společně definujeme
několik grafických objektů, které rozpohybujeme po grafickém plátně a

Those are never easy. Even though we all try to be nice to each
other, sometimes unintentionally we can be a bit off. I'd like to

correct them.&lt;/p&gt;

Some people have turned
cracking puzzles into a hobby and gave rise to events dedicated to
solving such problems – puzzlehunts. TMOU is the oldest and biggest
one among them. During these games, players regularly feel the
frustration from endless unsuccessful efforts, often quickly followed
by extraordinary joy after finally figuring out the peculiar problem.
This joy can only be surpassed by creating a perfect puzzle for
others to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will share a few lessons learnt while organizing TMOU, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes a problem seemingly impossible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to turn impossible into possible and hard into not-so-hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to crack tough problems and hammer down their complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Python might be a good hammer for that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the creation of a specific puzzle from an initial idea to the
final design (puzzle #4 &amp;quot;the Dice&amp;quot;, TMOU 17

because its implementation demonstrates the capabilities of function
objects. Finally, horetu can construct powerful interfaces and
detailed documentation from functions that were written with no
intent of being used with horetu; it is, consequently, a clear
demonstration of the merits of following conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyone who tried implementing
it realizes that often the problem is not to design or formally
specify the API (with Swagger or other tool). The problem is to keep
the specification, servers and clients consistent and easy to
maintain for longer. I will talk about what practices you need to
remember and which tools are worth to check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will start with the basics of microservices architecture. I
will describe some mistakes we have made that turned our
microservices architecture fragile and unmanageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show how we redesigned our API using Swagger and what
principles you should have in mind when doing so. I will also cover
technical problems we encountered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to test that a service implements an API;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to avoid writing validation that is already specified in the swagger file;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to create clients and stub and who should maintain them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As theory is not enough here, I will also show some tools that help,
describe in detail connexion library and show how we used it to
implement microservices integration tests &amp;#64;Growbots.&lt;/p&gt;

tests for it can be a tedious drag: asserting every single HTTP code,
set of headers, JSON responses, error states… you know the drill.
Despite all that you do, you still need to assure your API clients
won’t be exposed to any unexpected surprises. At Apiary, we've
developed an Open Source testing framework called Dredd, which has
baked in first-class Python support. It does all the heavy lifting
and boring stuff for you while allowing you to alter the test cases
with arbitrary Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let Judge Dredd do your API justice.&lt;/p&gt;

including operating aspects of systems and infrastructure through an
online chat. It combines a powerful way to get things done with a
more human way of working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t happen overnight. In this talk I would like to explain
various stages of adoption. I also want to inspire you to implement
ChatOps into your workflow and to suggest ideas how to do that. I
will show you why Python is the ideal language for building a ChatOps
stack. It is quick and fun to build new chat commands and even a
person who doesn’t know Python can easily start learning and see the
results immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

what changed in the last few years and what can we do about GIL in
everyday programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still a lot of misunderstanding regarding GIL, coming from
not-so-perfect documentation - not explaining the implications
thoroughly and in a simple way; it's also often outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, GIL's implementation changed a little in CPython 3.x that may
affect programmers' choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This misinformation may, in some cases, drive them away from CPython
where it's not really the worst choice. By providing comprehensive
guide to today's GIL in CPython, this presentation aims to help make
better design choices - be it choosing a concurrency/parallelism
model, Python implementation to use or even whether or not to drop
Python entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been (and still are), of course, attempts to get rid of
GIL and find another solution for the problem it solves - newest of
which is Larry Hasting's project called GILectomy, which I hope to
shed some light on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you write tests and you want them to be part of the project, run on your CI etc., but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the API is secured by a secret token/password/cookie...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the information on the webpage changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it's not even accessible from the wild web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you test it? You can mock the server part (that's messy),
you can spin off your own testing server (that's hard) or you can
record the HTTP communication with betamax (that's super simple).
I'll show you all the methods and their good, bad and ugly parts.&lt;/p&gt;

engagement. Communities, such as Github and PyPi, are host to
redundant projects and libraries. In the development space, how do
you distinguish your project from others, get people excited to
contribute to it, and ultimately create a successful open source
project? The answer is to apply user-centered design techniques to
the development of your project. User-centered design is usually
applied to web applications and products on the front-end of a
website, but these techniques can be applied to open source
libraries. In user-centered open source projects, your users are
those who type &lt;cite&gt;pip install $your_library&lt;/cite&gt;. In this talk, Jackie will
illustrate some user-centered techniques that have been used on her
own project - Mesa (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa"&gt;https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa&lt;/a&gt;), along with
other successful open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

use some proprietary IDE for development. Wouldn't it be better to
use some open source IDE like Eclipse or QtCreator? What should I do
when I'm working a project and can't start from the scratch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I'll show you how Python can help you with
porting projects. I'll give examples of projects developed in IAR
Embedded Workbench and Keil uVision. At the end we'll have CMake
build file which can be imported to many IDEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python modules like Objectify and Jinja will be a great help to us!&lt;/p&gt;

is critical. The application must be delivered properly to customers
and users. And with frequent releases, manual testing is exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore developers need integration and system tests, aside from
basic unit tests - to make sure their commits are integrated properly
and did not break anything. No more: one hotfix creates two new bugs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For beginners: I will give a brief introduction to software testing
and its types and talk about how easy is to start with writing
automatic tests in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For advanced: I will present integration testing of Cleerio web
mapping application (originally written in JavaScript and PHP) using
Python together with Selenium project.&lt;/p&gt;
