Data can easily be found on
open data portals or simply on Open Street Map. But how can we use this
data? What kind of tools are there to store and analyse this data in an
optimal manner? During this talk we will answer these questions. We will
discuss particularly about PostGIS, an extension of PostgreSQL database,
and GeoAlchemy, a Python library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at MIT, once said that &amp;quot;Every time we
invent something, we make it easier to invent something else&amp;quot;. That is
probably especially true in the digital space, given the pace at which
technology is evolving. While working on a pricing model that is
evaluating the price of apartments in Italy, based on information such
as location, size or status, we realized that it would be very useful to
have more information about the area where the apartments are located.
This helped us discover that finding open geospatial data is not very
difficult these days, but processing and storing it require some
particular skills and tools. PostGis is an open source extension of the
PostgreSQL Database Management system that allows users to store
geospatial data as specific data types (geometries and geographies). In
addition, it helps the user handle this data using some specific spatial
functions such as distance, area, etc. SQLAlchemy is a SQL library of
Python implementing an object-relational mapping concept. The advantage
of this library is that developers no longer need to write SQL queries
in their Python code when working with a database, but they can write
Python classes instead that are translated to SQL statements. GeoAlchemy
is an extension of SQLAlchemy that facilitates working with spatial
databases, such as PostGIS. During this talk we will shortly talk about
the use-case that required the use of the tools mentioned above and walk
you though an example using data from Open Street Map, stored in geojson
files. Our aim is to raise awareness in the audience about how
geospatial data can be manipulated and stored using Python and open
source database management systems. The talk is aimed at scientists and
developers interested in working with geospatial data using Python.
There are no advanced topics in the talk, but in order to get most of
the talk you should have some knowledge of Python and SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
