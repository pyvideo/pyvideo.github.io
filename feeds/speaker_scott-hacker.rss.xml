&lt;p&gt;Universities and other enterprises often deploy a complex mix of systems
for managing identities and permissions for students, faculty and staff.
Standard LDAP, Google Apps for Education/Enterprise, Student Information
Systems, hiring systems, CAS/Single Sign-On, and more must all work
together without conflicts or delays. At the California College of Arts,
we've created a Django-based system to help end-users and staff create
and manage identities, passwords, groups, permissions, and more. Scot
Hacker will demonstrate the system and provide a tour of its strictly
decoupled internals. The system is unusual in that it uses almost no
data modeling of its own, relying instead on communication via
python-ldap, Google and Workday APIs, and old-school file shuffling to
negotiate communications with other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
