But as recently as May of 2014 it was actually impossible at all to use Python 3 at Facebook. Come learn how we cut the Gordian Knot of dependencies and social aversion to the point where new services are now being written in Python 3 while older Python 2 projects are actively migrated to Python 3. All accomplished by a small group of individual contributors in their spare time. Learn to fight the good fight and upgrade your organization to Python 3 like we did at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, services built on Python 3.5 using asyncio are widely used at Facebook. But as recently as May of 2014 it was actually impossible to use Python 3 at Facebook. Come learn how we cut the Gordian Knot of dependencies and social aversion to the point where new services are now being written in Python 3 and existing codebases have plans to move to Python 3.5.  All without official support or sanction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Rules for Radicals&amp;quot; is a book for community organizers by the late Saul Alinsky on how to unite people to effect positive change in their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
