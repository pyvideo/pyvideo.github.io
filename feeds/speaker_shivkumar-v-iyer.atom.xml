challenge due to the non-linear nature of the circuit and the necessity
to model the associated control systems with each converter. Python
Power Electronics aims to provide a free and open source solution that
can be used by both academics and industry professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Shivkumar V. Iyer Bio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Power Electronics Engineer at a start-up in Kingston, ON that
develops solar microinverters. As a power electronics engineer my
primary interest is in simulating large electrical systems with multiple
power electronic converters. For this purpose, I am developing my own
free and open source circuit simulator called Python Power Electronics
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pythonpowerelectronics.com/"&gt;http://www.pythonpowerelectronics.com/&lt;/a&gt;). This circuit simulator has
been developed purely in Python and began with a blog
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pythonpowerelectronics.blogspot.ca/"&gt;http://pythonpowerelectronics.blogspot.ca/&lt;/a&gt;) and a project hosting on
SourceForge (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pythonpowerelec/"&gt;https://sourceforge.net/projects/pythonpowerelec/&lt;/a&gt;). The
website (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pythonpowerelectronics.com/"&gt;http://www.pythonpowerelectronics.com/&lt;/a&gt;) now contains all parts
of the project including case studies and examples and also
documentation on how to use the software. My primary interest lies in
simulating power systems with renewable energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
