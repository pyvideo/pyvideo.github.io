&lt;p&gt;Presented by Grig Gheorghiu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roy Fielding described REST in his Ph.D. dissertation in the year 2000.
Almost ten years later, Web developers are still confused as to how to
apply the REST principles in their applications. Examples of poorly
designed 'REST' APIs abound, and I will make use of them in my talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I will give an overview of REST and its design
principles, and I will show a concrete example of a RESTful Web service
implemented in the restish framework. My examples will include CRUD
operations, as well as transactions. I will also show how to consume
this Web service using both httplib2 and curl. I would be remiss if I
didn't describe ways to test the Web service with WebTest and twill.&lt;/p&gt;
