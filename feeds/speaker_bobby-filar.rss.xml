&lt;p&gt;Chatbots have become wildly popular interfaces for online services we use everyday. While these bots are not going to pass the Turing Test, they provide a platform to use natural language to perform a task. This talk covers the basics of chatbot development using Python NLP and Deep Learning libraries and provides a demonstration of Malbot, a simple bot that can converse about a piece of malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chatbots are programs that employ rules or artificial intelligence that users interact with via a dialogue interface. Chatbots are extremely useful tools for accomplishing a range of tasks. From ordering pizza to checking the weather to buying shoes, there's a chatbot for that. This bot revolution has led to the creation of several Make-A-Bot services (all with really cool .ai domains!), but these bots are not extremely powerful examples of artificial intelligence. Most are simple template-based implementations that can be developed independently in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide an overview on the structure of chatbots and how tools such as SpaCy, NLTK, sklearn, and Keras can be used to develop bots ranging from a basic weather bot to a more sophisticated deep learning neural conversation model. The applicability of these tools will be demonstrated through MalBot, a chatbot capable of ingesting a piece of malware and responding to natural language inquiries into the malicious softwareâ€™s capabilities. (e.g. &amp;quot;Do you record key strokes?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;What malware family are you from?&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
