In this talk, I'll walk you through some ways to lay out your individual facets according to the underlying data. For example, maybe each facet represents a city or point on a 2D plane - we'll explore ways to organize facets in a grid that mimics the data itself - unlocking your ability to explore patterns in 4+ dimensions. Other solutions to this problem rely on manually-curated lists that map common layouts to a grid, but in this talk, we'll explore solutions that work on EVERYTHING. I'll show you how to incorporate this technique into your viz and how I built the libraries since there are some interesting data science concepts at play.&lt;/p&gt;
