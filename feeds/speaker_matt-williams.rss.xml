&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cern.ch/ganga"&gt;Ganga&lt;/a&gt; is a tool, designed and used by the
large particle physics experiments at CERN. Written in pure Python, it
delivers a clean, usable interface to allow thousands of physicists to
interact with the huge computing resources available to them. It
provides a single platform with which data analysis tasks can be run on
anything from a local machine to being distributed seamlessly to
computing centres around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover the problems faced by physicists when dealing with
the computer infrastructure and how Ganga helps to solve this problem.
It will focus on how Python has helped create such a tool through its
advanced features such as metaclasses and integration into IPython.&lt;/p&gt;
