geospatial data using Spark, Impala, and Python. We use this framework
to join billions of device locations daily from mobile phone users to
millions of points of interest. We discuss our project structure and
workflow. Our work has broader application to movement of populations
through time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large-scale geospatial data is a common analytical challenge. We
receive billions of location data points per day for user locations.
We need to filter this data and map it to millions of points of
interest. Our end use case is to provide clients with information as
to the attributes of users who visit their stores. This workflow,
however, has application to the broader analytical problem of mapping
geospatially located entities of interest to points of interest with
known locations. We also provide our approach to the frequently
encountered issue of needing both standardized and flexible reporting.
We have automated the standard analyses in our workflow, but created
an API for analysts to quickly develop ad-hoc analyses based on
customer requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are freely available tools to the Python user that can help us
complete all of the tasks in our data analysis pipeline. At a high
level, the architecture of our process is as follows: HDFS storage for
large-scale geospatial data, Spark for geospatial joins, Cloudera
Impala accessed via Ibis to query resultant datasets, and scientific
python for conducting analyses. We make the automated analyses to the
end users via a web portal created using Flask and Celery. We created
an API available to analysts as a Python package so that they can
quickly perform custom analyses created by clients. We used Sphinx to
aid in documentation for easier use of the API.&lt;/p&gt;
