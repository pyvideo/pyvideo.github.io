outs of how best to work in it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a lot of people the technology field has always been a semi-magical
place where engineers use their arcane knowledge to tease the secrets
from the computer and unfortunately we have bought into this myth... Let
us examine what are some of the myths surrounding out field and which
aspects might actually be useful. Is SW engineering an art or just
another skill? Is talent required? Does it even matter? What about the
10X engineer...?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be sharing some insights that I have learned from trying to
answer these questions for myself, part based on research, part on
personal opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

possibilities for further enhancing your search by tracking user
searches or providing stored search functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

and in this talk I would like to present how it actually works. We will build
out a model of a search engine and analyze the result - what sort of functionality
and characteristics will the resulting engine have? What features can we implement
on top of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the talk will be generic but there will be some concrete examples from
Elasticsearch. At the end of the talk there will be time for questions regarding
anything search related.&lt;/p&gt;

Prelegent/Speaker: Honza Král&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today's world we have countless number of data stores, some are similiar and some very unique. I would like to share with you my journey into the world of databases - how I got started, what choices I am happy with and why and why did I make so many mistakes, what those were and how you can hopefully avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

Prelegent/Speaker: Honza Král&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will walk through Elasticsearch features targeted towards data exploration and analysis and show how you can use them to gain insight into your data and your users' behavior and how Elasticsearch allows you to build powerful real-time dashboards for your users. We will use real-life, publicly available data sets and open source tools. Every attendee should walk away with a clear understanding on what Elasticsearch can do with their data, what tools are available out of the box and how to extend them or creating custom ones.&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2015]

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elasticsearch has many use cases, some of them fairly obvious and
widely used, like plain searching through documents or analytics. In
this talk I would like to go through some of the more advanced
scenarios we have seen in the wild. Some examples of what we will
cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trend detection - how you can use the aggregation framework to go
beyond simple &amp;quot;counting&amp;quot; and make use of the full-text properties of
Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Percolator - percolator is reversed search and many people use it as
such to drive alerts or &amp;quot;stored search&amp;quot; functionality for their
website, let's look at how we can use it to detect languages, geo
locations or drive live search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we end up with some time to spare we can explore some other ideas
about how we can utilize the features of a search engine to drive non-
trivial data analysis including Geo-enabled search with relevancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times these logs are thrown away or just sit uselessly somewhere
on disk. I would like to show you how you can make sense of all that
data, how to collect and clean them, store them in a scalable fashion
and, finally, explore and search across various systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centralized logging (and the ELK stack) is proving itself to be a very
useful tool in managing a production infrastructure. When combined
with other data sources (application logging, business data, ...) it
can provide even more insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is an introduction into the area with some overview of the
motivation, tools and techniques that can prove useful. We will show
how the open source ELK (Elasticsearch Logstash and Kibana) stack can
be used to implement this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is geared towards people familiar with the DevOps concept that are
looking to improve their lives by introducing smarter tools.&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2016]
[19 July 2016]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/designing-a-pythonic-interface"&gt;https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/designing-a-pythonic-interface&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When designing an abstraction for a complex system (an ORM-like
library in our case) you face a lot of design decisions and
challenges. This talk details how we chose to tackle those when
designing elasticsearch-dsl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The json query language for elasticsearch, as well as its other APIs,
can be very daunting to new users and can be a bit cumbersome when
working with python. That is why we created elasticsearch-dsl - a sort
of ORM for elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will go through the design philosophy and obstacles found during
the development - trying to make a more pythonic interface for
elasticsearch while maintaining access to all of the features of the
underlying query language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of the talk is more on the library and interface design than
on elasticsearch and its query language itself, that is used only to
demonstrate the principles.&lt;/p&gt;

Elasticsearch can help you make sense of your data. We will start with
the most basic use case of searching your unstructured data and move on
to more advanced topics such as faceting, aggregations and structured
search. I would like to demonstrate that the very same tool and dataset
can be used for real-time analytics as well as the basis for your more
advanced data processing jobs. All in a distributed environment capable
of handling terabyte-sized datasets. All examples will be shown with
real data and python code demoing the new libraries we have been working
on to make this process easier.&lt;/p&gt;

and trying to minimize context-switching pains when using multiple
languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year we decided to create official clients for the most popular
languages, Python included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the goals were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support the complete API of elasticsearch including all parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide a 1-to-1 mapping to the rest API to avoid having opinions and
provide a familiar interface to our users consistent across languages
and evironments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;degrade gracefully when the es cluster is changing (nodes dropping
out or being added)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flexibility - allow users to customize and extend the clients easily
to suit their, potentially unique, environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I would like to take you through the process of designing
said client, the challenges we faced and the solutions we picked.
Amongst other things I will touch on the difference between languages
(and their respective communities), the architecture of the client
itself, mapping out the API and making sure it stays up to date and
integrating with existing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to show you how you can make sense of all that data, how to
collect and clean them, store them in a scalable fashion and, finally,

&lt;p&gt;Once we have all the data in one place I will go over some examples of
more advanced analysis (beyond simple, though very useful, counting of
things) like finding patterns and trends in your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (aka the ELK stack) to
achieve that. All tools presented are open source and examples will be
using real life use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with what is a search engine and how it works we will introduce
the tools and techniques to help you design a search functionality that
will make your users happy.&lt;/p&gt;
