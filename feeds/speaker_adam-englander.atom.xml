Micro-Services, we are all building more APIs than ever before. Like
many other developers, I had struggled with finding the right mix of
security and simplicity for securing APIs. Some standards from the IETF
have made it possible to accomplish both. Let me show you how to utilize
existing libraries to lock down you API without writing a ton of code.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to write a secure API with future
proof security utilizing JOSE. JOSE is a collection of complimentary
standards: JWT, JWE, JWS, JWA, and JWK. JOSE is used by OAuth, OpenID,
and others to secure communications between APIs and consumers. Now you
can use it to secure your API.&lt;/p&gt;
