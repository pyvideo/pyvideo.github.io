The web applications are vulnerable for various reasons including a) configuration settings of the web applications b) lack of implementation of security best practices and secure coding and c) lack of awareness of secure first web applications among developers. The vulnerable web applications put the data of the customers at greater risk and the compromised code can lead to problems beyond control. It is very important to develop secure web applications to protect customer data and code to mitigate the risk. In this talk, we will focus on two aspects. First, performing penetration testing on Django web applications to identify vulnerabilities and scanning for Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 risks. Second, strategies and configuration settings for making the source code and Django applications secure. We will also discuss the Djangohunter tool to identify incorrectly configured Django applications that are exposing sensitive information.

Django being one of the most popular Python-based web frameworks, applications developed using Django are always on the radar of hackers who try to find the vulnerabilities in the Django application and exploit the same for their benefit. Many times security is ignored or not well done due to a lack of awareness and the cost associated with it. But Security is too costly to be ignored. Although Django has many built-in security features, they are not sufficient to safeguard the application.  The talk begins with highlighting the importance of security and identifying security issues in Django applications using the Mozilla Observatory tool, then using the recommendations of the tool to secure them. Next, I will compare and contrast Mozilla's Web Security recommendations and Open Web Application Security Project(OWASP) Top 10 recommendations. Next, I will discuss built-in security features in Django. Finally, I will discuss the configuration settings and issues that may affect the secure deployment of Django applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are passing through an unknown street at midnight and you find that some anti-social elements are following you. To save yourself from them you start running and look for a safe place to hide. On the way, you will find a good person and requests him to help you. He hides you in his place to protect you. When these anti-social elements visit a good person’s place and enquire about you, the good person misguides them and redirects them to some other place in order to protect you. This is exactly how deception works. In this analogy, YOU are the resources to be protected, anti-social elements are the hackers who want to gain access to the resources, and a good person is a deception technique that protects the resources from hackers by making them fall in the trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk begins with an introduction to deception technology, deception types, and methods, a deceptive security life cycle. In this talk, we will demonstrate the following deception tools implemented using python language:
•       WebTrap (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/IllusiveNetworks-Labs/WebTrap"&gt;https://github.com/IllusiveNetworks-Labs/WebTrap&lt;/a&gt;): is designed to create deceptive webpages to deceive and redirect attackers away from real websites. The deceptive webpages are generated by cloning real websites, specifically their login pages.
•       DemonHunter (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/RevengeComing/DemonHunter"&gt;https://github.com/RevengeComing/DemonHunter&lt;/a&gt;):  is a distributed low interaction honeypot with Agent/Master design
Finally, we will conclude the talk with how built a deception tool and demonstrate its working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we implemented a deception tool in python using machine learning:
We designed a deception tool in python language using PyBRAIN package to model and mitigate XPath injection attacks for web services. It is known that XML can be used to store the data and this data can be queried using XPath query language. XPath is a query language, it has injection issues similar to SQL. To handle this issue, we proposed a solution, which uses a count-based validation technique and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modular neural networks to identify and classify atypical behavior in user input. Once the atypical user input is identified, the attacker is redirected to fake resources to protect the critical data. Our experiment resulted in over 90% accuracy in the classification of input vectors.&lt;/p&gt;

However, this popularity also puts in the target range of attackers. The attackers perform malicious dependency attacks and use misconfiguration tools to reveal confidential information. Jukka Ruohonen, Kalle Hjerppe, and Kalle Rindell in their research paper “A Large-Scale Security-Oriented Static Analysis of Python Packages in PyPI” claimed that they scanned PyPI for security issues in Python packages and found the presence of at least one security issue in about 46% of the Python packages. In addition, security vulnerabilities can be present in the source code of the package. In this talk, we will address the security issues related to python packaging and possible solutions to make python packages secure.&lt;/p&gt;

The session discusses techniques to reduce computational complexity. This session also discusses a case study on how machine learning techniques can be applied to encrypted data for secure computation and protecting the machine learning model. The talk will include the demonstration of the Python implementation of the RSA algorithm. To demonstrate the techniques to reduce complexity, we will perform multiplication over large random numbers using common * operator, multiplication using FFT, and Karatsuba algorithm. SciPy package has an in-built implementation for FFT. To demonstrate the implementation of secure machine learning model we used PyBRAIN and cryptography packages of python.&lt;/p&gt;

The talk begins with an introduction to digital forensics, the process of investigation, and the collection of evidence. Next, I will cover the various python modules and built-in functions required to build your first cyber forensic application. The modules covered in the discussion are pyscreenshot, Whoosh, PIL, hashlib, mutagen, pyPDF2, and pefile. Finally, I will demonstrate creating small cyber forensic applications using bulit-in modules and functions that are already to known to most of the Python programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

the human race on earth. Math is everywhere and around us. It is in
nature, music, sports, economics, engineering, and so on. In our daily
life, we use mathematics knowingly and unknowingly. Many of us are
unaware that forensic experts use mathematics to solve crime mysteries.
In this talk, we will explore how Sherlock Holmes, the famous fictional
detective character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle uses Mathematics
and Python programming language to solve crime mysteries. We will solve
simple crime puzzles using mathematics and python scripts. Finally, we
will solve a few complex hypothetical crime mysteries using advanced
python concepts. The participants will learn how to use the concepts of
mathematics such as statistics, probability, trigonometry, and graph
theory, and python and its packages such as SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib
to solve the crime puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;

applications. The web applications are vulnerable for various reasons
including a) configuration settings of the web applications b) lack of
implementation of security best practices and secure coding and c) lack of
awareness of secure first web applications among developers. The vulnerable
web applications put the data of the customers at greater risk and the
compromised code can lead to problems beyond control. It is very important
to develop secure web applications to protect customer data and code to
mitigate the risk. In this talk, we will focus on two aspects. First,
performing penetration testing on Django web applications to identify
vulnerabilities and scanning for Open Web Application Security Project
(OWASP) Top 10 risks. Second, strategies and configuration settings for
making the source code and Django applications secure. We will also discuss
the Djangohunter tool to identify incorrectly configured Django applications
that are exposing sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;

to gadgets such as smartphones even before they go to school. This makes
them technology savvy and at the same time they get bored easily in
traditional classroom settings. It becomes necessary to use modern tools
and techniques in the classroom to engage students in activities. Also
governments are promoting “Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)” concept in
education which can be a boon to those who cannot afford a computer or
laptop. In this lightning talk I will introduce the QPython which can be
installed on smartphone to execute Python programs.&lt;/p&gt;
