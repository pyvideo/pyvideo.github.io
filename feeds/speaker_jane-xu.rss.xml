Who hasn't! Hop on the bus with us and feel the road become smoother as we talk about stacking together techniques like FSDP2 + QLoRa + CPU Offloading + Fused ADAM (thanks Intel) + more in PyTorch native. We will give an overview of these techniques as well as the hard edges we solved in their composition. Curious for more? Or...still OOMing? We also plan on discussing our more researchy work on offloading, pagedness, and low precision optimizers.&lt;/p&gt;
