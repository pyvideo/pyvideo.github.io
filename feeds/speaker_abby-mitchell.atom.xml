First released in 2017, Qiskit has become the most popular package for quantum computing (Unitary Fund, 2022), with a thriving open-source community. As Qiskit has grown and changed, so has our approach to nurturing our community. This talk will share important lessons we’ve learnt over the years, including practical tips you can apply to your own projects. Whether you’re just starting in open-source or already manage an established community, this talk is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
