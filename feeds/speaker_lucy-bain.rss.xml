We interact with people every day, let's do it a bit better! First I'll cover a bit about improving how you connect with people day to day. Then we'll move into participating in your communities and how to make it a better experience. Finally, I'll discuss some ways to organise events that work for you, so you get the most out of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
