educational psychology, and community development. I save you $50k in
tuition and hundreds of hours of reading and give you the short version
for Pythonistas who care about education and outreach. You'll learn how
to critically analyze and describe your Python learning/teaching methods
and progress to other hackers and/or educators. This is a revised and
expanded version of a talk given at the last PyCon in Santa Clara, with
insights from the current batch at Hacker School.&lt;/p&gt;

How can we visualize how
deafness affects a child's speech? These are signal processing
questions, traditionally tackled only by upper-level engineering
students with MATLAB and differential equations; we're going to do it
with algebra and basic Python skills. Based on a signal processing class
for audiology graduate students, taught by a deaf musician.&lt;/p&gt;
