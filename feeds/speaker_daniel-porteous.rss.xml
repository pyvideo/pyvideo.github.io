But what can we do with that data, and is it enough? In this talk we'll look at how to process import time data, structure it, visualise it, and make concrete choices to improve start up time. Python need not be slow to start!&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, you can even write your own! Context managers are an amazing tool for managing resources safely.
