Multi-node CPU and single-node GPU workloads with Spark, Dask and RAPIDS.</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pydata-new-york-city-2019/is-spark-still-relevant-multi-node-cpu-and-single-node-gpu-workloads-with-spark-dask-and-rapids.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compare Dask, Spark, and RAPIDS in a typical business workload: dataset exploration, model building, prediction and dashboarding / reporting. Of specific interest are infrastructure, ease of use and some general musings on the practicality of these compute frameworks. This talk will specifically address the relevance of these systems to the unique brand of problems we face in modern businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
