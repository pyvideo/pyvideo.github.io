Sentry is another story of that simple idea, but one that has continued
over the better part of a decade. We'll talk about how Sentry was
started as an unambitious side project and grew into the open source,
venture-backed business it is today. Additionally we'll cover what it's
taken to build a company as an extremely technical software engineer,
including lessons learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically it will focus on things you should avoid early on, and where you can get easy wins. Additionally I'll cover various high level components of an early scaling strategy such as database sharding, CDN caching, and overall architecture to simplify the growing pains.
- How to approach sharding (architecture)
- Horizontal vs vertical, which solution is right and when
- How we sharded the Django ORM
- Materialized views using Redis
- Buffered counters using Redis&lt;/p&gt;

We'll dive into how DISQUS adopted testing, and the many challenges
we've had to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing can be one of the more difficult concepts to pick up in a
development cycle. With the complexities of large projects, and even
small projects, writing effective, automated tests can take many times
longer than writing the code and testing it by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore the various patterns of testing that DISQUS has
implemented, and iterated upon over the last two years. It will describe
how testing has been used to speed up the product lifecycle, improve
stability through automation, and the culture shift required to get
there. Most importantly, it will cover the practices that have been put
in place that have helped ease the burden of writing tests.&lt;/p&gt;

and more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous deployment (and testing) has started to become a reality for
many companies. It brings to light one of the many problems that face
large product teams, but also creates some of its own. This talk will
focus on the pros and cons of continuous deployment, how DISQUS switched
from the recurring release cycle to continuous releases, as well as
providing tips and arguments for adopting it in your workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building scalable web applications may seem like a distant problem, but
the problem is not thinking about it before it's too late. This talk
will focus on designing a scalable web application before it needs to be
(and avoiding the premature optimization dilemma). It will cover topics
such as efficient usage of your database, appropriate caching (and
invalidation!), and what the speaker considers as best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disqus, one of the largest Python applications on the web, will explain
how they deal with scaling complexities in a growing startup. Founded in
2007, Disqus maintains a small engineering team reaching over 400
million users a month. Being powered by Python has allowed quick
iteration of the application, without sacrificing code quality and
performance. The talk will cover key parts of the architecture and
development process at Disqus, including hardware, databases, and common
bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
