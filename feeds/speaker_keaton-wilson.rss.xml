The main goals were to foster collaboration, improve our legacy codebase, and deliver high-quality data products. Key topics covered include teamwide adoption of version control and GitHub, building and deploying internal R packages, Quarto-based documentation, and strategies for gaining buy-in across teams and leadership. Attendees can expect practical insights and tools for instigating change in their own organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
