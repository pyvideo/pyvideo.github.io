&lt;p&gt;At the end of this session, beginners and persons on the intermediate level will have enough knowledge of how they can build a career in open source; experts will also get more insights on how they can contribute to the advancement of open source contribution by giving back to the community as a mentor helping new contributors understand the open source ecosystem and contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
