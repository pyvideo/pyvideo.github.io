Presenting few tricks which Python beginners usually don't know and can save a while both on development and on production.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

What is common
denominator between different plays and game ending? In this
presentation, we will show how Machine Learning and Hadoop can help us
re-discover chess rules and gain new understanding of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can empirical samples unveil the big picture? Is chess games
descriptions expose good enough data to gain understanding of chess
rules - legal piece moves, castling, check versus checkmate, etc. Which
features are important in describing a chess game and which features are
not. What is a good representation of a chess game for this uses. What
is the minimal sample size which is required in order to learn this in a
good enough manner and where this learning can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ne3 =&amp;gt; E=mc2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the bigger picture - Can we understand big systems based on
empirical samples. Can we reverse engineer physics and discover how
physical system work based on no external knowledge beside empirical
samples.&lt;/p&gt;
