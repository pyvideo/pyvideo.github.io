Blockchain technology?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology is one of the fastest moving part in the
Fintech area. However, the Blockchain is not only the basis of crypto
currencies. First of all it’s a decentralized registry that cannot be
modified. This means that using a Blockchain, users can trust in the
validity of a dataset without the need to establish a central
authority. Thus, the Blockchain can be used to store records e.g. of
land ownership or and other property rights in countries with weak or
corrupt or otherwise incompetent authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Python programmers with an understanding of this
technology are especially well prepared to contribute in this area,
because the agility inherent to Python makes it easy to program in a
fast moving environment. The fact that various applications in the
Bitcoin and Blockchain area are implemented in Python prove this
notion. However, the reverse is also true: An understanding of the
distributed ledger technology possibly enables you to solve problems
in projects you encounter in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will present the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Blockchain architecture: nodes, transactions, headers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bitcoin protocol and its proof of work (POW)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin alternatives: Proof-of-work (PoW) compared to Proof-of-stake (PoS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the implications for the society if people enjoy their work,
because this work is perceived as rewarding by itself? It is this
question that occupies me since I have finished my Ph.D. research about
the motivation of open source programmers. In my research, I have been
able to show that fun is an important driver for open source
programmers. Moreover, fun plays an important role not only for
hobbyists, but for developers who are paid for their work too (open or
closed source).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings contrast with the traditional efforts of leftist parties
and labor unions. For those political organizations, labor is perceived
as compulsion and exploitation and, therefore, people have to be
liberated from labor. The resulting political praxis is to send people
into retirement as soon as possible and, on the other hand, to make the
life for unemployed people carefree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the software developers‘ world a little Shangri-La, apart from the
real world, delineated by the leftist parties, or is the open source
model generalizable? What happens with the values generated through the
labor if the work as such is rewarding? The open source mode of
production is part of our modern reality and in my presentation I would
like to consider this big reality from the perspective of open source.&lt;/p&gt;
