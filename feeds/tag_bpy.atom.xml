a new BPY python API which is usable for scripting modeling, animation,
etc. Learn to use this API to speed up your workflow, create procedural
graphics, and cool new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2.5, the API has become more pythonic and self-descriptive.
Blender's UI can show you the Python equivalent for nearly every user
action and includes a full datablock exploration tool. Users will be
taught how to use so they can quickly adapt to their appropriate needs
with a little Blender experience and no previous BPY experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a brief Blender overview, an introduction to the API and
how to use it, as well as / along with an overview of some of the
presenter's own tools / use cases. Some other popular 3rd party Python
tools will also be shown as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is time, a brief demo of the Blender Game Engine will also be
given, though that is a separate API.&lt;/p&gt;
