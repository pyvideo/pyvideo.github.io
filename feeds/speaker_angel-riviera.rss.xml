CI/CD enables teams to establish processes that increase velocity, collaboration and quality of their codebase. CI/CD enables developer &amp;amp; operations teams to break down unnecessary silos and gain a deeper knowledge of their respective arenas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this workshop the participants will be introduced to the basic fundamentals of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. Participants will learn the core principles of CI/CD and have the opportunity to reinforce what theyâ€™ve learned in a hands on workshop featuring the CircleCI platform. The workshop will demonstrate CI/CD build configuration, code commits, commit builds, code testing and packaging. The participants will leave with a hands-on experience and understanding of what it takes to CI/CD.&lt;/p&gt;
