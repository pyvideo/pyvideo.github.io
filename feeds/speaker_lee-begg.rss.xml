Service (PaaS) for hosting Django apps, and you can run it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Nginx, Circus, Chaussette, and Django, with some support from
Django-environ and deployment automation using Fabric. All of that
except Nginx are written in Python. Systemd is a new init process
coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circus is a process and socket manager, and gives a nice way to scale
processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chaussette WSGI server works well with Circus, as Circus can pass the
socket to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django-environ it's a library that parses environment variables or
files with key-value pairs. Environment variables are used on some
PaaS, but the file support I find very useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fabric is a framework for writing system commands to be run on remote
hosts, and is great for automating system administration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systemd is a new &amp;quot;init&amp;quot; process for Linux and offers some interesting
possibilities for hosting Python webapps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
