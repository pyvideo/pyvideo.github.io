models to well-groomed datasets. Everyone working on industrial problems
will eventually learn, that this does not reflect reality. The amount of
time spent on modeling is small compared to data gathering, -warehousing
and -cleaning. Even after training and deployment of the model, the work
is not done. Continuous monitoring of the performance and input data is
still necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I discuss how important data handling is for successful
data science projects. Each milestone, from finding the business case to
continuously monitoring the performance of the solution, is addressed.
This is exemplary shown on a project, with the goal of improving a
productive system.&lt;/p&gt;
