putting it beyond the reach of the average web developer. However,
addition of just a few lines of code to a django project using the
django-secure package can pre-emptively pick much of an attackers
low-hanging fruit. In this meetup, we will secure a simple website using
django-secure, use the command-line tool &amp;quot;checksecure&amp;quot; to do a security
audit, and discuss a few of the attacks django-secure protects against.
In the process, we will learn how to use nginx for more robust security
and discuss how to pass a security audit.&lt;/p&gt;
