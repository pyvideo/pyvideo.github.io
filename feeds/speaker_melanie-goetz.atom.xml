&lt;p&gt;Productionizing data science often involves a team of scientists prototyping a statistical model in a language like R followed by a team of engineers translating and rebuilding that model into a “production&amp;quot; language. However, with Python, it’s easy to have your Data Science team and your Engineering teams working together collaboratively in the same language. But how does a modular production data science pipeline in Python look? This talk will cover how the data science pipeline at Clover automatically turns messy health data into insights and decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
