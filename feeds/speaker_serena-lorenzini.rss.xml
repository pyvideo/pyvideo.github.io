infrastructure. It is easy to learn but rushing to use it with a limited
knowledge of its best practices leads to not reusable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating reusable Ansible roles is a strongly encouraged practice, in
fact there is a tool designed just for this purpose: Ansible Galaxy. It
comes bundled with Ansible and its purpose is to download roles from the
Galaxy hub and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk wants to show how we manage our Ansible roles and their
dependencies in a consistent way by means of Ansible Galaxy. It will
also offer an overview of how Ansible roles can be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
