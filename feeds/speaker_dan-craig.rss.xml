couple of decades has been focused on web services, but there are lots
of different types of software systems that have different testing
needs. This talk will first explore the differences and similarities
between testing web services and testing safety- and mission-critical
software systems, such as those used on spacecraft. We will then
consider a rubric for thinking about the verification needs of different
types of software based on attributes of the software and the
environments in which it runs. Finally, we will examine a real-world
example of using pytest to test Varda Space Industries' spacecraft
software, showcasing many of pytest's power features, such as its
fixtures and extensive hook system, as well as Python language features
such as generators, context managers, and threading, that enable
easy-to-use tools for testing against real-time telemetry streams and
generating rich test report output.&lt;/p&gt;
