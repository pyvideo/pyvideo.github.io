&lt;p&gt;Python as a language for DeepLearning. Python is emerging as the facto language to specify Deep Learning Networks. In this talk we will explore some of the popular libraries like Tensorflow and Keras to see the semantics used to describe such networks and look a bit more under the hood at what is the python layer actually doing for these well known deep learning libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
