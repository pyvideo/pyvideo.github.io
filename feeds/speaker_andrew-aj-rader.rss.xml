Some typical areas of application for NLP involve text classification, speech recognition, machine translation, chatbots, and caption generation. Fundamentally, NLP involves converting words into numbers and doing math on these numbers in order to identify relationships between the words and documents they live in. The goal of this talk is to present the basic theory of what NLP is and demonstrate how to utilize machine learning approaches in Python to extract insights from text. An example text classification problem is presented; illustrating the steps required to ingest, preprocess, build and test a model for an example text corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
