In this talk I will introduce SimuPy, a framework for simulating interconnected dynamical system models. SimuPy provides an open source, Python-based tool that can be used in model- and system- based design and simulation workflows. I will demonstrate how to use SimuPy to simulate canonical dynamical systems and how I have used it perform numerical studies of nonlinear tracking control in my thesis and doctoral research.&lt;/p&gt;
