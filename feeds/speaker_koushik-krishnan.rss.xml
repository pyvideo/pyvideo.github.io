They are a great tool for both Python
beginners and experienced professionals alike. A problem arises when we
have to &amp;quot;productionize&amp;quot; our Jupyter notebook code into a web service.
What if we didn't have to rewrite our code to do this? That's where

&lt;p&gt;Speaker: Koushik Krishnan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Koushik and I am an engineer at Microsoft. I work on distributed database systems and believe it or not, I use a lot of Python to build tools to so. I believe Python can help us make complicated software systems easier to operate and more performant as a result. When I am not coding I like to play disc golf and try speed-running my favorite video games.&lt;/p&gt;
