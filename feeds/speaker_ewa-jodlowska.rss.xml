As the Python ecosystem has grown, so have the volunteer efforts. However, some jobs are of a scale where they can’t reasonably be asked of a volunteer. The PSF also has an important role in financially supporting the Python community. In this keynote, we’ll see how the Python community is growing, what new challenges that brings, and how we can sustainably address them, so that the PSF can continue its mission to grow and nurture our community.&lt;/p&gt;
