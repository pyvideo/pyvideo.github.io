But underlying it all are a number of open source tools, notably R and Python. How can we contribute to sustaining these open source projects, so that we can continue to use and build on them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will address this question in the context of the R project. I will give an overview of the ways we can contribute as individuals or companies/organizations, both financially and in kind. Together we can build a more sustainable future for R!&lt;/p&gt;
