Serpent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blockchain technology is an ingenious invention that has gained a
lot of momentum and public attention in the recent years. In this talk
we are going to quickly review the basic concepts behind this
technology, starting from its very first implementation: The Bitcoin
Blockchain. We will look into the core technology components the base of
Bitcoin, which are its strengths and limitations. We will then discuss
how the Ethereum project tries to overcome these limitations introducing
the Turing complete Ethereum Virtual Machine and advanced Smart
Contracts, giving developers the power to build any kind of applications
on top of the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this small theoretical introduction, we will explore what are the
Python tools that you need to use to interact with the Ethereum
blockchain and develop Smart Contracts. Many of the tools to interact
and develop with the Ethereum blockchain are built with Python. We will
learn which are the basic tools used to run a blockchain locally on our
laptops going through the installation and preparation process to get a
full Ethereum node up and running on our local machine. Serpent is one
of the languages of choice when building Smart Contracts in Ethereum and
it is heavily inspired by Python. We will learn how to write a simple
Smart Contract, test it and deploy it to our local running blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this talk it is required just basic Python knowledge. Some basic
theoretic blockchain foundations are preferred to get a clear
understanding of the second part of the talk, but not strictly
necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
