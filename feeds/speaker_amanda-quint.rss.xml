experience, it’s often been the most important metric to management —
often at the expense of missing out on the rest of the story. In this
talk, we'll explore Earned Business Value, Lead Time, and Cumulative
Flow to examine how these metrics might deliver additional insight into
teams' development lifecycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to learn more about software metrics, I recommend these
two books:&lt;/p&gt;
