to create complex and feature rich topological maps. Watch as each extra
layer introduces more interesting, diverse worlds which can be used as
images, in games, or as a playground for the curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Michael McHugh Bio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduced to Python a decade ago, I now work as a lead engineer at
Urban Airship. Originally from Southern Ontario, I moved to Portland,
Oregon 4 years ago. I use half a dozen languages on a weekly basis, but
Python has always been my go to for experimentation and productivity.
Owner of untold hundreds of half finished projects, seeing how far I can
push an idea is much more exciting to me than seeing something
completed.&lt;/p&gt;
