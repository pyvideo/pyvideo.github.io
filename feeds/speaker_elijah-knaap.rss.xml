sciences broadly concerned with the influence of spatial context on
social processes. From the study of segregation dynamics, the
relationships between the built environment and health outcomes, to the
impact of concentrated poverty on social efficacy, neighborhoods are a
central construct in empirical work. From a dynamic lens, neighborhoods
experience changes not only in their socioeconomic composition, but also
in spatial extent; this latter source of change, however, has been
largely neglected in the extant literature. In this paper, we discuss
the development of novel, spatially explicit approaches to the study of
longitudinal neighborhood dynamics using the scientific Python
ecosystem.Presenter(s): Speaker: Serge Rey, University of California,
