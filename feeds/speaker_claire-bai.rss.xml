Over time, we have received many of the same questions from our data users, which indicated a dire need for translating our internal clinical guidance and data model knowledge into a tool for successfully navigating our data. We developed rwnavigator, an R package that helps users easily prepare COTA data for analysis with time-to-event packages. As first-time package developers, we ran into many challenges as we created, tested, and deployed rwnavigator. We hope to share with the greater R community our motivations for developing this package and best practices we learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
