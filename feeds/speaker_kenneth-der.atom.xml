The highly-cited CHIANTI project, now in its 20th year, is an invaluable resource to the solar physics community. The ChiantiPy project brings the power of the scientific Python stack to the CHIANTI database, allowing solar physicists and astronomers to easily make use of this atomic data and calculate commonly used quantities from it such as radiative loss rates and emissivities for particular atomic transitions. In this talk, we will briefly discuss the history of the CHIANTI database and the ChiantiPy project as well as the current state of the project and its place in the solar physics community. We will demonstrate some of the capabilities of the ChiantiPy code and show examples of how ChiantiPy can be used in both modeling and observational studies. Finally, we'll discuss how ChiantiPy helps to bring the power of the CHIANTIC atomic database to the growing set of astronomy-related tools in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
