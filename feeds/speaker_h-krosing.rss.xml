&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short overview how PostgreSQL can be used for tasks that are currently
often delegated to heterogeneous bunch of data storage solutions
referred to by common name NoSQL. Covered topics from traditional NoSQL
area are: developer friendlyness, even for sloppy developers scalability
easy extensibility and maintainability And from SQL part partial ACID
(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) , general BASE
(basically available, soft state, eventually consistent) business rule
checking in database, hard to overlook even in case of multiple
