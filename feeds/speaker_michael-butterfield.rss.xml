Project Panoptes. Our goal is to build low cost, reliable, robotic
telescopes which can be used to detect transiting exoplanets. Panoptes
is designed from the ground up to be a citizen science project which
will involve the public in all aspects of the science, from data
acquisition to data reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of Project Panoptes (Panoptic Astronomical Networked OPtical
observatory for Transiting Exoplanets Survey, see
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://projectpanoptes.org/"&gt;http://projectpanoptes.org/&lt;/a&gt;) is to build low cost, reliable, robotic
telescopes which can be used to detect transiting exoplanets. The
hardware is designed to be standardized, using as many commercial off
the shelf components as possible so that a Panoptes &amp;quot;unit&amp;quot; can be
reproduced quickly and easily by students or amateurs. In this way, many
units can be deployed at many different sites to provide continuous and
redundant sky coverage. Panoptes is designed from the ground up to be a
citizen science project which will involve the public in all aspects of
the science, from data acquisition to data reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we describe the current status of the Panoptes
Observatory Control System (POCS, see &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/panoptes/POCS"&gt;https://github.com/panoptes/POCS&lt;/a&gt;),
an open source, collaborative, python-based software package. POCS is
designed to be a simple as possible in order to make it accessible to
non-experts. As such, POCS is a state machine which transitions between
a few well defined operating states. We make extensive use of existing
modules (notably astropy and pyephem). The challenge we face in writing
POCS to to balance our desire for simplicity and accessibility against
capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also briefly describe the other software challenges of our
project, specifically an algorithm designed to extract accurate
photometry from DSLR images (color images obtained using a Bayer color
filter array) rather than from the more traditional filtered monochrome
CCD image.&lt;/p&gt;
