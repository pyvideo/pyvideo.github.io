We'll first go through the common tools and tricks which may surprise you on the performance improvement, and compare the two prevailing tools, Cython and Pybind11. Finally, their similarity and difference, in terms of implementation and performance, will be listed out so that attendees can thoroughly understand the criteria to choose the right library in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

We will go through the common tricks and tips to archive the best performance on the Python level. Then the two reputable libraries, Cython and Pybind11, will be visited to archive the compiled language performance and compared with their implementation, flexibility and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
