up. But how slow is any given thing youâ€™re doing? How much faster is
Cython? 100X of what? In this talk, we will write some python data
analysis code in Cython, read some parts of its generated code to
understand what all Python has to do to run it, and understand how long
different things take by running microbenchmarks. We will then see how
simple hints to Cython can help it generate faster code, and see how
fast it gets. This talk is intended for Python users writing performance
sensitive applications, who are at least mildly familiar with Cython
and/or C/C++. Attendees will learn how to profile and optimize common
operations, which should help them to evaluate Cython or Python for
their use-case.&lt;/p&gt;
