&lt;p&gt;When people are first learning Django, they do a lot of work to reach the point where they have a project that works locally. Then they think, &amp;quot;All right! Now I can deploy my project and everyone can see how wonderful it is!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What comes next? They have to identify a hosting service, hopefully find docs that are up to date enough to use, make a bunch of changes to their project, hope for no typos or misunderstandings, and maybe they'll end up with a deployed project. Many projects languish on local systems because of how difficult it can be to carry out your first deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written &lt;cite&gt;django-simple-deploy&lt;/cite&gt; as a standalone management command that inspects a local project, and automatically configures the project for deployment to the specified hosting platform. If a project is being tracked with Git and has a requirements file, and you have an account on a hosting platform with their CLI installed, you can deploy in a few steps without ever visiting the hosting platform's docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover:
- A live demo.
- Why the Django community needs a project like &lt;cite&gt;django-simple-deploy&lt;/cite&gt;.
- What does this mean for people who have just finished the Polls tutorial?
- What does this mean for hosting companies?
- How it works: What changes does &lt;cite&gt;django-simple-deploy&lt;/cite&gt; make to your project?
- How it works: How does &lt;cite&gt;django-simple-deploy&lt;/cite&gt; make these changes?
- Deep dive: How do you test a Django project that acts on another Django project, and targets a remote platform?
- Open questions (my open questions)
- Contributing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is not just for beginners. Beginners will benefit from knowing about a simple deployment tool, but intermediate developers will probably learn something from peeking under the hood of a management command that acts on another project. And people who teach Django will probably appreciate having a tool that configures a project for deployment, without having to talk their students through all the steps of deploying to a specific platform.&lt;/p&gt;

happening here for thousands of years. But shifting rainfall patterns
have increased the frequency of landslides, with catastrophic results.
In the last 8 years, three different towns in our region have
experienced fatal landslides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a major landslide in 2015, a number of local people with
experience in the outdoors and in various scientific fields noticed a
possible correlation between river levels and landslide activity. Our
main river has a small watershed, so it responds rapidly to periods of
heavy precipitation. Using Python, I was able to investigate the
question we all kept coming back to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is the correlation between changing river levels and landslide activity
strong enough to serve as the basis for predicting landslides?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using historical readings from a local river gage, a set of conditions
was identified that correlate meaningfully with landslide activity. In
about 12 events where the river met those conditions, at least 5 were
associated with known landslides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted a landslide-risk monitoring tool in 2021, which provides a
visual indication of when the river is behaving in a way that correlates
with previously known landslide events. This tool is used by many
community members to assess the ongoing risk of landslide activity
during heavy rain events. Just as importantly, it helps people let go of
anxiety when we're experiencing rain that feels heavy, but isn't
actually associated with landslide risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will show how Python's vast ecosystem supports the entire
citizen-scientist lifecycle, from idea to public-facing resource.&lt;/p&gt;
