In this fast-paced talk, you will learn how to create advanced regular expressions, as well as powerful and unconventional nuances to using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will introduce verbose expressions, lookahead assertions, greedy expressions, multi-line expressions, locale-aware expressions and more, with many code examples. I will introduce robust ways to use regular expressions, including named groups and returning matches as an Iterator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will briefly highlight multiple-expression design practices, testing, developer tooling, and even historical origins of the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginner-level regular expression familiarity is assumed. Please join me!&lt;/p&gt;
