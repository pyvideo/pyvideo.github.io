AI models are also becoming more common, and I’d like to showcase a portion of AI and its capabilities. While this isn’t related to Python as a whole, the growing technology proves to be of great use for many business problems, and closely relates to computer science. Towards the end of this demo, there will be an interactive Python hangman game for crowd fun if there is time, as well as Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
