the victories and how women are not being recognized as an important
part of the tech community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How and why I wanted to be an iOS mobile developer at the age of 51.
Some people want to believe that people my age are out of touch with
technology and as a woman, I have seen the best and the worst in the
tech community but I also now that there is a solution at the end of the
rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the boom in use of smartphones, we have seen a corresponding growth
in numbers of available apps, some of which are being leveraged for
social change. What people donâ€™t know is 70% of women are more active on
our mobile device than men, women are more active with social media,
shopping, photo apps, are more connected to entertainers and play more
games on their smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that being said we the tech community need to open up our arm and
embrace the change and think about how women in tech can change the way
we see and create apps.&lt;/p&gt;
