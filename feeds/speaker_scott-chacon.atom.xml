&lt;p&gt;Presented by Scott Chacon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fair amount of unnecessary animosity between developers about
version control systems, especially between Mercurial and Git users. In
reality, these two systems are very similar and can actually cooperate
pretty well. In this talk we will show just how similar Git and
Mercurial are, look at some of their technical differences, and see how
they can work together by looking at hg-git, the bidirectional
Git/Mercurial bridge, implemented in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
