In the other hand, anonymization of data has became lately a very sensitive field, retrieving information from the dataset that could compromise the privacy of a patient is dangerous and by generating artificial samples that would look like the original from patients we can avoid thisproblem 2) Image segmentation for magnetic resonance image: image to image translation are often used to generate neural style transfer in order to make a picture look more like a famous painting but in this case I would like to provide important information for a physician, that includes the location of tumors in the brain, gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. Valuable information to automate diagnostics and decision making when time is key element.&lt;/p&gt;
