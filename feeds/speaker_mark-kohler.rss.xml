embedded systems to be built with Linux and Python, instead of the
traditional approach of a real-time operating system and C. This talk
reviews the differences between those approaches and describes problems,
solutions, and tools that can be used when building embedded systems
with Python.&lt;/p&gt;

libraries from Python. The goal of this talk is to introduce both tools,
discuss their strengths, their weaknesses, and the situations that
clearly favor one tool over the other.&lt;/p&gt;
