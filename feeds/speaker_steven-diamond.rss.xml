Python. It allows the user to express convex optimization problems in a
natural syntax that follows the math, rather than in the restrictive
standard form required by solvers. CVXPY has been used in hundreds of
research projects and by Fortune 500 companies. In this talk, we will
show how easy it is to formulate and solve optimization problems with
CVXPY through example applications in finance and renewable energy. The
talk is intended for anyone with a basic Python and math background who
is interested in optimization or its applications.Presenter(s): Speaker:
