&lt;p&gt;Description
A talk about the flourishing intersection between machine learning and art, a survey of recent works emerging from it, and a primer on how to get started with it for seasoned developers and newcomers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Over the past several years, two trends in machine learning have converged to pique the curiosity of artists working with code: the proliferation of powerful open source deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Torch, and the emergence of data-intensive generative models for hallucinating images, sounds, and text as though they came from the oeuvre of Shakespeare, Picasso, or just a gigantic database of digitized cats. This talk will review these developments and offer a set of interdisciplinary tools and learning resources for artists and data scientists alike, if ever there was a difference to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
