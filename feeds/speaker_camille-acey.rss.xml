resulted in my being continually called on to help community groups and
fellow organizers understand and more correctly wield technology in
service of their mission. Using my blogpost &amp;quot;Three Tips for Providing
Tech Help to Non-Profits and Other Such Organizations&amp;quot; as a point of
departure, I will share my experience and derived best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &amp;quot;basics&amp;quot;, like how to use documents and spreadsheets, to working
with databases and understanding security, I have given assistance to a
great many groups and the most important part is always the
documentation that I leave behind. I can rarely ever just point people
to the official software or open source project documentation, I almost
always have to rewrite the docs for them in simple language that
references their specific use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish to help community and activist groups make better technical
choices so that they feel more in control of the technologies they use.
My hope is that in sharing my experiences, I can engage in a deeper
dialogue with the technical documentation community about how we can
make technical documentation more accessible, easier to re-use, and
empowering.&lt;/p&gt;
