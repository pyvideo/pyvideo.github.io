most projects that interact with external users. Python's type system is
already widely used for readability, refactoring, and bug detection â€”
this talk will demonstrate how types can also be leveraged to make your
project systematically more secure. We'll investigate (1) how static
type checkers like Pyre or MyPy can be extended with simple library
modifications to catch vulnerable patterns, and (2) how deeper
type-based static analysis can reliably flag remaining use cases to
security engineers. As an example, I'll focus on a basic security
problem and how you might use both tools in combination, drawing from
our experience deploying these methods to build more secure applications
at Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
