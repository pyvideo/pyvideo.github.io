not so big, you know that usually 80% of the time is needed to clean,
prepare and arrange them. We can then spend the other 20% of the time
enjoying our beloved data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that you may know less is that in the last years, the Neo4j
graph database went into the light of being the “right” place to store
data, thanks to its capacity of direct modelling relations among data,
its high availability and its easy, fast and clean query language
Cypher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I’m going to show you some tips to set up in the right way
your data using Pandas, in order to proper model and import them into
Neo4j. A Neo4j Python driver is available to easily import Cypher
queries embedded in Python code. Still, the py2neo package allows
building and querying your database right within your favourite snake
command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget about “tall as teen” SQL queries here; thanks to Pandas, Python
and Cypher modelling, loading and query your database is going to be
really straightforward. After this talk, you’ll can’t wait to give Neo4j
a try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prerequisite: a little knowledge of Pandas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that our beloved Python can do everything, and today we are
learning how to use it to build a micro-simulation model of mobility!
Thanks to SUMO, a microscopic traffic simulation package written in C++
and Python, we discover how to analyze vehicle, pedestrian and train
flows very easily! In this talk I present SUMO, an open source, highly
portable, microscopic and continuous traffic simulation package designed
to handle large networks. Within SUMO, you can build multi-modal
transportation networks, including demand (flows of vehicles,
pedestrians, buses, trains) and network characteristics (traffic lights,
junctions, bike lanes etc.), running simulations over large urban
networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in C++, it comprises several functions and tools written in
Python, as well a complete package called sumolib, a set of Python
modules for working with SUMO networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will learn how to import a network from OpenStreetMap in one click
thanks to a Python script, set some traffic flows and run a simulation
within the SUMO-GUI, a perfect interface to see your cars, bicycles,
buses flowing on the network. Typical outputs that we can get and
visualize with Python include vehicle information data, trajectories,
speed, delays and emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a mobility passioner or a professional engineer dealing with
traffic problems, tired of spending tons of money on commercial
software, you should definitely give SUMO a try.&lt;/p&gt;
