And getting a social scientist involved means that it will be more accurate, because panic and perfectly rational behavior are both myths. Learn about disaster myths, exactly how social science can be used in disaster modeling, how it's being used now, and why having more software developers involved would be great for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this talk, you should have some ideas about the ways programming and social science are working together to make the future both more exciting and more predictable - and maybe ideas for a project of your own. There will be a somewhat long question period because of the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
