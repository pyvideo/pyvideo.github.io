It easily pulls video data from tech like the Kinect, Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive, and streaming internet video. Because it uses Python, you can leverage the entire ecosystem of Python tools to push your art to the next level; everything from simple parsing of TCP messages, to transforming 3D geometry with numpy, to complex signal processing with scikit. Not only that; TouchDesigner allows Python programmers to create complex, portable user interfaces for any project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using TouchDesigner to develop interactive dance visualizers using the Kinect, and I'm excited to show what it is capable of. I'll give a high-level overview of how to start working with 2D/3D data in TouchDesigner, and Iâ€™ll demo a simple project that uses real-time data from Websockets to generate 3D media. All of you in the audience will contribute!&lt;/p&gt;
