&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how web maps are created? Ever wondered if you could build
something like Google Maps over a weekend? You probably can't, but this
talk will show you the basics of what you need to know, such as
importing data, rendering maps and even building simple routes. And all
of this in Python!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: * Learning how OSM data looks * Parsing and importing the
data * Rendering maps with Mapnik * Bits of code required to build
geocoder * Building simple router with Python and PostGIS * And anything
else I forgot to mention in this abstract but will talk about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitions: OpenStreetMap - the so-called &amp;quot;Wikipedia of maps&amp;quot; project,
with thousands of contributors who edit the map data of the whole world.
Unlike similar projects, the map data is completely free (both as in
beer and as in speech) and thus anyone can make use of it. Mapnik -
rendering framework, created specifically for OpenStreetMap, written in
C++ and Python. PostGIS - an extension of PostgreSQL database, with
support for many useful GIS features.&lt;/p&gt;
