&lt;p&gt;The blindness of modeling and how to break through. Training models from data is just like painting or capturing pictures from the world. From different angles, you will see the different pictures. The pictures are just the approximations of the world! So do the models! There must be some blindnesses behind the approximations. In this talk, we will point out several types of blindnesses in modeling procedures and introduce the solution of breaking through them.&lt;/p&gt;

to deal with almost every kind of data (numeric, text, image, audio,
...) you met. Besides, there are also lots of modeling tools in python,
you can use them to build the FIRST LIGHTING MODEL to solve the
problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you want to solve problems deeply, most of time, you need to
write down the customerized models and solve them by yourself. Instead
of using fast modeling tools, you need to know more about the essential
things in modeling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a model ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How models solve your problems ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the connection between models and data ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the important data ? important model ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deeply believe ... The more the connection between models and data you
know, the deeper the problem you can solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Outline: What is Modeling ?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Data, Model, Evaluators&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Direct Problem: Data + Evaluators → Model&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Inverse Problem: Data + Models → Evaluator&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Hacking Models with Metric Learning&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Data as a Model &amp;amp; Model as a Data&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Duality between Dimension Reduction and Clustering&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
