possible for the public to access sub-weekly and even daily imagery of
the Earth's entire landmass. In this tutorial, you will gain hands-on
experience exploring publicly-available satellite imagery and using
Python tools for geospatial and time-series analysis of medium- and
high-resolution imagery data. At the end of the workshop, you will apply
what you've learned to investigate real-world environmental and
humanitarian challenges. This tutorial is for intermediate Python
developers. It would help if learners attending this workshop also had
some familiarity with map data, but the instructors will not assume
background knowledge of satellite imagery or geo- data tools. Learners
will come away from the workshop with: - a solid understanding of
satellite imagery and geo-data concepts; - strategies for wrangling,
processing, and analyzing satellite imagery using several Python- based
open-source toolkits; - hands-on experience using satellite imagery to
better understand and address real-world challengesPresenter(s):

for data lovers. Python can make the process fun and exciting. We will
present techniques of data analysis, along with python tools that help
you explore and map data. Our talk includes examples that show how
python libraries such as csvkit, matplotlib, scipy, networkx and pysal
can help you dig into and make sense of your data.&lt;/p&gt;

diversity outreach workshop. In the time since, the group has has moved
the needle and inspired other communities to do the same. In this panel,
you will hear communities like PyStar Philly, Railsbridge Boston, and
the Chicago Python Workshop discuss their successes and difficulties
with diversity-oriented outreach.&lt;/p&gt;

What stories can
that data tell us about how we think, work, and interact? How would one
go about finding and telling those stories? This two-part talk is a
soup-to-nuts tour of practical data visualization with Python and web
technologies, covering both the extraction and display of data in
illumination of a familiar dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
