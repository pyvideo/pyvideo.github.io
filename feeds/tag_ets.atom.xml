Some of these packages are bundled together to form “The Enthought Tool Suite” or ETS. While ETS is best known in scientific computing circles, these tools are general purpose and can be used for a variety of applications In this talk we provide an overview of ETS. We provide an overview of the functionality and benefits of using some of the core ETS packages namely, Traits, TraitsUI, Chaco, Mayavi and Envisage. We will provide examples of these packages and highlight the benefits of using the ETS.
Enthought is also working on a new Pythonic, toolkit-independent, declarative DSL to build GUIs called Enaml. We will take a sneak peek at some of Enaml’s features.&lt;/p&gt;
