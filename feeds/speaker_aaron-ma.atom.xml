Stop taking ML as a threat and learn it today as not learning it is a HUGE LOSS! Get started today with ML in Aaron's remarkable 45-mins talk. We will begin by talking about the paradigm of ML, then taking a deep dive into Neural Networks and building a Neural Network from scratch with Keras and TensorFlow (the hottest machine learning framework). You'll master the magic of neural networks that are powering incredible advances both in AI, self-driving cars, and much more! Finally, we will finish off by talking about Reinforcement learning and how it is empowering YouTube suggestions along with tips-and-tricks from a specialist plus a grand finale mind-blowing demo. Ready to master the paradigm of ML? Let's get started.&lt;/p&gt;
