Dubious “Land and Expand” strategies. We have all
heard about outsourced software projects that run far past schedule and
obliterates the budget, yet somehow fail to meet even basic
requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can this happen. How can your company reduce the risks of delegating
software development to an external party?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Principal–Agent Problem is a well researched dilemma in economic
literature. It occurs when a person or entity (“agent”), is tasked to
work on behalf of another person or entity (&amp;quot;principal&amp;quot;). When the two
parties have divergent interests, the agent might act contrary to the
best interests of the principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Examples of principal-agent relationships are:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Employer vs Employee&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Shareholder vs Management&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Voter vs Political party&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Contractor vs Software Consultant&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a firm decides to outsource software development to a third party,
there is an economic divergence of interest at play, as both parties
seek to maximize profit. The contractor wants its requirements met at
low cost and on a predictable schedule. The third party, when acting
nefariously, can maximize its own gains by extending the project,
utilizing junior or low-cost labor, and creating a relationship of
dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session we will look into some nefarious techniques and
practices used in the IT consulting industry and how best to avoid them.
We will also learn why it is particularly hard to mitigate the risks of
outsourced software development.&lt;/p&gt;
