tests, have had a profound influence on multiple fields, including
medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, and advertising. In software
development, multiple techniques are used to define product
requirements; controlled experiments provide a valuable way to assess
the impact of new features on customer behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having run hundreds of experiments on more than 20 websites, including
some of the world’s largest, like msn.com and bing.com, we have learned
some important practical lessons. These lessons, even for seemingly
simple univariate experiments, aren’t taught in Statistics 101.&lt;/p&gt;
