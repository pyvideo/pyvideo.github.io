Но хорошо находить информацию нужно не только в Интернете. У нас внутри есть огромный интранет –&amp;nbsp;большое количество внутренних сервисов, по которым тоже нужно эффективно искать. Мы любим Python и активно его используем для того, чтобы сделать поиск удобным, быстрым и максимально точно отвечающим на вопросы сотрудников. У нас довольно интересная инфраструктура –&amp;nbsp;есть компонентны и на Django, и на Tornado. Мы активно используем Celery с разными брокерами. Взаимодействуем с внутренними инструментами и API, чтобы переиспользовать наработки большого Поиска. Этот же механизм стал недавно использоваться для поиска по данным организаций внутри сервисов Яндекс.Коннекта. Я хочу рассказать, как все эти компоненты взаимодействуют и какие есть интересные особенности.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of them are quite easy for using: a developer can read, for example, about f-strings and they can start using them in their programs as soon as possible. But sometimes features are not so evident, and a new frame evaluation API is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new frame evaluation API was introduced to CPython in PEP 523 and it allows to specify a per-interpreter function pointer to handle the evaluation of frames. It might not be evident how to use this new feature in everyday life, but it’s quite easy to understand how to build a fast debugger based on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we are going to explain how standard way of debugging in Python works and how a new frame evaluation API may be useful for creating the fast debugger. Also we will consider why such fast debugging was not possible in the previous versions of Python. If someone hasn’t made a final decision to move to Python 3.6 this talk will provide some new reasons to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

Among the spin-offs of such initiatives were the greenlet package and the gevent library, based on this package. The gevent library is used in various projects to this day. My report will be about this library, what's under its hood, and what it can be useful for. I will bring architectural solutions for building asynchronous RPC based on gevent, and will talk about the problems you might encounter when using it. In the end, I'll show you how the same things can be implemented with the help of standard tools of the modern Python (the asyncio library), and will compare these approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

In my presentation, I will describe what are requirements for the development process and the project infrastructure to take advantage of micro (services) quickly, efficiently and quite painlessly. We'll talk about what problems a pythonist will face when using microservices in production. Let's find out best practices to choose the framework or utilitarian library for a particular type of microservice. I'll tell you how to provide fault tolerance and handle errors from third-party integrations correctly. Let's go through the list of classic developers mistakes and a little bit of the topic of data caching.&lt;/p&gt;

Moreover it's a swiss army knife with all kinds of extensions: Item pipelines, HTML/CSS selectors, Middlewares. In this talk, I’m going to explain how the Scrapy’s internal processing pipeline works, the design of it’s downloader queue and all the things needed to debug it: Scrapy shell, telnet console, memory consumption debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrapy is a 100% asynchronous web scraping framework built with Twisted event loop with 21K GitHub stars!&lt;/p&gt;

In modern times, we are already able to just build the whole complex pipelines and deploy applications directly on the cloud, without &amp;quot;cutting&amp;quot; it to separate instances. And you may don't even care how and where things are going to be executed. It's just several lines of code and no more non-trivial maintenance and deployment, just pure business logic. Magic? No, it's serverless.&lt;/p&gt;

We've spent last decade improving on the performance of the language (but not the default implementation). What we've learned so far is not the common interpretation of that question - things like dynamic dispatch, dynamic typing and interpreter can all be worked around.
What we've learned are the places in the Python language which make unnecessary string copies, but are easier to write, a lot of &amp;quot;pythonic&amp;quot; constructs that cannot be implemented efficiently and a lot of quirks that make some constructs slow for no good reason. Additionally we're overwhelmed by the sheer size of the &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; language and the necessity of supporting C extensions.
This talk will cover detailed view of those problems and some potential remedies.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll introduce you to the architecture we used for both data processing approaches and will pay attention to all the components. Then we'll duscuss peculiar properties of python that matter when implementing data procession algorithms for HIVE, touch upon fundamental problems of storing aggregates as well as pros and cons of alternative approach. I'll bring you details on how we use Spark for changing sessions calculation, we'll discuss emerging issues and existing solutions. In the end i'll show you our results of performance tests and will introduce you to several pitfalls we've met on our way.&lt;/p&gt;

Moreover Python's high-level syntax and relatively lightweight Python VM accelerate development process, reduce size of project code, speed up testing and bug-fixing and so on. All the features highly decrease cost of development and allow small teams to write a complex application that works on all the major desktop platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this sounds great but as usual in practice there are a lot of technical issues in this approach. This presentation is dedicated how to avoid potential architectural problems in multi platform development and reach project goals without serious troubles. We will overview major widgetsets and will try finding a silver bullet for multi platform desktop development.&lt;/p&gt;

But how do you keep it maintainable and easy to understand as it grows beyond a million lines of code? Come learn how annotating it with types makes your program better for human readers and more robust during execution. No prior Haskell experience required!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an hour I'm going to demonstrate real world problems of big software projects that type annotations solve. The talk is going to explain how you can introduce typing to an already mature application, what is a sensible workflow to follow and how to solve common gotchas.

JMeter because of hundred of plugins? Tsung because of easy scaling? Gatling because of support for different protocols? And why not use Python for load test scenario? I'll share the experience of load testing with Yandex Tank and BFG - load generator which supports user-defined scripts in Python. We'll focus on one recovery test realized with BFG. I'll show how Python scenarios can be used for load, performance and another non-functional testing. Why it helped to make load testing a part of a development cycle. And how BFG became more popular than jMeter in our daily practice.&lt;/p&gt;

And what exactly can you contribute to this IoT mayhem, our dearest Python developer? Imagine yourself building new things, connecting existing ones into something exciting and (maybe) having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will look at Python's place in a IoT world, how to use it for interaction with various peripherals and what hardware platforms are best suited for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intended auditory: middle-level (and higher) software developers, makers and IoT enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abundance of computation resources are getting us lazy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can't win against IoT, so all that left is to join the fray.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python can be used for low-level interaction with various hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MicroPython - stripped-down version of Python 3 for use on various microcontrollers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python ecosystem has various libraries for working with industry-proven communication protocols (e.g. ZigBee).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safety first!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Как вообще удалось заставить Python работать на чём-то с всего лишь 16 килобайт памяти? Сильно ли пришлось урезать для этого язык? (спойлер: нет!) Что интересного можно делать с железками и MicroPython? Разные сенсоры, акселерометры, светодиоды, моторчики — вот это всё.&lt;/p&gt;
