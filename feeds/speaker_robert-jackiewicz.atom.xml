&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION
Python is great at helping ideas and companies get off the ground quickly. It is elegant, simple and offers great library support for getting ideas off the ground and into the hands of customers. But with success we need to adjust the way we write python to support more &amp;quot;enterprise&amp;quot; development. This space is filled with industry buzzwords like Domain Driven Design, Hexagonal architecture, design patterns, CQRS, Kafka, and the list goes on and on. But what is missing is advice on how to structure your classes, package and overall code to support this intimidating world of enterprise development. This talks is about those techniques to keep you code simple regardless of framework choices that made you successful in the first place while preventing the dreaded &amp;quot;rewrite&amp;quot; phase of your application.&lt;/p&gt;
