We are at the point where it is impossible to read everything about a subject.
The purpose of this talk is to demonstrate how we can build a text processing pipeline to extract information by reading website pages.
We will go through the conception of a text processing pipeline to detect relationships between Fictional Characters of any show.
The goal is to be able to remember the characters and their relationships before the release of the next season without having to binge-watch all the seasons again.&lt;/p&gt;
