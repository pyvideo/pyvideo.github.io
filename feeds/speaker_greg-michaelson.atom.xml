Not only did that not happen, but even the name “AutoML” has become sullied along with the myth of the citizen data scientist. In this talk, Greg will discuss the launch of a brand new open source project that promises to deliver AutoML as it should have been: open, flexible, code-based, and targeted at the only people generating value from machine learning — data science experts.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk delves into the data-driven strategies that enabled the U.S. government’s vaccine trials to move faster, cutting crucial weeks—6 to 8, by our estimates—off the timeline to deployment. Through sophisticated geospatial modeling, we identified and swiftly mobilized trial recruitment efforts in emerging hot zones, ensuring that each candidate pool was both numerically sufficient and demographically representative. Attendees will discover how advanced analytics, predictive modeling, and interdisciplinary collaboration converged to target the right communities at the right time, ultimately expediting vaccine availability. This behind-the-scenes look at rapid-response data science highlights not just the technical innovations, but the decisive cultural and operational shifts that turned real-time insights into life-saving action.&lt;/p&gt;
