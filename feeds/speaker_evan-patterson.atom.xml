In an effort to reduce communication barriers and enable automation and intelligent tooling, we are developing software to automatically construct language-agnostic semantic models of data science code written in Python or R. In this talk, we introduce our methods and illustrate them by example.&lt;/p&gt;

over the last decade it has grown into a rich and powerful set of
interlocking tools aimed at enabling an efficient, fluid and productive
workflow in the typical use cases encountered by scientists in everyday
research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, IPython consists of a kernel executing user code and capable of
communicating with a variety of clients, using ZeroMQ for networking via
a well-documented protocol. This enables IPython to support, from a
single codebase, a rich variety of usage scenarios through user-facing
applications and an API for embedding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An interactive, terminal-based shell with many capabilities far
beyond the default Python interactive interpreter (this is the
default application opened by the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ipython&lt;/tt&gt; command that most users
are familiar with).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Qt console that provides the look and feel of a terminal, but adds
support for inline figures, graphical calltips, a persistent session
that can survive crashes of the kernel process, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A web-based notebook that can execute code and also contain rich text
and figures, mathematical equations and arbitrary HTML. This notebook
presents a document-like view with cells where code is executed but
that can be edited in-place, reordered, mixed with explanatory text
and figures, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high-performance, low-latency system for parallel computing that
supports the control of a cluster of IPython engines communicating
over ZeroMQ, with optimizations that minimize unnecessary copying of
large objects (especially numpy arrays).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will show how IPython supports all stages in the
lifecycle of a scientific idea: individual exploration, collaborative
development, large- scale production using parallel resources,
publication and education. In particular, the IPython Notebook supports
multiuser collaboration and allows scientists to share their work in an
open document format that is a true &amp;quot;executable paper&amp;quot;: notebooks can be
version controlled, exported to HTML or PDF for publication, and used
for teaching. We will demonstrate the key features of the system,&lt;/p&gt;
