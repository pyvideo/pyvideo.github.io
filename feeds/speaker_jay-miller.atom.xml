But like all things tech there are too many things that keep folx out of the water, and lots of ways we can get them diving into the deep end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shares the perspectives of two developers who benefitted from a community that was welcoming, supportive, and awesome. They’ll share the advice they did and DIDN'T receive; stories from along the way; and how those of us already floating can make room for all the new people wanting to join in on the fun. Grab your floaties, kids—let’s jump in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone can or wants to solely write code for the rest of their working careers, so we'll explore other ways of advancing in your career, including ways that don't involve traditional management roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broader-scale individual contributor roles, such as principal engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running your own consultancy agency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management roles, both technical and non-technical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our panelists include (and more will be added before the session):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charles Rejonis, Chief Products Officer, Wharton Research Data Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elizabeth Christensen, manager at Crunchydata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frank Wiles, founder of REVSYS and former Django Software Foundation President&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew Godwin, longtime Django core contributor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julia Solórzano, [2023 Keynote Speaker](/news/julia-solorzano/)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to be an experienced developer to get something out of this talk; this talk will be helpful to people starting out on their career track so they can know what might lie ahead as well as managers who want to better understand the developer career mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

While searching for things &amp;quot;In Your Area&amp;quot; may be a solution, some topics (like where you want to go to college) can be a little more nuanced. In this talk shows how I use Elasticsearch's accuracy and Google Places API to show college options in a requested area. The example project is a college search app that gives you the ability to look for schools based on an area and indicators like acceptance rates and expected student load debt. I'll show how to perform Places autocorrect query and then use the returned information to curate search results within Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discovering that many major cities in the United States have open data projects that allow for a level of transparency. I was happy to discover that my own city had data available but quickly realized that the data had many issues that would make it difficult to analyze as-is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will show how I was able to consolidate &amp;quot;Calls for Service&amp;quot; to the San Diego Police Department since 2015. This was done by importing the city-provided CSV files into Pandas DataFrames and making modifications to standardize data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also convert approximate location data to a geo_point using Public geoJSON data and the filter capabilities in Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I will show how you can bulk upload the data into and out of Elasticsearch via eland so that it can be visualized in Kibana or a public graphing platform and how I automated this process to check for updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After three amazing in-person conferences, this time we're moving PyCascades online.&lt;/p&gt;

Elastic has an ecosystem of products that to tell a story around both internal and external data. Companies use the Elastic Stack to gain insight on websites, businesses, and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversityorgs.tech allows guests to search for diversity-focused orgs in their area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at web traffic and examine trends in orgs searched. I'll explain ingesting that data from NGINX logs using Beats. We’ll look at analytics from Elastic App Search and visualize this information with Kibana. Finally, we'll use that information to implement a new feature giving people requests based on their perceived area, ALL WHILE REQUIRING NO COOKIES OR TRACKING FROM OUR USERS.&lt;/p&gt;
