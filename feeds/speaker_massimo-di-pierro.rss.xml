interface to the Open Computing Language. OpenCL is a framework to
execute parallel programs across heterogeneous platforms consisting of
of both CPUs and GPUs. OpenCL programs consists of kernels which are
distributed and executed in parallel over processing units.&lt;/p&gt;

driven web applications. It was originally created to address very
specific teaching needs and went mainstream, now counting thousands of
users both in the academic and in the business worlds. Web2py has been
used for teaching University level web development courses in the United
States, South America and Europe, for research projects of public
utility, and for many business applications. In this talk we discuss the
motivations behind web2py, why we think it is important to make web
development easy, where we are and where we should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Massimo Di Pierro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will provide an introduction to web2py with particular focus on its
design objectives, its differences when compared to other web
frameworks, and some of the most recently added features (components,
plugins, openid/oauth integration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web2py is a framework for rapid web application development of secure
database-driven web applications. In this tutorial we will provide a
brief introduction to web2py, the web based IDE, its internal design,
and its internal file organization. We will explain the motivations
behind some of its most controversial design goals. We will also discuss
in some detail its Ajax capabilities by using web2py components and
plugins for modular design of rich web interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a very concentrated version (10%) of a course (CSC438) on
web frameworks the author teaches at DePaul University. The course has
been taught 3 times and the last time counted more than 30 students.&lt;/p&gt;

decisions and its newest features. In particular we will discuss which
design decisions were inspired by other frameworks (Django, Turbogears,
Flask) and which were not and why.&lt;/p&gt;
