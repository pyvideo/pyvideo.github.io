PyGMT is an open-source Python package that specializes in processing and plotting spatial data. We will provide a demonstration of the latest developments in PyGMT, including new features for sampling, projecting, filtering, and analyzing data along with enhancements for visualizing tabular and raster datasets. We will also discuss our progress towards a more Pythonic API through simpler arguments and more informative exceptions. Lastly, we will present ways to get involved with the PyGMT community, including contributing feedback, writing documentation and/or code, and participating in PyGMT events.&lt;/p&gt;
