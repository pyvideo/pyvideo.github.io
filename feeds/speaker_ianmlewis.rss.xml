Luigi allows you to write long running batch processes in pure Python and provides built-in support for Hadoop mapreduce jobs and abstractions for HDFS and local file systems.
I'll show how to use Luigi to perform a simple set of chained mapreduce jobs and show how Luigi helps with dependency resolution, workflow management, and visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
