environments is a key challenge in digital scholarship. The Whole Tale
is a response to this requirement, building and combining components to
provide a virtual research &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; on the web. In this talk, we'll
describe how the Whole Tale project leverages existing Python projects
(Jupyter, PyFilesystem, fusepy, WsgiDAV, Girder and many others) to
bring remote analysis (including code and environment) and data
together, providing persistent workspaces while automatically capturing
provenance and data lineage to facilitate reproducibility and
verifiability -- cornerstones of the scholarly process.Presenter(s):
