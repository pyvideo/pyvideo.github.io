contractors alike typically work with hundreds of buildings and at least
as many boilers. When there is an issue with the boiler, they need to be
able to get as much data about that specific boiler as quickly as
possible. Thankfully, the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB)
and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) have published
databases online with various data on publicly registered boilers and
burners. In this talk, I will discuss the methods I have used to scrape
these boiler and burner data from the web using python libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
