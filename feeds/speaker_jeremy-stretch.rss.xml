What if you want to assign permissions to create, modify, or delete only objects with certain attributes? In NetBox, we did exactly this by leveraging the ORM, JSON, and database transactions. We’ll quickly demonstrate how easy Django makes it to create a custom authentication backend and permission model to accommodate even complex object-based constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
