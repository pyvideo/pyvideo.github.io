You know XML, and so do I
A full implementation's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just gotta tell you how to code this
Gotta make you understand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to set VoIP up
Learn how to tear calls down
Learn how to run high availability, and stateless
Learn how tech makes you cry
Learn how to make upgrades on the fly
Learn how your call will be monitored for quality assurance and training purposes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've known VoIP exists for so long
You've got an idea but
You're too shy to code it
Inside we know it's just a SMOC
We know the rules and we're gonna code it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you ask me how I'm feeling
I'll cover status APIs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to set VoIP up
Learn how to tear calls down
Learn how to run high availability, and stateless
Learn how tech makes you cry
Learn how to make upgrades on the fly
Learn how your call is important to us and will be answered shortly&lt;/p&gt;
