generator for CPython C extensions. It provides better support for
additional compilers, build systems, cross compilation, and locating
dependencies and determining their build requirements. We also
describe how Matplotlib and SymEngine are updated to make use of
&amp;quot;scikit-build&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the scientific packages NumPy, SciPy, SymEngine or Matplotlib
can be used from Python today, since they bundle C, C++ or Fortan
extensions, successfully building the associated binary wheels is
complex and prone to errors. This is a significant barrier to allow
use of these scientific packages on a broader set of platforms like
mobile, Raspberry Pi or HPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate the build process, the scikit-build package is
fundamentally just glue between the setuptools Python module and
CMake. Currently, the package is available to perform builds in a
setup.py file. In the future, the project aims to be a build tool
option in the currently developing pyproject.toml build system
specification.&lt;/p&gt;
