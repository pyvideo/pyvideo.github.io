cornerstone of our upcoming fast-iterating web platform. In this talk
I discuss why and how the architecture has evolved, key decisions
made and the lessons we learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll share the techniques we used for iterating quickly and how the
technology supported (and shaped) them. In addition some quirks and
DRF-specific tricks will be brought along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect a general talk about how Python (and specifically DRF) can be
used as a based for quick product iterations, a discussion regarding
how to build and evolve a platform to meet those needs and some
DRF-specific tidbits. No previous knowledge is required but
experience in web development will make the content more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
