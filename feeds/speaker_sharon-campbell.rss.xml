I&amp;amp;#39;m Sharon, Editorial Manager at DigitalOcean. I&amp;amp;#39;d like to talk about what my team does every day: publish technical content from the wild. We publish content from subject matter experts who not only aren&amp;amp;#39;t professional documentarians, but who don&amp;amp;#39;t even work for the company.
I&amp;amp;#39;ll go over how we solicit submissions, how we select content and authors, how we reject unsuitable applications, how we test and edit the work, and how we build relationships with community writers.
I&amp;amp;#39;ll also contextualize how this works well in the realm of open-source software, and what to consider if you adapt this model for your community.&lt;/p&gt;
