The variable might represent parameters in a machine learning model, trades in a financial portfolio, actuations for controllers of a physical system, or tunable parameters for the design of a physical device. In industry, convex optimization problems are solved to land rockets, allocate financial portfolios, fit machine learning models, and control self-driving cars, among other applications. By abstracting away numerical solvers, CVXPY makes it easy to specify and solve convex optimization problems. CVXPY is best understood as a rewriting system for convex optimization problems, with a user-facing front-end and a solver-facing back-end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Front-end: CVXPY provides users with a large library of atomic functions, like exp, log, and norm. These atoms can be composed according to a simple rule that guarantees convexity of the composition, forming the grammar of CVXPY. Formulating problems using this rule is known as Disciplined Convex Programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back-end: When the &lt;cite&gt;solve&lt;/cite&gt; method on a problem is called, CVXPY transparently rewrites it into a terse numerical format expected by a solver; it will then call the solver, and return a solution to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will cover the basics of convex optimization with CVXPY, with an emphasis on real-world applications. Attendees will come away with:
* A thorough understanding of what a convex optimization problem is.
* The ability to model real-world problems as convex optimization problems, using CVXPY.
* The ability to use CVXPY Parameters to solve many related convex optimization problems in a short amount of time.
* An exposure to advanced features included in CVXPY, including quasiconvex programming, log-log convex programming, and differentiating through parametric convex optimization problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target audience:
* Computationally-minded scientists and engineers from any field who are interested in learning about a powerful tool for solving mathematically modeled problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prerequisites:
* Basic understanding of linear algebra and probability.
* We do _not_ assume any familiarity with convex optimization or mathematical programming.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
