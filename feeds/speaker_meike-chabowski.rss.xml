related” part of the game. Roughly a year ago, I decided to change
something. Well – still working in IT, and still working in the same
company … But I moved from a Product Marketing role (which I hold for
about 17 years) to R&amp;amp;D, because the documentation team “made me an offer
I couldn’t refuse”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I interacted with many of our engineers before, and of course
I also knew most of the documentation team members before. But in
retrospective, I can say that I somehow lived on “another planet”
before, and that my first year as documentarian in an open source
software company was definitely deeply eye-opening for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious now, join the talk and hear more about my main
takeaways regarding documentation in general and the experiences with my
team in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
