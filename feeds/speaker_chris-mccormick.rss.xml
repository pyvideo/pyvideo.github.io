&lt;p&gt;Presented by Mr. Chris McCormick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover several real-world uses of Python in cross platform
video game and multimedia projects, and the tips, tricks, and techniques
I learned along the way whilst working on those projects. I'll speak
about the issues involved in cross platform desktop dev with wxPython,
interfacing with multimedia programs using subprocess, spreading load
with multiprocessing, developing for the web on small devices with
Django, and when and how to write custom network servers using asyncore.&lt;/p&gt;

user-created-content platform video game written in Pygame. It's a bit
like a cross between a wiki and a game, because the players can also
create and edit the levels. In this talk we will look at the development
of the game over the last three years, including what has changed since
PyCon 2010. We'll examine the sound, graphics, and networking
architecture which is built upon pygame and asyncore (PodSixNet).&lt;/p&gt;
