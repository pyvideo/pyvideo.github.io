How do you know it stayed correct after you changed it? To me, the answer lies in automated testing and I would like to introduce you to this vast topic. We will start by discussing the various ways of testing software and their relative advantages and disadvantages.â€¯ We will proceed to develop some simple code that encapsulates the common problems faced while testing and I will show you how to overcome them and engineer your test code using tools in the unittest module. We will also peek behind the curtains to see how a testrunner executes your code. By the end of the talk, I hope you will have a solid understanding of basics of testing and a newfound appreciation of classic paintings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is mostly aimed at people new to software testing. However, more experienced developers are also welcome there will be plenty of questions for the audience and a good number of charades inspired guessing!&lt;/p&gt;
