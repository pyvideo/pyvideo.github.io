Is it possible that two loops with same complexity have different runtimes? Which mechanism is the fastest and the slowest, Which one should you use to optimize your application?&lt;/p&gt;

not very precise in Python. What makes floats so special and weird that
a simple arithmetic operation might not yield the expected result? Why
is it so? For instance, what happens when you run the following line on
the Python terminal: 0.1+0.1+0.1==0.3? What will be the output? True or
False?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small talk will focus on the underlying behavior of floating
arithmetics precision and then discuss a few potential solutions to the
problem in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
