thinking about and developing regex statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working with UNIX for decades now and, although i always
managed to avoid Perl, i have been intrigued with Regex constructs ever
since my first encounter. These weird unreadable things that can
transform text like nothing else or can find what i’m looking for in
massive files, in no time at all. I’ve created regexes that only appeal
to the most nerdiest of nerds and i’ve stunned colleagues by fixing
their futile regex attempts in just a few keystrokes. But when Damian
Conway showed me how regexes really work i was awestruck. And now i want
to share this knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at pythonistas that have some experience with the re
module. I will take some easy examples and explain in plain english how
a regex engine searches for a match. This will show that a regex is not
some mysterious incomprehensible pattern description or declarative
blueprint. Instead it is a small program that is very good at comparing
single characters. Like any programming language it turns out that once
you understand the rules and structure it suddenly becomes so much
easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this new found knowledge we will up the ante and try some more
difficult stuff, adding other semantics and some tips and tricks. We’ll
look at some pitfalls, maybe compare regex to python solutions and have
a look at some regexes found in the wild (either on my drive or on
github).&lt;/p&gt;

You can learn it by yourself by reading an
excellent document [What's New in Python 3.8][1]. I'm not going to
retell this document. Instead I'll focus on things barely described
there or not mentioned at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why will the new features appear in Python 3.8 and what's the story
behind them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is being discussed and developed now, but won't appear in Python
3.8?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll share the news I learned at PyCon 2019 from the talks and
discussions with Python core developers. I'll mention the following
topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New syntax: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;x := expr&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;f(...,&lt;/span&gt; /, &lt;span class="pre"&gt;...)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;f'{expr=}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New types: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Literal&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Final&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;TypedDict&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Future features of typing and async/await&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New approaches to optimizing Python: sub-interpreters, mypyc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

use of native code? The Cython compiler for Python solves all of these
problems in a pythonic way, by compiling Python code to optimised C
code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cython [1] has a very long history of faithfully helping users to solve
their Python performance problems and integrating native code into
Python in production critical settings, while stimulating somewhat less
confidence with its 0.x versioning scheme. For the next Cython version,
a stable 3.0 release, we are planning to clean up several historically
grown issues in the language to make the Cython compiler more friendly
for modern Python users to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will show how Cython can be used for compiling and
speeding up Python code, using fast native data structures and
libraries. I will then give an overview of the changes that are on their
way for the 3.0 release and how they will affect the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the basic ideas behind JIT compilers are easy to understand, as
this talk aim to show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a live-coding exercise: we will start from a blank page and
write a working (albeit simple and limited) JIT compiler from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

In other words,
it's an interpreter for the Python language that can act as a full
replacement for the reference interpreter, CPython. It's optimised to
enable efficient just-in- time (JIT) compilation of Python code to
machine code, and has releases matching versions 2.7, and 3.6. It now
also supports the main pillars of the scientific ecosystem (numpy,
Cython, scipy, pandas, ...) thanks to its emulation layer for the C API
of CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The PyPy JIT is often just described as &amp;quot;magically running your code
faster&amp;quot;, but is actually what is known as a &amp;quot;meta-tracing JIT&amp;quot;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A tracing JIT optimises loops by recording and optimising a single,
hopefully representative, execution of the loop. While crude, that
approach is known to be effective for just-in-time compiler.
Additionally, PyPy's JIT is &amp;quot;meta&amp;quot; in the sense that it traces the
execution of the interpreter while it runs some user-code instead of
tracing the user-code directly. This again simplifies the compiler. We
will explore how all this works together and is implemented (spoiler:
it's Python all the way down!).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk assumes no prior knowledge of compiler theory nor of PyPy
internals, and should be of interest to anybody who wishes that their
pure-Python code would run faster. The audience will gain a firmer
understanding of how PyPy operates and optimises code, and how to how to
get the most out of the PyPy JIT.&lt;/p&gt;

But even if you
understand what they do, it's not always obvious what you can do with
them. Sure, from a practical perspective, they let you remove repeated
code from your callables. And semantically, they let you think at a
higher level of abstraction, applying the same treatment to functions
and classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what can you actually do with them? For many Python developers I've
encountered, decorators sometimes appear to be a solution looking for a
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll show you some practical uses for decorators, and how
you can use them to make your code more readable and maintainable, while
also providing more semantic power. Moreover, you'll see examples of
things would be hard to do without decorators. I hope that after this
talk, you'll have a good sense of how to use decorators in your own
Python projects.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you wish it
ran faster, using the full potential of your CPU?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you should try Numba, a JIT compiler that translates a subset of
Python and Numpy code into fast machine code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain how Numba works, and when and how to use it for
numerical algorithms, focusing on how to get very good performance on
the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand this talk, only a basic knowledge of Python and Numpy is
needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn how Python compiles functions to bytecode and how Numba
compiles bytecode to machine code. Why algorithms implemented using
Numpy sometimes don't yield great performance, and how to do better
using Numba. You will learn about the &amp;#64;numba.jit and &amp;#64;numba.vectorize
decorators and how to create functions that use the CPU well by using
e.g. multi-threading (several CPU cores), vector instructions (single
instruction multiple data) and fast math (trade float accuracy for
speed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will also learn when it does and doesn't make sense to use Numba, by
contrasting it briefly with some other options for high-performance
computing from Python: PyPy, C, C++, Cython, Numexpr, Dask, PyTorch,
Tensorflow and Google JAX&lt;/p&gt;
