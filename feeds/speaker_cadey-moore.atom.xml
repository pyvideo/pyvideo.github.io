PyCaret is a low-code, open-source machine learning library for Python,
and PyCaret can be integrated within Microsoft Power BI. This empowers
citizen data analysts and data scientists to add machine learning to
their dashboards and reports within minutes. In this demonstration, I'll
give an overview of PyCaret and outline the different ways it can be
used to enrich your Power BI reports and dashboards. I'll detail the
necessary set-up steps to start using PyCaret’s machine learning
capabilities in Power BI. Finally, I'll demonstrate how to train and
implement an unsupervised anomaly detector in Power BI using PyCaret.&lt;/p&gt;
