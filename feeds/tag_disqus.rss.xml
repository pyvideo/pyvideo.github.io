&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practice iterative development like the pros. Release sooner, faster,
and more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous deployment (and testing) has started to become a reality for
many companies. It brings to light one of the many problems that face
large product teams, but also creates some of its own. This talk will
focus on the pros and cons of continuous deployment, how DISQUS switched
from the recurring release cycle to continuous releases, as well as
providing tips and arguments for adopting it in your workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by David Cramer and Jason Yan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disqus, one of the largest Python applications on the web, will explain
how they deal with scaling complexities in a growing startup. Founded in
2007, Disqus maintains a small engineering team reaching over 400
million users a month. Being powered by Python has allowed quick
iteration of the application, without sacrificing code quality and
performance. The talk will cover key parts of the architecture and
development process at Disqus, including hardware, databases, and common
bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
