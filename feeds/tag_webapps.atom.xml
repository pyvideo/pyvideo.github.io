Batteries Included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented by Michael Carter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to supercharge your python web applications (Django, Pylons,
TG, GAE, Werkzeug, WSGI, etc) with real-time features! Presenceful and
moderated chat? About 10 minutes, seriously. A real-time graph to
monitor the CPU? Less than five. If you pay attention for at least half
of this talk, you'll leave confident and ready to take advantage of
WebSocket, Comet, and the world, thanks to Hookbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hookbox (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hookbox.org/"&gt;http://hookbox.org&lt;/a&gt;) is a Python and
Eventlet- based Comet-server/message-queue which tightly integrates with
existing web application infrastructure via web hooks and a REST
interface; Hookbox’s purpose is to ease the development of real-time web
applications, with an emphasis on tight integration with existing web
technology. Put simply, Hookbox is a web-enabled message queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browers may directly connect to Hookbox, subscribe to named channels,
and publish and receive messages on those channels in real-time. An
external application (typically the web application itself) may also
publish messages to channels by means of the Hookbox REST interface. All
authentication and authorization is performed by an external web
application via designated “webhook” callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we cover the broad principles of Hookbox, then examine a
few short examples in depth, including presenceful and moderated chat,
real-time graphing, and, of course, a game. The code examples are very
purposefully brief; the important parts of the talk deal with the
interaction model between browser, web framework, and Hookbox --
everything else follows naturally and easily into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience need not be familiar with a particular web framework over
another, but they must be proficient with at least one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this talk is aimed at a novice level, we'll also spend some time
talking about the more advanced features that Hookbox provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployed web applications are typically run on top of stacks of highly
configurable middleware. The number of tunable parameters and their
impact are rarely fully explored. Using SciPy and a set of common
Python-based web tools this session will present a new method of
automatically tuning a typical LAMP stack for optimal performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployed web applications typically run on top of stacks of configurable
technology (e.g. web servers, interface modules, software load
balancers, databases). Each of these components often has dozens of
tuneable parameters. How many times are those values typically tweaked
before a final set of tuned parameters are settled on? What criteria are
typically used to determine the optimal set?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session presents a new method of automatically tuning a common LAMP
stack for optimal performance. We explore a solution using some common
Python-based automated deployment and load testing tools and dive into
scientific computing with SciPy.&lt;/p&gt;
