I'm now the leader of our Meetup group!</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2019/help-im-now-the-leader-of-our-meetup-group.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After attending your local dev meetup for months, you suddenly get the
dreaded email: &amp;quot;Your Organizer just stepped down without nominating a
replacement.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the community relies on this meetup! It brings together devs from
all around to engage in networking, learning, and comradery! So you step
up. I mean, how hard could it be, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no. This is much harder than you thought. You have to organize a
venue, figure out refreshments, get a speaker, ensure people show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you'll learn the skills need to start and sustain a
vibrant meetup and tech community.&lt;/p&gt;
