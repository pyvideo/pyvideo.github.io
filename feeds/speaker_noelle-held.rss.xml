future ocean. The recent ProteOMZ expedition provides &amp;gt;6 million
datapoints on the distribution of microbial proteins in this region,
coupled with &amp;gt;6000 chemical and physical measurements. We demonstrate
our approach to analysis of this multivariate data using the Pandas,
Scikit-learn, Biopython, Bokeh, and METATRYP Python tools. We found
interactivity to be key in human lead pattern discovery. We discuss
challenges and solutions to piecing together multiple data types and
Python tools, and discuss our experience as scientists learning to apply
Python packages in our research.Presenter(s): Speaker: Noelle Held,
