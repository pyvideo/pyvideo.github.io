We will learn about dis, a library for analyzing bytecode of Python code, timeit, a library for measuring execution time of Python code snippets, and pre-commit, a git-hook framework that automatically searches for and corrects parts to be caught during code review using git-hook, from the basic usage of pre-commit to how to use it during code review.&lt;/p&gt;
