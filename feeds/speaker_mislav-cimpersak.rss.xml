management while still having no idea how to manage even your own time.
After several years of fairly regular software developer career path,
I've found myself in a new role that I've unconsciously put myself into.
Being a solid senior developer, management at the time agreed that I am
a good candidate for the team lead. Being promoted to a new personal
level of incompetence I felt lost and confused in my new role, but made
a pact with myself to see this one through to the end. And so it came
that for the past few years, I've been development team lead for several
teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With zero formal training, relying on my intuition and various random
pieces of advice I picked up from people smarter than me I've more or
less successfully lead my teams to their goals. On that path, I've
learned tremendously, improved myself and hopefully, my teams. I would
like to share what worked and what didn't, my emotions, my regrets, and
my wins.&lt;/p&gt;
