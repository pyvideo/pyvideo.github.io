turbogears2 pluggable extensions part 2 [EuroPython 2012] A Molina - 5
JULY 2012 in &amp;quot;Track Ravioli&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TurboGears 2.1 release series has deeply focused on speeding up the
development process for rapidly prototyping full featured applications.
This has lead to a many improvements to the CRUD extension and to the
support to pluggable applications. Mastering those tools can make
possible to build a complete application without much effort using the
partials made available by the pluggable applications and exposing
administrative interfaces in a bunch of lines of code using the CRUD
extension both using SQLA and MongoDB.&lt;/p&gt;
