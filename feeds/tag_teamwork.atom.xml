This talk is about best practices for processes on data science teams, taken from two teams I've worked on. Some topics I’ll cover are: tracking your work, organizing your code, and deploying models. These tips are meant to be utilized by any teammate including managers and individual contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audience Level: Beginner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements: None&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most engineers who get promoted to the role of a team lead, tech lead or
lead developer (regardless of the wording of the title) feel like they
were thrown in cold waters as they, most probably, lack prior training
or education on the subject matter. Most of us that survive and actually
get to like the new role and arrive at really good results, manage to
educate themselves on the skills and habits required to become an
effective team leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will cover the most important lessons about being an
effective team lead without any previous knowledge about the subject.
This is a practical talk and the audience will walk away with a lot of
material and advice to upgrade their engineering leadership game, as
well as a recommended set of resources for further study. The talk is
primarily focused on developing leadership skills and is tailored
towards engineers and software teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The learning goals are: - How to develop practical leadership skills for
your day-to-day job - Understand the core components of leadership: ATM
(Ability, Team, Mission) - How to build teamwork on a foundation of
trust - How to overcome the main dysfunctions to look in order to
tighten up your team - Increase your awareness of the main anti-patterns
that team leads end up doing&lt;/p&gt;

With the entire population of two continents waiting for his go-live, their handlebar moustaches aquiver, he demonstrated in fine form just how spectacularly a big project can be a bigger disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tale of long-winded rants, spectacular sideburns, and gentlemen scientists behaving badly. It is also a lesson about the importance of honest reflection in technical teamwork. Lilly outlines some of the mistakes made during one of the biggest tech delivery projects in history, and how a constructive view of failure helped to turn it all around. Through the public meltdowns of Wildman Whitehouse you will learn the importance of feedback, how to handle complex tasks gracefully, and the best way to recover from having your pipeline eaten by a whale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to share one recipe of building a community from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reveals hands-on experience about the organisational journey,
including insider details and financial questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information is packed into the story, how one year ago a tempting
idea of making a little Python conference in Munich was born. Six month
later, with poor German skills, no business network and mostly foreign
crew a little idea was converted into PyCon.DE. This conference had a
noticeable Italian flavour, and it’s time to tell why.&lt;/p&gt;

to advertise Python events. This is because Python is a relatively new
programming language in most parts of Africa. In most countries where
global companies like Google, Amazon and Oracle are absent, Python is
rarely used as a programming language in businesses. Despite this, a
number of Python enthusiasts from different parts of the globe have been
working so hard to promote the use of Python in Africa by setting up a
vibrant community on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I will share on the various Python initiatives taking place
in some parts of the African continent and how they have advanced the
use of Python in Africa. I will also present the challenges faced by
developers in Africa in building their Python community. My talk will
also present the milestones that have been achieved so far in trying to
advance the use of Python in Africa. I will also share on the
opportunities that Africa presents in terms of making an impact within
the Python community. I will conclude my talk by highlighting ways in
which we can all make a difference in advancing the use and knowledge of
Python in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
