It is currently driven by twelve microservices. The frontend microservice is implemented in React. Most backend microservices are implemented in Flask. In this session the challenges and solutions of building a microservice architecture for OpenPatch with Flask will be presented. It will be shown how authentication with JWT via a centralized authentification service is implemented, how communication between the microservices with RabbitMQ is integrated, how versioning of microservices (api-endpoints and database-schemas) is used to keep backward-compatibility and what means are set up to ease the development of new microservices. This session should provide insights in the development of a microservice architecture with Flask, which could help others developers to implement their own or to spark the discussion of best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
