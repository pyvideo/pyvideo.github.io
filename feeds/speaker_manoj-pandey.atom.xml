pages. You could revisit your favorite web site every time it updates
for new information. Or you could write a web scraper to have it do it
for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to learn how to scrape the web (and / or organized data sets and
APIs) for content? This talk will give you the building blocks (and
code) to begin your own scraping adventures. We will review basic data
scraping, API usage, form submission as well as how to scrape pesky bits
like Javascript-usage for DOM manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides looking at how websites are put together, we will also discuss
the ethics of scraping. What is legal? How can you be a friendly
scraper, so that the administrator of the website you are scraping won’t
try to shut you down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python may be one of the simplest and most flexible programming languages out there, but it is still a programming language. It still has syntax, datatypes, and some occasional dark corners. Python &amp;quot;&amp;quot;warts&amp;quot;&amp;quot; are things for which people have criticised Python, typically aspects of the language or mechanisms of its implementation, because such aspects either expose certain surprising inconsistencies, are regarded as omissions, or cause irritation for parts of the community in some sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be about common pitfalls (termed warts/landmines) that people face using Python programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author: Manoj Pandey is a rising CS junior, who speaks Python primarily and worked with SquadRun's Engineering Team this summer. Before this he was a Data Analytics Intern at Inspiration Edge and Zouk Fellow at ZoukLoans. He is an avid FOSS enthusiast and Pythonista, almost all of his projects are open-sourced on Github (manojpandey).&lt;/p&gt;
