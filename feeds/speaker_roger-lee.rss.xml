artificial intelligence could be applied in stock trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will introduce how to use Python to extract historical
open-high- low-close (OHLC) data, perform data processing, recognise
patterns in the stock market with artificial intelligence algorithms and
eventually backtest the strategy. The talk will also touch on further
work that could be done, including the scraping and feature engineering
of alternative data.&lt;/p&gt;
