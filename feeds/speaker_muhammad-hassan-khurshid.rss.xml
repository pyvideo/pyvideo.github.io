difficulties to first successes, analyzing the pros and cons of its use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk there will be a small presentation of two projects made
with Genropy. The first project is the one I have worked on in the last
year, a platform that analyzes energy data. The second one is Genrello,
a Trello made with Genropy, developed in spare time as a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk does not require any preconditions for the comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
