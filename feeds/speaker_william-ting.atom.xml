There are many tools that make oncall easier and increase availability, but we'll be mostly focusing on a few principles and design patterns that help make your systems more robust.

Abstract
Feature velocity is typically a higher priority early in a software's lifecycle, but as the system matures there is an effort to start fireproofing the system. On the Yelp Transactions Platform team we've used a combination of circuit breakers, queues, and idempotent operations to minimize downtime and waking up in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll take a look at how these design patterns help us in a distributed system, when they should be used, and common pitfalls associated.&lt;/p&gt;
