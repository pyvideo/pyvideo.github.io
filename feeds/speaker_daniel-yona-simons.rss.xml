As an experienced programmer who was a Python newby, the whole unit test backlog for existing code in my new job was terrifying, so I needed to do something different... Here are practical examples of using Python for web programming where writing unit tests as part of the initial development processes, using Test Driven Design (TDD) methodologies, not only creates reliable regression tests for future code quality and maintenance, but also speeds up the development time, and gives a clearer path to deployment. The focus and examples are on web development, but the lessons and ideas are good for other development areas.&lt;/p&gt;
