Foundation and the global Python community welcome and encourage
participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect,
tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live
up to these principles. We want our community to be more diverse:
whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversity, big deal! As an active members and event organisers (and also
on the minority side of the gender) in the Python community, we have
alway been concern by the question of: Do we truly have a problem in
diversity? Especially, gender diversity. We would like to find out the
truth, by data science, and see if we can find a clue why and how we can
fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we will show the research others did regarding the representation
of women in the R and Python communities [1]. Then, we will show the
research that we did based on our experience and statistic. Including
static analysis of the speakers diversity (regarding gender) at major
PyCon and PyData conferences. Finally, as we all care about diversity
and want improvements, we would like to find out the reason and what we
can do about it. We would propose what we, the minorities and allies,
could do against this seemingly unbalance situation and make the
community better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for all that who cares about diversity in our community.&lt;/p&gt;
