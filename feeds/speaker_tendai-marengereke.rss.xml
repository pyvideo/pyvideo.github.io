The goal of reproducible research is to tie specific instructions to data analysis and experimental data so that scholarship can be recreated, better understood and verified. Often projects are created and kept but it is hard to replicate the results or follow the path used by a researcher. This talk will be on how to achieve reproducibility in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
