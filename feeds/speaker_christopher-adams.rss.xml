DBMS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday 2 p.m.--2:45 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience level: Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using South has its gotchas. I'll go over some of them by using colorful
examples involving data loss and hard-to-recover states. Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic South Disasters: or, why you actually need to pay attention to your
DBMS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people use South to manage database migrations. It's a great
addition to the Django space that allows you to iterate quickly, without
spending a lot of time writing and testing schema migrations. But what
happens when South does things you didn't expect it to do? From the
quibbles of differing database backends to phantom post_save signals
sent during data migrations, this talk will offer a set of warnings
illustrated by example. Prepare to be horrified.&lt;/p&gt;

your views to reduce the number of queries Django uses in evaluating
your model objects and their attributes. Special emphasis will be given
to the powerful methods &amp;quot;select_related&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;prefetch_related.&amp;quot; I
will highlight the problem with a naive use of the ORM, how to target
code for optimization, and the beneficial result.&lt;/p&gt;
