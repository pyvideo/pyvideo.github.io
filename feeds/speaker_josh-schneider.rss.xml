If not, once I show you, you will never go
back to string paths and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;os.path&lt;/tt&gt; ever again! &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pathlib&lt;/tt&gt; turns paths
into path objects, which have attributes and methods that cover a number
of operations. In this talk, we will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about how to create &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Path&lt;/tt&gt; objects, and how this differs on
Windows vs Mac/Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about the many properties of pure paths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about folder operations from &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Path&lt;/tt&gt; objects, such as creating
directory structures and recursive globbing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about file operations, made simpler with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Path&lt;/tt&gt; objects, such
as reading contents, getting properties like file size, and deleting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop messing with string paths and get with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pathlib&lt;/tt&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Does this need a tuple, a dict, a namedtuple, a dataclass, or something else? How do you select what to use, and what are the pros and cons? Let’s explore the options!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaker: Josh Schneider
Josh is a test automation architect and senior developer. He's trained several junior developers, written millions of lines of code, maintained and supported that code, and pushed for process improvements around development standards, code review, design, and support. He spend a lot of time thinking about how to do things “right”, and how to teach other people. Outside of work, he's a dad of 2 nerdy kids, a trained improv comedian, movie lover, and drinker of beer and coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you want to build a framework where expansion can come via installed python packages and modules. There are third party libraries to handle that, but maybe you don't want something that heavy weight, don't want to handle the burden of security and quality testing releases, or just want to write your own so you know how it works. I'll walk you through how to create a pluggable framework where plugins can be delivered as Python packages. I'll show you some useful standard library packages that you need, some pitfalls along the way, and how to get a working prototype in no time!&lt;/p&gt;
