using the module BeautifulSoup. This talk assumes you know some basic
python syntax and data modeling tools. After this talk you should be
able to parse the data on a website and store whatever you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different ways that we can scrape data from a website,
throughout the process we will take care not to overburden the website
and not scrape anything forbidden by the web server. We are going to use
a public library for python called “Beautiful Soup”, this is a really
good tool when we want to take some information from a site. With this
we also are going to mention how can we store this data into a CSV and
Json file.&lt;/p&gt;
