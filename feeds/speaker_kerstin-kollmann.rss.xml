&lt;p&gt;Kerstin Kollmann&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything about the tech industry is as &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; as it is sometimes made out to be – by the media, representations in fiction or indeed members of the tech community themselves – though not everyone is equally aware of how or why it is more difficult &amp;quot;to tech&amp;quot; for some than it is for others, regardless of innate talent or skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk I want to point out some of the barriers which make it harder or less fun for some of us to participate and how everyone can contribute to making tech a little more welcoming for everyone else. (&amp;amp; I might use examples from your new favourite fictional texts while I'm at it.)&lt;/p&gt;
