A web and SMS application in Flask and Twilio to call Farmers.</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pygotham-2016/its-raining-its-pouring-a-web-and-sms-application-in-flask-and-twilio-to-call-farmers.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This talk is about the use of python in building a web application with which we call farmers in less developed countries to capture rainfall occurrence. These data are used to complement lower resolution satellite data, and to potentially update climate models. The application is built in Flask and uses Twilio's API to deliver voicemails to farmers in less developed countries. Twilio's API records farmers' touch tone responses regarding the occurrence of rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;

that have focused on inverse problems in math, data science, tomography,
and image processing. We use a new iterative method coded in Python's
Numpy and show it's ability to recover images compared to previous
approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
