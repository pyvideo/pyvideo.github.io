Instead, ShinyLive turns Shiny for Python apps into pure client-side apps, running on a pure client-side Python installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that same capability has come to Shiny for R, thanks to the webR project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll show you how you can get started with ShinyLive for R, and why this is more interesting than just cheaper app hosting. I'll talk about some of the different use cases we had in mind for ShinyLive, and help you decide if ShinyLive makes sense for your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But… in your Shiny app?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll discuss some ways the Shiny team is combining the magical chaos of LLMs with the structure and control of Shiny. You’ll learn how to use modern chat models to add features to your Shiny apps that will feel like science fiction to your users while minimizing the risks of hallucination, irreproducibility, and data exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

Shiny doesn't require knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and lets you create data-centric applications in a fraction of the time and effort of traditional web stacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Python already has several popular and high-quality options for creating data-centric web applications. So it's fair to ask what Shiny can offer the Python community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will introduce Shiny for Python and answer that question. I'll start with some basic demos that show how Shiny apps are constructed. Next, I'll explain Transparent Reactive Programming (TRP), which is the animating concept behind Shiny, and the reason it occupies such an interesting place on the ease-vs-power tradeoff frontier. Finally, I'll wrap up with additional demos that feature interesting functionality that is made trivial with TRP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk should be interesting to anyone who uses Python to analyze or visualize data, and does not require experience with Shiny or any other web frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
