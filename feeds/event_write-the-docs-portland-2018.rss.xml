the business. I'll share some real-world stories to show what kind of
results you can expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just ask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen for intent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the minimum thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultivate ownership, individual and product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a lifelong learner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opt in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the power of storytelling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might even be a surprise bonus tip.&lt;/p&gt;

Tutorials, How-to topics, and References. Each addresses a different
customer need and each requires different amounts of time and types of
resources to produce. However, what happens on that fateful day you find
that you have more documentation to write than time will allow? (As a
technical writer, I call those weekdays). How can you prioritize which
documentation type and how much of it should be written and which topics
to write first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk provides guidance and encouragement to technical writers to
help them get the information they need to strategically get the right
docs to the right people at the right time—and learn a little bit more
about their stakeholders along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

API reference of endpoints and parameters, or long contextual
instructions, but also code examples that users can cut and paste into
their applications. As a technical writer at Stripe, I’m partially
responsible for maintaining 150 code examples, each of which needs to be
in 8 programming languages. In this presentation, I’ll explain the
processes we’re using, the hurdles we’re facing, and the solutions we’ve
devised thus far to make and maintain code examples that really shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific concepts covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defining a style guide for your code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating code examples programmatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing examples to ensure they work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using common snippets to save time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhancing examples for a better user experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we haven’t solved all our problems in this area, we’ve made
great progress with great results, and I look forward to sharing our
best policies and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

and not enough writers. Enter the documentation internship program,
which connected us with junior and aspiring technical writers and got us
headcount fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will teach you how we recruited, interviewed, and hired
inexperienced writers, and taught them the basics of technical writing…
all without damaging our velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll focus specifically on how our job pitch got us applicants from a
wide array of backgrounds, from screenwriters to college students, how
we made sense of the answers we got through an unpredictable set of
interviews, and how we onboarded writers with strong skills and
aptitude, but no real-world experience.&lt;/p&gt;

consistency, streamline onboarding, and even improve the documentation
non- technical writers create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're creating an internal style guide or a commercially
available reference, though, there are plenty of pitfalls. In this talk,
we'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;style guide assumptions (and how to avoid them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jargon, slang, idioms, and other words with multiple meanings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inclusion, sensitivity readings, and generally making sure you know
how other people hear terms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teaching style across a team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

years working on dictionaries and other reference books. Reference books
and dictionaries have a lot of similarities with documentation: they're
both genres of writing that aim to explain and educate, and are aimed at
an audience that is largely goal-oriented and impatient. In this talk,
I'll give a little bit of background on how reference books
(particularly dictionaries and thesauruses) are made, talk about my
experience in publishing has informed writing documentation and
tutorials (and working with Swagger/OpenAPI), and give some examples of
habits I had to un-learn, too!&lt;/p&gt;

The art and practice of documentation triage</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/write-the-docs-portland-2018/where-do-i-start-the-art-and-practice-of-documentation-triage.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! Someone realizes your awesome product needs equally
awesome documentation, and you’ve earned the job! It’s an exciting new
role, with new goals and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cue the panic: There are too many things to do! Where do I start? How
can I succeed in this role?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been there before. In fact, I’ve done it multiple times. Like
medical triage, you won’t have a lot of time to think before you dive in
and get to work. It’s stressful, even if there are no lives at stake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can be fast and smart. I’ll tell you how to get started (audit
the existing content, create a list of requirements for documentation
tools, ruthlessly prioritize a huge list of tasks) and how to keep going
(build relationships with coworkers in customer-facing roles to learn
what your customers really need from docs, take a moment to pat yourself
on the back every now and then). I’ll also admit to mistakes I’ve made,
and how I’ve learned to avoid them (like trying to do everything myself,
or thinking that time spent planning is taking away from “real work”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your new role will require hard work, but a bit of advice can help you
get started, stay motivated, and avoid pitfalls along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

is any good? What does “good” mean, anyway? Well, you’re not alone - but
the good news is, there’s a way to find out! The secret lies in caring
about your developers and actively working to learn how your docs serve
them (or don’t!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll share the story of Twilio’s journey toward
empathy-driven documentation. By leveraging direct user feedback, user
experience research, and constantly testing the effectiveness of the
docs you provide, you can learn how your users work with (and wish they
could work with) your docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way I’ll share a few tips about what worked well for us, what
ideas didn’t pan out, and some of the documentation principles we’re now
sold on.&lt;/p&gt;

as important as it is stressful. What belongs in there? What constitutes
your &amp;quot;best work&amp;quot;? What if all your work is proprietary? Do you really
need a portfolio if you have a great job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a portfolio is an exercise in documenting yourself: your
writing, your skill, your journey as a professional. Like any other kind
of documentation, it isn't easy or intuitive to create something great.
And like any other kind of documentation, it's worth doing the hard work
to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why you need a portfolio even if you have a stable job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to create a well-rounded portfolio and decide what's your best
work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategies for adding proprietary work (legally!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options to present it that aren't just a series of email attachments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

features and helping confirm the context of content to simply breaking
up walls of text. However, screenshots can carry a lot of overhead,
including localization considerations and short shelf-lives due to
continuous deployment, which may make them more effort than their worth.
For content that appears in context of the UI, screenshots can also be
redundant and unnecessary. As alternatives to screenshots, there are
several visual content strategies to consider to engage audiences and
convey and complement concepts and UIisms, including infographics,
illustrations, and abstract &amp;quot;simplified UI (SUI)&amp;quot; representations. Which
you use depends on your intent and message.&lt;/p&gt;

humans to create, publish and present technical content in a variety of
media. Primarily in text, in the context of a blog or other ‘managed’
calendar-driven web publications. Not technical documentation. Sometimes
it’s a mighty fine line between docs and blogs, but I think we can and
should differentiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore principles and patterns of kind, effective
editorial practice, and nuances of voice, civility, and clear
communication, as they play out when working with a diverse distributed
roster of authors, many of whom are non-native English speakers or
first-time storytellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there’s as much appetite for diversity of voice and point of
view in blogging about software development as there is in speaking
about it at developer conferences. And I’ve got some observations to
share about how we can cultivate that.&lt;/p&gt;

We know good research
helps us to give our readers what they need and poor research can weaken
our docs so it’s time to step up our research game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grounded in the things I’ve learnt (read: mistakes I’ve made) from my
time writing open source documentation for the UK government at
Government Digital Service (GDS), this talk will look at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deciding what - and how - to research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interviewing, simulation and content evaluation techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distinguishing user ‘needs’ from ‘wants’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how the Hawthorne effect can influence research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to feed findings into product and content development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout it all, we’ll cover strategies to avoid common pitfalls, how
to avoid users telling you what you want to hear, how to manage research
with no extra budget and, when it’s all done, how to turn all that

resulted in my being continually called on to help community groups and
fellow organizers understand and more correctly wield technology in
service of their mission. Using my blogpost &amp;quot;Three Tips for Providing
Tech Help to Non-Profits and Other Such Organizations&amp;quot; as a point of
departure, I will share my experience and derived best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &amp;quot;basics&amp;quot;, like how to use documents and spreadsheets, to working
with databases and understanding security, I have given assistance to a
great many groups and the most important part is always the
documentation that I leave behind. I can rarely ever just point people
to the official software or open source project documentation, I almost
always have to rewrite the docs for them in simple language that
references their specific use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish to help community and activist groups make better technical
choices so that they feel more in control of the technologies they use.
My hope is that in sharing my experiences, I can engage in a deeper
dialogue with the technical documentation community about how we can
make technical documentation more accessible, easier to re-use, and
empowering.&lt;/p&gt;

In this
talk, we’ll explore various questions we might frequently ask ourselves
about FAQs, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do readers always seem to want them even though they’re routinely
out of date?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do some readers ignore our carefully crafted pages and use these
giant walls of text as a starting point instead?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some strategies for keeping FAQs up to date?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s the #1 thing FAQs do RIGHT?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we make FAQs more user-friendly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we even actually need FAQs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Caution: May contain opinions.)&lt;/p&gt;

be certain that developers can’t write good help: the prevailing sense
is “Only we can do this.” But those same tech writers often feel under
threat in their jobs - feeling like their organisation doesn’t see their
value, doesn’t understand what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; write the docs? Should all developers write docs as a
matter of course? Is it even worthwhile having specialist writers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I’ll try to find some answers to these questions, based on
my experience working in many teams - both in teams that have valued
tech writing and in teams that haven’t. I’ll talk about the
‘documentarian’ mindset and how that contributes to better software, no
matter what your job title is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll also explore the benefits that come from specialist writers and
generalist developers working together. And I’ll share the ways I’ve
found that people with specialist writer skills (whether they’re
developers, tech writers, or other roles) can make the biggest
difference to user experience, and through that to their organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe you're excited
about a new technology that nobody's written about yet. Maybe you're
unimpressed with the books that are out there on your favorite topic.
Maybe writing a book is on your bucket list. This session will help your
idea reach its potential as a published book. Technical publishing is an
opaque process with a lot of moving parts, which can be confusing for
outsiders to navigate. This session will guide you through the steps you
should take to turn an idea into a proposal that a publisher will
accept, and what to expect from the publishing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a great technical book takes more than a good idea. It also
requires a knowledge of the market, to determine whether there's an
audience willing to buy, or whether the space is too crowded to accept
new entries. Publishers vary in their approach and target markets, so
you need to determine which one will provide the best chance of success.
Self-publishing is an option, but carries its own risks and benefits.
Doing the setup work that you may not have thought about yet will help
you create a proposal that will appeal to publishers, and will also make
the writing process easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a contract with a publisher, or have decided to
self-publish, it's more than just a matter of putting the words in
order. Finding the right environment, setting a schedule, and
communicating with your editor are all critical to success. This session
will explain how the process works, highlight the parts you may not
know, and give you advice on how not to get overwhelmed by your project.&lt;/p&gt;
