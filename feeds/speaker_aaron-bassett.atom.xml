&lt;p&gt;Most developers recognise the importance of testing in building maintainable software, but the sheer volume of tools and approaches can be bewildering and sometimes make it sound like you're talking a different language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll look at the testing pyramid. We'll discuss how approaching our testing in layers can increase developer productivity by reducing the time taken to run our test suites. We'll look at the importance of different testing types including integration and acceptance testing. Finally we'll introduce some tools and packages you can use to make writing good tests easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end you'll be able to talk TDD and BDD like a native!&lt;/p&gt;

How does it work with my models? In this session, we'll answer all these questions and more as we walk through a working example of a React, GraphQL, and Django application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first heard of GraphQL, I had a lot of questions. How is GraphQL different from REST? What're the benefits? When would I use it instead of DRF (Django Rest Framework)? Can I use it with my existing Django models? What about my views? My permissions? Is it difficult to integrate with my frontend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REST has served us well for more than twenty years; of course, I would be wary of any technology which requires a total paradigm shift. In this session, I will answer those questions and hopefully alleviate any apprehension about trying GraphQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll look at a working example of an RGD stack, showing how you can continue to use all the power of your Django backend while rendering and querying your data in React via GraphQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll briefly look at what ADHD is and how it impairs not

changes in the workplace can benefit not just those with ADHD, but
anyone whose work requires creativity or extended periods of focus.
Next, we’ll look at some persistent myths about productivity, and what
you can do personally to increase your concentration and output without
burning out. Then I’ll present some techniques you can rollout within
your team to remove distractions while improving the quality of
communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll start with the current crop of microframeworks, showing how to
achieve the same task in each, before progressing to “Batteries
included” and the more specialised async frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers who perhaps have only used a single framework, this talk
gives them an opportunity to get out and explore the world (of web
frameworks) and broaden their horizons, with plenty of Jules Verne
inspired fun along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

helping our users with the migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Python 3.4, Python has jumped forward, adding many features that
are not available in Python 2.7. Maintaining Python 2 compatibility
means either avoiding these new language features or using backport
libraries that provide an approximation. Neither provided the best
experience for our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll also discuss how we support users of our legacy
library, the benefits that the new library offers, and our experience of

language and core library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is not just for those people with ADHD, although they will
benefit as well. It is for anyone whose job requires long bouts of
focus or “flow”. The primary audience of the talk will be
programmers, but it will also benefit team leads, product managers,
and technical writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no specialist knowledge required to understand this talk. I
do give a brief overview of the start of what ADHD is to establish
context, but the talk focuses on productivity, not psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope people will leave with ideas about how they can make their
workplace, their team and themselves more productive, less stressed
and distracted, and ultimately more happy in their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
