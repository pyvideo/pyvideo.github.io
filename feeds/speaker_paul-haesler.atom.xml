talk the talk on Open Data as an essential component of open government.
But to what extent do they walk the walk? CKAN based data repositories
like data.gov.au (at the Australian federal level) provide powerful APIs
for searching and discovering published data-sets, but at the end of all
that search and discovery, the data-sets themselves sometimes make it
clear that somebody somewhere has missed the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In developing dashboard applications for state and federal government
agencies over the past 6 months, I have seen the good, the bad and the
ugly not only in terms of API design and data set presentation, but also
in terms of commitment to Open Data.&lt;/p&gt;
