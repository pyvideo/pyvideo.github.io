&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Attractive hotel images can influence the hotels that customers book online. However,selecting the best images is not a trivial problem, as there are tens of million images,and each customer can have their own image preferences (e.g. family vs. business customer). Displaying the best images for each hotel would have a significant impact on conversion. In this talk we will cover how Expedia has been ranking hotel images using deep learning techniques in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
