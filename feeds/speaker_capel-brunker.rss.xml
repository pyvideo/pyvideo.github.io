lead to; high code maintenance, legacy code and feature addition
fatigue. Implementing a well-documented and malleable software
architecture is a major step in addressing these associated time sinks.
This talk will discuss viable software architecture approaches – while
demonstrating core python modules, concepts and design patterns from a
big data perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many projects welcome code addition from third party developers, however
a well thought out software architecture should not be modified without;
review, testing, possible cascading code and documentation changes. To
remove the additional complexity of reviewing and handling third party
code, designing and offering secure plugin infrastructure can allow for
outside additions without the overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big data visualisation python project utilised by Oxford and Cambridge
universities will be used in code demonstrations to show the direct use
of a project built with architecture design in mind, and a multi-level
dynamic plugin infrastructure. Attendees will be provided with a clear
understanding of how function documentation techniques (PEP-3107 &amp;amp;
PEP-0484) can be utilised for class clarity and how to (re)design a code
base to allow for integration of third party code, while providing a
concise framework for code inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Areas covered in this talk include&lt;/p&gt;
