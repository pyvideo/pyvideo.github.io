arts, from the origins of punch cards to borrowed terminology and shared
cultural mores. Computing drew a surprising amount from fiber arts, and
as I began programming and knitting around the same time I was
fascinated to consider things such as how knitting patterns can be
viewed with the same conceptual framework as programs, and that
understanding how to modify one can provide interesting insights to the
other. Both the Python and textile communities are also wonderfully
diverse and put some very important efforts in place to encourage
inclusivity, which has helped lead me to feel comfortable sharing these
insights with such a large audience. This talk aims to get people
thinking a bit outside the box and understanding connections with
communities they might not have interacted with before.&lt;/p&gt;
