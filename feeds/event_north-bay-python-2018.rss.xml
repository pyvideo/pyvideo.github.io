safeguard for protecting accounts, but do you really know how it works?
This talk will show you how to implement One Time Passwords (including
what's happening under the hood of those expiring tokens). You'll learn
the different approaches to implementing 2FA and have a better
understanding of what's right for your application.&lt;/p&gt;

Even for
very experienced developers, even if we've seen it all before, even on
the fifth time we've written an essentially identical function, our code
still has bugs. In this talk we'll look at a library that can
automatically uncover these bugs, and learn how to apply it to
real-world codebases to find and mediate these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

you can do today to make sure your projects work well for ALL Python
users, no matter where they work.&lt;/p&gt;

standard Python library.&lt;/p&gt;

Why not use both? By
being language agnostic, you now have access to two great open source
languages. This makes it easier to find and use already built
modules/packages, which improves the speed, quality, and impact of your
results.&lt;/p&gt;

side channel attacks. You’ll be amused to see how features like
automatic data compression, short-circuit execution, and deterministic
hashing can be abused to bypass security systems. No security background
knowledge is required. The talk assumes at least intermediate Python
experience.&lt;/p&gt;

States have some kind of disability, and not including them limits your
reach. But once you've heard about the basics, how do you get started?
In this talk, I'll walk you through the process of finding issues in
your site, and discuss processes to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

There
is a catch: your favorite pizzeria doesn’t have a button-to-order app,
its website is client-side rendered and doesn’t have a public developer
API. We’ll learn two ways to still get you that pizza, compare them and
learn when to use which.&lt;/p&gt;

required in making a well-behaved Python class. We'll first see how to
make classes with proper string representations, comparability,
iterability, and immutability. Then we'll dive into helper tools
built-in to the standard library and available in third-party libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

drama (el drama es real) and complicated twists and turns. In this talk,
we'll look at some of the most popular telenovelas in recent years to
devise a common arch for a telenovela. Using this formula, we'll
determine if a recurring neural network is able to successfully produce
a telenovela script. If so, what would a telenovela&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of having an
edit-debug cycle, we can iterativey build up code snippets with
confidence, seeing how they process their inputs. Jupyter lets us refine
ideas in real time, integrating testing with development.
Exploration-oriented programming is developing inside an interactive
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

Warehouse (the new PyPI). The talk will also discuss some best practices

recursion has an intimidating reputation. But the underlying ideas
behind it are simple. This tutorial presents a quick intro of recursive
code, Python's features for handling recursion, and drawing fractals
with the turtle module. If you've ever thought &amp;quot;recursion is confusing&amp;quot;,
this tutorial is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

deeply unethical behavior played a huge role in the downfall of this
amazing park. This talk will explore the relationship between
engineering ethics, chaos, and building resilient systems. Expect to
laugh, cry, and learn to build a better park.&lt;/p&gt;

This
was the culmination of years of discussion about the scope of the
version, and what we were willing to break. An advantage we had in PHP
was that Python had gone through a similar process with Python 3 seven
years earlier. I'll discuss the lessons we took from the Python 2-3
transition, and how we used them.&lt;/p&gt;
