Murphy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of everything we do is the same – how can we produce something
useful for the citizens of Texas that enable them to be better
participants in their state government?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our News Apps team is responsible for the building and maintaining of
editorial-focused data explorers. Django's ease of use has made it
possible for us to architect both robust back-end systems for managing
the government data sets that power these apps, and to build compelling
interfaces to the data for our users to find their own stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details on the three projects we'd discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government Salaries Explorer is our most popular explorer. This
project manages the payroll data we've collected of more than 300
thousand public employees, providing a peak behind the curtains into how
tax dollars are being spent. It required a system that could standardize
the many different formats a public agency may release its payroll
information to us, but also remain easy to use for all members of the
team so updates happen in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Legislative Guide was our spin on a legislative bill tracker.
Instead of placing all the focus on the bills themselves, we instead
created a platform for our reporters to provide context on the many
topics and issues that come up during a legislative session. While we
still have the capacity for users to search for bills, the site's bigger
focus is on the potential changes this session's legislation may have on
the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, our upcoming revamp of our Public Schools Explorer will be
a Django app. This project is currently in it's very early stages, but
it's on track to be released by DjangoCon so there will be plenty to
show by then! The challenge – how can we take Texas Education Agency
data and turn it into something usable for the citizens – and parents –
of Texas? We are building an interface that makes it easy to compare and
districts and campuses to one another, opening up state data that has
always been public but frustratingly trapped within complicated web
forms and paper printouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this proposal is more focused on &amp;quot;what we did with Django&amp;quot; vs.
&amp;quot;how we did it&amp;quot; – although that will be touched on as well – I believe
the work we've produced is a testament to the impact we've been able to
have on the state and its citizens thanks to the support of a system
that works well for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help us caption &amp;amp; translate this video!&lt;/p&gt;
