&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in 2000km2 worth of Bornean Jungle there are 6 orangutans that need to be found and tracked. All you have is a short radio ping against a noisy background resulting in a unique and interesting anomaly detection problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borneo and Sumatra in South East Asia are home to a number of orangutan rescue and rehabilitation centres. A common problem each of these have is keeping track of the animals they release back in the wild. Traditionally this is done with ground teams using a radio antenna to search for the weak radio pings each animal sends out. A true needle in the haystack problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss a drone-based tracking system that is being developed to alleviate this problem. More specifically the data analysis problem of searching and locating the signal of each animal against a noisy background.&lt;/p&gt;
