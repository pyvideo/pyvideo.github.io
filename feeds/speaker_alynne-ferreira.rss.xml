become a global phenomenon, full of complex movements, creativity and
social connections. Graphs are powerful tools for analyzing and
visualizing interconnected networks. To organize a choreography using
graphs, you first need to create a directed graph that represents the
sequence of movements in the choreography. Each node will have a picture
that represents a specific pose, and each edge represents the connection
between the poses. The sequence used to change from one pose to the next
will represent the movement. Graphs can be used to facilitate the
creation of a choreography, allowing you to visualize the sequence of
movements and the relationship between them. At the end of this lecture,
we hope to put together a choreography based on the poses presented. The
order of the poses can be chosen manually or generated at random.&lt;/p&gt;
