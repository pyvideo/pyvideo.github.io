We
built-out some substantial infrastructure, coding primarily in Scala,
and using JVM-stack libraries. In the past year, we've moved beyond our
data business into building predictive analytics applications for Sales
and Marketing teams, so it was necessary to build a data science/machine
learning stack. While there's plenty of machine-learning tools for the
JVM, we felt that the Python ecosystem had many advantages for our
use-case (which we'll discuss), and we think we integrated them in a
clever way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a data scientist and software engineer. Languages of choice are
Scala and Python. I have been working with AWS for production for over
three years. My interest is in building data analytics applications with
cloud computing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
