&lt;p&gt;When web applications are created with development frameworks, UI element id tags are also generated. Id tags are widely considered the best way to refer to element but these new tags do not show purpose of the element. Because tags are generated, they can change without warning. That can ruin test automation business case due to laborious maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show how to write understandable and maintainable test automation scripts by finding elements based on their labels or captions. I will also tell how web applications UI should be designed to support this method.&lt;/p&gt;
