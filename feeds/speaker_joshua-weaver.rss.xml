Then we’ll discuss some of the lessons we learned and what we might do differently next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that those that attend this talk would walk away feeling inspired to try things that leverage the strengths of your team and the best features of the technologies in your toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
