In this session, we will explore RAPIDS, the open source data science
platform from NVIDIA. Come learn how to get started leveraging these
open-source libraries for faster performance and easier development on
GPUs. See the latest engineering work and new release features,
including benchmarks and software development roadmap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries gives the data
scientist the freedom to execute end-to-end data science and analytics
pipelines on GPUs. RAPIDS is incubatedby NVIDIA based on years of
accelerated analytics experience. RAPIDS relies on NVIDIA CUDA
primitives for low-level compute optimization and exposes GPU
parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python
interfaces. Through a familiar DataFrame API that integrates with a
variety of machine learning algorithms, RAPIDS facilitates common data
preparations tasks while removing typical serialization costs. RAPIDS
includes support for multi-GPU deployments, enabling vastly accelerated
processing and training on large dataset sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join NVIDIAâ€™s engineers as they walk through a collection of data
science problems that introduce components and features of RAPIDS,
including: feature engineering, data manipulation, statistical tasks,
machine learning, and graph analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
