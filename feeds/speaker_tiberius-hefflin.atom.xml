&lt;p&gt;Digital forensics would be a whole different ballgame without Python - the basis for most of the tools used. But what do these tools do, and why are they so important? This talk looks to teach a little about digital forensics, and then use that as a springboard to discuss the importance of Python in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

Virus? There’s an app for that. Malware? There’s an app for that. Social engineering? It's a little more complicated. These techniques, used by hackers to gather information on their target, are hard to combat without education - so why don’t we talk about them more often? Aimed at the average user who could be targeted by such an attack, this talk discusses the tools of social engineering, how it can be combated and why so many companies fail in preparing their employees for such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abusive behavior can have profound effects on personal relationships but it can also make open source contributing and office life miserable. For those stuck in a team with co workers who exhibit toxic behavior, going to work every day can feel like going to a battlefield. Knowing how to identify and how to respond to unreasonable behavior is vital. In this talk we will look at the ways we can improve our office and FOSS communities by recognizing, managing and gracefully removing this toxic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What abuse looks like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How it affects those around it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps to take if you are the target of abusive behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to manage toxic people in your project&lt;/p&gt;
