The system was built using various Python modules, more specifically scikit-learn, pyaudio, librosa, phue and bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author trained a machine learning model to detect in real-time that a goal was just scored by the Habs based on the live audio feed of a game and to trigger a light show using Philips hues in his living room. The system was built using various Python modules, more specifically scikit-learn, pyaudio, librosa, phue and bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover every step of the hack from the creation of the dataset, the feature generation and the machine learning model training, the real-time audio feed processing to do real-time scoring and the programming of the light show.&lt;/p&gt;
