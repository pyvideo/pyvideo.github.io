The data is then fed to the network for classification. In this talk, we will discuss an example where we will solve a CNN after preparing the data using appropriate computer vision and image processing algorithms using modules such as numpy, scipy, OpenCV etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning solves some of the most complex problems in computer vision. Deep learning is primarily a data problem (i.e.,) the more data we can provide to the learning algorithm, the better would be the outcome. In that regards, data preparation is a pre-requisite for solving deep learning problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is one of the most popular language for solving these deep learning problems. Python libraries such as Tensorflow, Theanos, Keras have made programming deep learning relatively easy. However, we still need to perform image augmentation and image preparation before feeding the data to deep learning. In this talk, we will learn about preparing large dataset of images for solving Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will read images using OpenCV and store them as numpy arrays. We will then filter and pre-process the images using scipy and OpenCV, so that the resulting tensor can be fed to the CNN. Along the way, we will discuss the philosophy behind each of these modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use Anaconda Python distribution along with the latest version of Tensorflow for this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Image acquisition and processing have become a standard method for qualifying and quantifying experimental measurements in many fields of science and engineering. Python offers the following advantage: simpler syntax, powerful libraries and modules that focuses on increasing the productivity and most importantly it is free and open-source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will learn image processing through a simple and common workflow. We will read a high-resolution image of a mice. We will filter the image to reduce noise and improve the quality of the image. We will then segment the image, so that we obtain only the bones. We will clean up the over-segmented regions using morphological operations. We will perform measurements on the segmented image. Finally, we will discuss the workflow with a Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;
