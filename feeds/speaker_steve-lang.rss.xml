This talk is specifically about how Python based analytics can be
integrated operationally into an organization at two levels: in ad hoc
investigations and in production analytic services. This is about best
practices in documented, reproducible and archived data investigations
as well as production development with Python. A case study of an
analytic service for cheating detection in Call of Duty Ghosts will make
this real and provide some fun. This talk is rated PG-13 for some
awesome video game violence.&lt;/p&gt;
