&lt;p&gt;[Liffey B on 2022-07-14]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about all the mistakes that I made while building a library, how I would have avoided making them if I started today, what turns I would have taken differently, what choices I made, and why I made them. Examples are drawn from the building of a specific library, but it's not about a specific one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim is to give some insights more into how to make choices when building a library available to the world, and less on the specific set of choices that I made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will not be technically challenging, but some familiarity with the Python ecosystem is advised.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
