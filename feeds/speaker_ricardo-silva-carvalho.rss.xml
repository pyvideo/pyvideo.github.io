&lt;p&gt;We propose a new method that satisfies approximate differential privacy for top-$k$ selection with unordered output in the unknown data domain setting, not relying on the full knowledge of the domain universe. Our algorithm only requires looking at the top-$bar{k}$ elements for any given $bar{k} geq k$, thus, enforcing the principle of minimal privilege. Unlike previous methods, our privacy parameter $varepsilon$ does not scale with $k$, giving improved applicability for scenarios of very large $k$. Moreover, our novel construction, which combines the sparse vector technique and stability efficiently, can be applied as a general framework to any type of query, thus being of independent interest. We extensively compare our algorithm to previous work of top-$k$ selection on the unknown domain, and show, both analytically and on experiments, settings where we outperform the current state-of-the-art.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
