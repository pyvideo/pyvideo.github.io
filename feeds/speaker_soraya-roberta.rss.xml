&lt;p&gt;CompiledPoem.py: Teaching about diversity and Python through poem by Soraya Roberta&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/compiledpoem-py-teaching-about-diversity-and-python-through-poem"&gt;https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/compiledpoem-py-teaching-about-diversity-and-python-through-poem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching how to program in Python has various approaches, but it becomes motivating when we work with concepts about diversity through poems. This talk will show how a project that aims to teach Python using poems and that grew hand in hand with the Python community has been changing the lives of children and, currently, teachers in a country in the global south. In order to demonstrate it, I will teach you how to create function blocks, conditional and looping structures in an easy and empowering way, while discussing topics such as racism, xenophobia, homophobia, and sexism, for example, through Python code integrated with poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
