At Meta, we began leveraging this functionality to power interactive test sessions that allow software engineers to quickly iterate on their projects without waiting for slow restart times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the base autoreload algorithm suffers from a number of reliability issues and can easily crash, thereby necessitating a costly restart. In this presentation, we’ll describe references reload, which is our new and improved autoreload algorithm with a number of benefits over the basic autoreload functionality. We’ll show how we use references reload in production to save developers hours of time, and we’ll close with a concrete use case for development on top of Bento server, which is Meta’s internal version of the Jupyter notebook server.&lt;/p&gt;
