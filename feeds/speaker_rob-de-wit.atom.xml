good reason. But while they're great for prototyping in data science
projects, they are not ideal for experimenting with different
configurations. I have been guilty of running experiments with changing
parameters while keeping track on a notepad, and the result has always
been messy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will explore how we can transform our notebook
prototype into a reproducible pipeline. We will discuss what goes wrong
without proper experiment tracking, why reproducibility is the key to
solving this, and how we can achieve that with Git and DVC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will discuss this topic using a text2image project with Stable
Diffusion. I'll show how to break up a notebook into modules, create a
pipeline from them, run experiments through the pipeline, and compare
their results to find the best possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target audience will be data scientists that don't have a strong
engineering background but would like to move beyond messing about in
notebooks. Much like myself a year or two ago.&lt;/p&gt;
