different languages. This sounds ideal since it should allow us to
choose the best mix of languages for the task at hand. Due to technical
hurdles however, language compositions tend to be little more than
simple foreign function interfaces (FFIs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At King's college London we are trying to build better language
compositions. We have devised a new approach which makes it much easier
to intermingle programming languages without compromising performance.
In this talk I will outline our approach and show what happens when you
put Python and PHP in a blender.&lt;/p&gt;
