We're
excited because we can show a neural network every galaxy in the sky and
ask questions, and afraid because we don't understand the answers. I'll
talk about how you can investigate galaxy evolution with TensorFlow and
crowdsourced labels, what we're discovering, and where it all falls
apart.&lt;/p&gt;
