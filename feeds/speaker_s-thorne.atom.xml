&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twisted is one of the best asynchronous network programming frameworks
out there, and can help you build cool stuff very easily, once you
understand the core design. Unfortunately, Twisted is also a huge
framework and can be very daunting for beginners to approach. This
training session aims to help people with little or no asynchronous
programming experience understand both Twisted and asynchronous
programming. The plan is to cover core asynchronous topics, the Twisted
way, and as many practical applications as we can cover, including web
services, IPC, GUI applications etc. The audience should be competent in
core Python constructs. No previous asynchronous or threading
programming experience required. This is a repeat of the popular
EuroPython 2011 Twisted Tutorial, improved after feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
