&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what technologies are used in a systematic
trading system that utilises computer models and accounts for the
majority of trading on the stock market? This is a look behind the
scenes at Winton Capital Management- one of Europe’s most successful
systematic investment managers. In this talk, we’ll run through an
overview of Winton’s trading infrastructure, including data
management, signal generation and execution of orders on global
exchanges. The talk will mainly focus on how Python gives researchers
fine-grained control over the data and trading systems, without
requiring them to interact directly with the underlying, highly-
optimised technology.&lt;/p&gt;
