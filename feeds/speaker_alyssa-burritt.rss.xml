Capturing this motion using a high-speed camera system creates many unique challenges in processing, analyzing, and visualizing the thousands of data points that are generated. These spatial coordinates can be quickly translated through Python scripts to well-known, industry-specific performance metrics and graphics in Shiny. Down the line, R utilities aid more complicated analyses and optimizations, driving new product innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover our company's process of implementing these tools into our workflow and highlight key program features that have helped successfully combine these applications for users with a variety of technical backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
