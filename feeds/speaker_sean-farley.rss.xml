See pybay.com for more details about PyBay and click SHOW MORE for more information about this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description
This workshop will have four or so Lego Mindstorms that we'll use to learn how to program a Mindstorm to use its camera to follow a racetrack made out of tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Using a real-time OS, we will learn about computer vision using the tools made by Lego. Time permitting, we will then remove parts of the racetrack and use machine learning to improve our race car.&lt;/p&gt;
