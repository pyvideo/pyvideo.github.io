thanks to PyScript. It is now possible to write websites, apps, and
games running entirely on the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Tutorial is an introduction to PyScript and will walk you through
learning about basic concepts, how to set up your project and create
amazing applications. More specifically: - Create your project
configuration - Define a python environment with all the dependencies to
run your code - Loading and manipulating with user data - Writing your
python code - Accessing the DOM and other browser features - Using
Javascript libraries from your Python application - Optimizing your
application - Look at what’s different between “standard” python vs.
Python on the browser - Have a lot of fun and hack together on your
ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
