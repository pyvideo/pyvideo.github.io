It offers a dataframe-like interface to construct concise and composable queries and then executes them against a wide variety of backends (Postgres, DuckDB, Spark, Snowflake, BigQuery, you name it.).&lt;/p&gt;

Python for analyzing it. However, as data size scales, analysis using
pandas may become untenable. Luckily, modern analytical databases (like
DuckDB) are able to analyze this same tabular data, but perform
orders-of-magnitude faster than pandas, all while using less memory.
Many of these systems only provide a SQL interface though; something far
different from pandas’ dataframe interface, requiring a rewrite of your
analysis code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Ibis comes in. Ibis provides a common dataframe interface
to many popular databases and analytics tools (BigQuery, Snowflake,
Spark, DuckDB, …). This lets users analyze data using the same
consistent API, regardless of which backend they’re using, and without
ever having to learn SQL (but you can use SQL if you want to!). No more
pains rewriting pandas code to something else when you run into
performance issues; write your code once using Ibis and run it on any
supported backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we’ll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The basic operations of Ibis (&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;select&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;filter&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;group_by&lt;/tt&gt;,
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;order_by&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;join&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;aggregate&lt;/tt&gt;), and how these operations
may be composed to form more complicated queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Ibis may be used on a number of different local and remote
backend engines to execute the same queries on different systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tradeoffs of different database engines, and recommendations for
how to choose the best tool for the job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Ibis integrates into the larger Python data ecosystem, including
tools like Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, PyArrow, pandas, Altair, and
VegaFusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hands-on tutorial, with numerous examples to get your hands
dirty. Participants should ideally have some experience using Python and
pandas, but no SQL experience is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will lay out the current database / data landscape as it relates to the SciPy stack, and explore how Ibis (an open-source, pure Python, dataframe interface library) can help decouple interfaces from engines, to improve both performance and portability. We'll examine other solutions for interacting with SQL from Python and discuss some of their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
