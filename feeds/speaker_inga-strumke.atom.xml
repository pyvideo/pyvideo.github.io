&lt;p&gt;Inga is going to share her most serious as well as most recent thoughts
on AI in today’s world and the future, including why we will probably
not have the privilege to worry about AGI in the near future, how to
achieve world domination using data like the Medici family used numbers,
why we should be inspired by containers in the shipping industry, and
how to code our way to tomorrow’s ethics - assuming that the world is a
closed system. This is a talk to be inspired and discuss!&lt;/p&gt;
