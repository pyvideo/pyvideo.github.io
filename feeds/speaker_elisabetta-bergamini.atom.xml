choosing which hotel to stay in. But can we actually trust a hotel
review? And if yes, how can we select which are the most meaningful and
interesting for us among the billions available in platforms such as
Booking.com, Tripadvisor, Facebook (just to mention a few)? For 10 years
now, at TrustYou we have built processes that analyze terabytes of hotel
reviews at a global scale, and strive to understand what people complain
about or like in the hotels worldwide. Dealing with a huge amount of
reviews written in tens of different languages - each having its own
subtle shades of meanings - is the challenge we work on everyday. In
this talk, we will show what goes on behind the scenes of the TrustYou
Metareview and dive into the technologies and the algorithms that allow
us to provide travellers with all the information they need to find the
perfect hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
