In the world of Netflix, this means recommending similar movies to the ones you have seen. In the world of dating, this means suggesting matches similar to people you already showed interest in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My path to recommenders has been an unusual one: from a Software Engineer to working on matching algorithms at a dating company, with a little background on machine learning. With my knowledge of Python and the use of basic SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) frameworks, I was able to understand SVDs from a practical standpoint of what you can do with them, instead of focusing on the science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk, you will learn 2 practical ways of generating recommendations using SVDs: matrix factorization and item similarity. We will be learning the high-level components of SVD the &amp;quot;doer way&amp;quot;: we will be implementing a simple movie recommendation engine with the help of Jupiter notebooks, the MovieLens database, and the Surprise recommendation package.&lt;/p&gt;

On top of the general design, there are many code quality aspects that you need to watch out for when writing and reviewing code such as adherence to PEP8, docstring quality, test quality, etc. Furthermore, everyone is human. If you are catching these code quality issues by hand, there is a good chance that at some point you will miss an easy opportunity to improve code quality. If the quality check can be done by a machine, then why would you even try to catch the code quality issue by hand? In the end, the machine will be able to perform the quality check with much more speed, accuracy, and consistency than a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will dive into how existing open source projects offload and automate many of these code quality checks resulting in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A higher quality and a more consistent codebase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintainers being able to focus more on the higher level design and interfaces of a project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improved contribution process and higher quality pull requests from external contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By diving into how these open source projects automate code quality checks, you will learn about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The available tooling related to checking code quality such as &lt;cite&gt;flake8&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;pylint&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;coverage&lt;/cite&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to automate code quality checks for both a development and team setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-hand accounts of the benefits and lessons learned from automating code quality checks in real-life open source projects.&lt;/li&gt;

I will introduce probabilistic models, which use Bayesian statistical methods to quantify all aspects of uncertainty relevant to your problem, and provide inferences in simple, interpretable terms using probabilities.  A particularly flexible form of probabilistic models uses Bayesian &lt;em&gt;non-parametric&lt;/em&gt; methods, which allow models to vary in complexity depending on how much data are available. In doing so, they avoid the over-fitting that is common in machine learning and statistical modeling. I will demonstrate the basics of Bayesian non-parametric modeling in Python, using the PyMC3 package. Specifically, I will introduce two common types, Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, and show how they can be applied easily to real-world problems using two examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll teach you what you need to know about Big-O, and how to use it to keep your programs running well.  Big-O helps you choose the data structures and algorithms that will let your code work efficiently even on large data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can understand Big-O even if you aren't a theoretical computer science math nerd. Big-O isn't as mystical as it appears. It's wrapped in mathematical trappings, but doesn't have to be more than a common-sense assessment of how your code will behave.&lt;/p&gt;

Companies like Dropbox and Facebook, and open-source projects like Zulip, use static types (with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/"&gt;PEP 484&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/mypy"&gt;mypy&lt;/a&gt;) to make Python more productive and fun to work with — in existing codebases from 40k lines to 4 million, in Python 2 and 3, and while preserving the conciseness and flexibility that make Python a great language in the first place. I’ll describe how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading and understanding code is a huge part of what we do as software developers. If we make it easier to understand our codebases, we make everyone more productive, help each other write fewer bugs, and lower barriers for new contributors. That's why Python now features optional static types, and why Dropbox, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://engineering.instagram.com/let-your-code-type-hint-itself-introducing-open-source-monkeytype-a855c7284881"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blog.zulip.org/2016/10/13/static-types-in-python-oh-mypy/"&gt;Zulip&lt;/a&gt; use them on part or all of their Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll share lessons from Zulip’s and Dropbox’s experience — having led the mypy team at Dropbox and working now on the Zulip core team — for how you can start using static types in your own codebases, large or small. We’ll discuss how to make it a seamless part of your project’s tooling; what order to approach things in; and powerful new tools that make it even easier today to add static types to your Python codebase than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

Logs are the main way to know what is happening with an application at runtime, but we don’t realize how important they are until we actually need them. Unfortunately, they are usually an under-estimated part of the development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to transmit the need for the logging module, briefly explains how to use it and how it is built, and dives into all the complexity that is hidden to us. This will help attendees not just understand all the magic that allows us to inspect our applications at runtime, but also to avoid mistakes and adapt the module to our needs for more esoteric scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is structured to simplify the understanding of the logging module. Many people have read the documentation, but still struggle to fully understand what is happening under the hood. This talk aims to eliminate that barrier by presenting it in an easier-to-digest manner.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will discuss common ways that real-world systems store identity wrong, what questions you shouldn't ask, and how you can fix it in your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2001, I wrote Python versions of these tools which can be found in the PLY project.  PLY predates a huge number of modern Python features including the iteration protocol, generators, decorators, metaclasses, and more.  As such, it relied on a variety of clever hacks to layer a domain specific parser specification language on top of Python itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I discuss a modernization of the PLY project that abandons its past and freely abuses modern Python features including advanced metaclasses, guaranteed dictionary ordering, class decorators, type hints, and more.   The result of this work can be found in the SLY project.  However, this talk isn't so much about SLY as it is focused on how far you can push Python metaprogramming features to create domain-specific languages.

However, when making charts, customarily we are just re-sizing lines and circles based on metrics instead of creating data-driven version of reality.  The contemporary charting techniques have a few shortcomings (especially when dealing with high-dimensional dataset):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;: in order to fit a high-dimensional dataset into a chart one needs to filter/ aggregate/ flatten data which results in reduction of full context of information.  Without context most of the charts show only a part of the story, that can potentially lead to data misinterpretation/misunderstanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numeric Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;: naturally humans have hard time perceiving big numbers. While data visualization is suppose to help us to conceptualize large volumes,  unless the dataset is carefully prepared, 2D charts rarely give us the intuitive grasp of magnitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perceptual de-humanization&lt;/strong&gt;: when examining charts it is easy to forget that we are dealing with activity in real world instead of lines/bars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augmented/Mixed Reality can potentially solve all of the issues listed above by presenting an intuitive and interactive environment for data exploration. Three dimensional space provides conditions to create complex data stories with more “realistic assets” (beyond lines and bars). The talk would present the architecture required to create MR data visualization story with Python (70% of architecture), starting with drawing 3D assets in a data-driven way and finishing with deployment on MR devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dataclasses are shown to be the next step in a progression of data aggregation tools: tuple, dict, simple class, bunch recipe, named tuples, records, attrs, and then dataclasses. Each builds upon the one that came before, adding expressiveness at the expense of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dataclasses are unique in that they let you selectively turn-on or turn-off its various capabilities and it lets the user choose the underlying data store (either instance dictionary, instance slots, or an inherited base class).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dataclasses and typing.NamedTuple both use variable annotations which were new in Python 3.6.&lt;/p&gt;

We use this in practice to serve a broad community of atmospheric and climate scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric and climate scientists analyze large volumes of observational and simulated data to better understand our planet.  They have historically used tools like NumPy and SciPy along with Jupyter notebooks to combine efficient computation with accessibility.  However, as datasets increase in size and collaboration extends to new populations of scientists these tools begin to feel their age.  In this talk we use more recent libraries to build a modern deployment for academic scientists.  In particular we use the following tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dask:&lt;/strong&gt; to parallelize and scale NumPy computations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XArray&lt;/strong&gt;: as a self-discribing data model and tool kit for labeled and index arrays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JupyterLab:&lt;/strong&gt; to enable more APIs for users beyond the classic notebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JupyterHub:&lt;/strong&gt; to manage users and maintain environments for a new population of cloud-friendly users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes:&lt;/strong&gt; to manage everything and deploy easily on cloud hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus less on how these libraries work and will instead be a case study of using them together in an operational setting.  During the talk we will build up and deploy a running system that the audience can then use to access distributed computing resources.&lt;/p&gt;

Think test data files, certificates, templates, translation catalogs, and other static files you want to access from Python code.  Sometimes you put these static files in a package directory within your source tree, and then locate them by importing the package and using its &lt;cite&gt;__file__&lt;/cite&gt; attribute.  But this doesn't work for zip files!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could use &lt;cite&gt;pkg_resources&lt;/cite&gt;, an API that comes with &lt;cite&gt;setuptools&lt;/cite&gt; and hides the differences between files on the file system and files in a zip file.  This is great because you don't have to use &lt;cite&gt;__file__&lt;/cite&gt;, but it's not so great because &lt;cite&gt;pkg_resources&lt;/cite&gt; is a big library and can have potentially severe performance problems, even at import time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;cite&gt;importlib.resources&lt;/cite&gt;, a new module and API in Python 3.7 that is also available as a standalone library for older versions of Python.  &lt;cite&gt;importlib.resources&lt;/cite&gt; is build on top of Python's existing import system, so it is very efficient.  It also defines an abstract base class which loaders can implement to provide their own resource access.  Python's built-in zipimporter uses this to provide efficient access to resources within a zip file.  Third party import hooks can do the same, so resources can come from anything that is importable by Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will step through the motivations behind &lt;cite&gt;importlib.resources&lt;/cite&gt;, the library's usage, its interfaces, and the hooks made available to third party packages.  It will also talk about the minor differences between the standalone version and the version in Python 3.7's standard library.  Hopefully audience members will come away with compelling reasons to port their code to this much more efficient library.&lt;/p&gt;

Netflix must stream uninterrupted in the face of widespread network issues, bad code deploys, AWS service outages, and much more. Failovers make this possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failover is the process of transferring all of our traffic from one region in AWS to another. While most of Netflix runs on Java, failovers are powered entirely by Python. Python's versatility and rich ecosystem means we can use it for everything from predicting our traffic patterns to orchestrating traffic movement, while dealing with the eventual consistency of AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we can shift all of our 100 million+ users in under seven minutes. A lot of engineering work went into making this possible. The issues we faced and solutions we created have broad application to availability strategies in the cloud or the datacenter.&lt;/p&gt;

But should your &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; care?  Should it need to know whether it’s running on your notebook, on a server, in a Docker container, or in some cloud platform as a service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should not, because environment-agnostic applications are easier to &lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt;, easier to &lt;strong&gt;deploy&lt;/strong&gt;, easier to &lt;strong&gt;handle&lt;/strong&gt;, and easier to &lt;strong&gt;scale&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can you &lt;em&gt;practically&lt;/em&gt; structure and configure your applications to make them indifferent to the environment they run in?  How do secrets fit into the picture?  And where do you put that log file?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this talk you’ll know the tools and techniques that enable you to write such Python applications and you’ll be ready for the next big change.&lt;/p&gt;

Some traits come more easily to mind than others when it comes to identifying a great developer. In this talk we will take a slightly different approach to evaluating software development best practices, and identify one underrated skill common to great software developers: empathy. I hope to demonstrate that cognitive and emotional empathy skills are critical to good software development. We will explore ways to cultivate this trait in order to become better developers, both for our own sakes and for the sake of the teams in which we work.&lt;/p&gt;

At Zymergen, we edit DNA to design microbes with improved ability to produce valuable materials and molecules. Microbes with these edits are built and tested in high throughput by our fleet of robots. Genomes are far too large for exhaustive search, so identifying which edits to make requires machine learning on non-standard features. Our task to extract information from trees, networks, and graphs of independently representable knowledge bases (metabolism, genomics, regulation), in ways that respect the strongly causal relationships between systems. In this talk, I will describe how we use Python’s biological packages (e.g. BioPython, CobraPy, Escher, goatools) and other packages (NetworkX, TensorFlow, PyStan, AirFlow) to extract machine learning features and predict which genetic edits will produce high-performance microbes.&lt;/p&gt;

Python 3 is the future and you'll need to consider both your upgrade plan and what steps you'll take after upgrading to start leveraging Python 3 features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk we'll briefly discuss how to start &lt;strong&gt;the process of upgrading your code to Python 3&lt;/strong&gt;. We'll then dive into some of &lt;strong&gt;the most useful Python 3 features&lt;/strong&gt; that you'll be able to start embracing once you drop Python 2 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of the most powerful Python 3 features are syntactic features that are &lt;strong&gt;Python 3 only&lt;/strong&gt;. You won't get any experience using these features until you fully upgrade. These features are an incentive to drop Python 2 support in existing 2 and 3 compatible code. You can consider this talk as a teaser of Python 3 features that you may have never used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this talk I hope you'll be inspired to fully upgrade your code to Python 3.&lt;/p&gt;

data with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/profile.html"&gt;profiling&lt;/a&gt;. Once we’ve identified the bottleneck we’ll need
to change our approach, but what options are faster than others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk illustrates a Python performance investigation and
improvements using an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adventofcode.com/"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt; programming challenge. I’ll walk
through starting from a slow (but correct) solution, look at profiling
data to investigate &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it’s slow, and explore multiple paths for
improving performance, including more efficient algorithms and using
third-party tools like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cython.org/"&gt;Cython&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll leave this talk with a recipe
for analyzing Python performance and information about some options for
improved performance.&lt;/p&gt;

For most purposes using the python math module to create random numbers within a specific range can be done with no further questions, but sometimes we require a more nuanced implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will look at both pseudo-random number generators, which use statistically repeatable processes to generate seemingly random series and true random number generators, which inject physical processes like atmospheric noise to generate sequences of numbers. We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both approaches and common methods of implementing these two types of generators in python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will look at several real applications for randomness and discuss the best method for generating “randomness” in each scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

Measured in Internet time, it is ancient. The oldest main stream implementation of the WSGI specification is mod_wsgi, for the Apache HTTPD server and it is over 10 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WSGI is starting to be regarded as not up to the job, with technologies such as HTTP/2, web sockets and async dispatching being the way forward. Reality is that WSGI will be around for quite some time yet and for the majority of use cases is more than adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real problem is not that we need to move to these new technologies, but that we aren't using the current WSGI servers to their best advantage. Moving to a new set of technologies will not necessarily make things better and will only create a new set of problems you have to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the oldest WSGI server implementations, Apache and mod_wsgi may be regarded as boring and not cool, but it is still the most stable option for hosting WSGI applications available. It also hasn't been sitting still, with a considerable amount of development work being done on mod_wsgi in the last few years to make it even more robust and easier to use in a development environment as well as production, including in containerised environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk you will learn about many features of mod_wsgi which you probably didn't even know existed, features which can help towards ensuring your Python web application deployment performs to its best, is secure, and has a low maintenance burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics which will be covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy deployment of Python web applications using mod_wsgi-express.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration of mod_wsgi-express with a Django web application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using mod_wsgi-express in a development environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make use of mod_wsgi-express in a production environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using mod_wsgi-express in a containerised runtime environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring consistency between development and production environments using warpdrive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using mod_wsgi-express to bootstrap a system Apache installation for hosting WSGI applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why you should be using daemon mode of mod_wsgi and not embedded mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to properly associate mod_wsgi with a Python virtual environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a robust deployment that can recover from misbehaving application code, backend services, or request overloading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using hooks provided by mod_wsgi to monitor the performance of your Python web application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a beginner, come learn why mod_wsgi is still a good option for deploying your Python web applications. If you are an old time user of mod_wsgi, find out about all the features you probably didn't know existed, revisit your current Python web application deployment and make it even better.&lt;/p&gt;

Throughout elementary and middle school, I have been taught programming in many different ways. Then in late middle school, I taught programming to children at my local library. In this talk, I have compiled many teaching methods that I have found useful when learning python/teaching python. I also cover the ages to start coding, access to computers, and teaching at school vs. an after-school program. With the help of several coding teachers, school principals, and after-school coding program directors, I hope that this talk will serve as a guide to anyone who wants to teach python or find a good way to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

Systems hiccup and hours of downtime follows. Screws fall out all the time; the world is an imperfect place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talk a lot about building resilient systems, but all systems are (at least for now) built by humans. Humans who have been making the same types of mistakes for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because failure happens doesn’t mean we can’t do our best to prevent it or—at the very least—to minimize the damage when it does. As a matter of fact, embracing failure can be one of the best things you do for your system. Failure is a vital part of evolution. By learning to love failure we learn how to take the next step forward. Ignoring or punishing failure leads to stagnation and wasted potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk distills 3000 pages of failure research into 40 minutes of knowledge about the human factors of failure, how it can be recognised, and how you can work around it to create more resilient systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this talk the audience will have an awareness of the most common psychological reasons for mistakes and failures and how to develop systems and processes to protect against them.&lt;/p&gt;

For Python developers, diving into Spark is challenging, because it requires learning the Java infrastructure, memory management, configuration management. The multiple layers of indirection also make it harder to debug things, especially when throwing the Pyspark wrapper into the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Dask emerging as a pure Python framework for parallel computing, Python developers might be looking at it with new hope, wondering if it might work for them in place of Spark. In this talk, I’m using a data aggregation example to highlight the important differences between the two frameworks, and make it clear how involved the switch may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s probably nothing worse than that sinking feeling when you finish an analysis, email it to your manager or client to review, and they point out a mistake so basic you can’t even fathom how you missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about mine: how to take an average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averages are something we use everywhere - it’s a simple &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;np.mean()&lt;/tt&gt; in pandas or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;AVG()&lt;/tt&gt; in SQL. But recently I’ve come to appreciate just how easy it is to calculate this statistic incorrectly. We learn once - in middle school no less - how to take an average, and never revisit it. Then, when we are faced with multidimensional datasets (ie. pretty much every dataset out there), we never reconsider whether we should be taking an average the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we follow my arduous and humbling journey of learning how to properly take an average with multidimensional data. We will cover how improperly calculating it can produce grossly incorrect figures, which can slip into publications, research analyses and management reports.&lt;/p&gt;

In Python, &lt;strong&gt;behave&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the leading BDD test frameworks. Using &lt;strong&gt;behave&lt;/strong&gt;, teams write Gherkin behavior scenarios (e.g., tests) in plain language, and then programmers write Python code to automate the steps. BDD testing is great because tests are self-documenting and steps abide by the DRY principle. An example test could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the DuckDuckGo home page is displayed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the user searches the phrase &amp;quot;Python&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then search results for &amp;quot;Python&amp;quot; are shown&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will teach how to use &lt;strong&gt;behave&lt;/strong&gt; to develop well-designed test scenarios and a robust automation framework. It will focus on the layers of the behave framework: feature files, step definitions, support classes, and config files. A full example project will be hosted on GitHub for audience members to reference after the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

Property-based testing, provided by the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; library, lets you run hundreds of tests from a single template. Contracts, via &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deadpixi/contracts"&gt;dpcontracts&lt;/a&gt;, make your program test itself. You'll learn how and why to use these tools and how to combine them with the rest of your testing suite.&lt;/p&gt;

They encounter and solve problems at scales shared by few others, and as a result, their priorities in production engineering and architecture are just a bit different from the rest of us down here in the other 99% of services. Through deconstructing a few blog posts from these giants, we’ll evaluate just what is it that they’re thinking about when they build systems and whether any of their choices are relevant to those of us operating at high scale yet still something less than millions of requests per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will go into depth on how to make technological decisions to meet your customers’ requirements without requiring a small army of engineers to answer 2 AM pages, and how to set realistic goals for your team around operations, uptime, communications, and disaster recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these guidelines in mind, you should be better equipped to say no (or yes!) the next time your team’s software hipster proposes moving everything to the Next Big Thing.&lt;/p&gt;

And as anyone who as worked on a team knows, there’s often a lot more that goes into working together to build that product than actually just building the product itself. A highly functional team is not as elusive it may seem. Software engineering is a skill we’ve developed, but even more importantly software engineering on teams is another skill we’ve been practicing and improving on as an industry. Software engineering principles and best practices may seem to have very little to do with teamwork, but being able to thoughtfully apply some of what we’ve learned as engineers towards teamwork, we can help move towards creating such success with our teams.&lt;/p&gt;

In order to truly iterate and develop a codebase, one has to be able to confidently test during the development process and monitor the production system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I hope to address the key components for building out end to end testing for data pipelines by borrowing concepts from how we test python web services. Just like how we want to check for healthy status codes from our API responses, we want to be able to check that a pipeline is working as expected given the correct inputs. We’ll talk about key features that allows a data pipeline to be easily testable and how to identify timeseries metrics that can be used to monitor the health of a data pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only can they catch bugs and errors but they can contribute in positive ways to the individual developer, the team, management and company as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art critiques have existed in academia for hundreds of years. The methodology of the critique has evolved to be time sensitive and productive, while keeping the enthusiasm of the student artist intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the art critique is to get peers and mentors to look at the work and raise any problems they may see. It's also time where people with more experience could contribute their knowledge in a helpful way. This process is about producing the best work, quickly and in a productive and constructive way.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most transformational experiences I had while incarcerated was learning to code, through a pioneering new program called Code.7370 — the first coding curriculum in a United States prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’d like to share my experiences learning to code in prison and getting a software engineering job after my release, with the goals of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspiring new programmers to stick with it and be confident in their abilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspiring educators to think about how to support new coders in a broad range of learning environments (there’s no internet in prison!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspiring everyone to think about the potential for rehabilitation in prison in a new way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My story: My first computer was the Commodore 64. I can still remember writing in Basic when you had to number the lines of code yourself and save everything onto cassette drives. Once the Atari 2600 came on the scene, I traded in my keyboard for a joystick and lost myself in each successive release. From Intellivision to Colecovision and from Nintendo to Playstation, I immersed myself to test my skill and lose myself in these magical digital universes. As I left my teen years behind, I discovered new ways of exciting and losing myself in a sea of alcoholism and drug addiction. As Y2K came and went, American Online and Motorola flip phones were about the hottest thing going and I began dealing drugs to support my reckless lifestyle. This decision would lead me to taking a friend’s life over a six pound suitcase of marijuana. It was the worst decision I’ve ever made in my life and would cost me the next 17 years in prison. While I was in prison, I sat on the sidelines and watched as the world of technology was passing me by. I spent over a decade in prison with no access to computers, the internet, or email. The only glimmers I saw were from commercials on TV and my subscription to Wired magazine. That was until I was accepted to The Last Mile, an entrepreneurial program at San Quentin State Prison. We read books by authors like Guy Kawasaki, Reid Hoffman, and Andy Smith. We also learned to develop business plans for our own entrepreneurial ideas that involved 3 components, 1) something we were passionate about 2) something that involved technology 3) something with a social cause. My idea was for an online life coaching platform called Fitness Monkey that would empower addiction recovery through physical fitness. In 2014, the door to technology was finally opened. The Last Mile started the Code.7370 program where I was accepted and began learning front-end web development. With every line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I wrote, I fell in love with coding for its ability to solve problems and create and design solutions that could enhance people’s lives. I carried a coding book with me everywhere I went and my love for coding would propel me to the head of the class. I begin doing breakout sessions with my classmates on coding challenges assigned to us by Hack Reactor, a dev bootcamp in San Francisco. The first class was such a success, they started a Track 2 that taught advanced CSS and went into depth on data structures and algorithms. Later, we began delving into full-stack development with Angular, Node, and WordPress. With so many qualified inside coders, The Last Mile partnered with the Prison Industry Authority to open The Last Mile Works, a dev shop inside the walls of San Quentin. We began developing projects for outside companies like Airbnb and the Coalition for Public Safety. As well as, earning a wage that would provide us with a savings account upon our release to help transition back into society. I was building a resume and gaining real world experience while incarcerated that would enable me to find employment with The Last Mile upon my release. On May 4, 2017, I was released from prison after serving a total of 17 years. I did everything in my power to make sure that this time wasn’t wasted. I was hired for a paid internship with The Last Mile as a Web Developer to build a learning management system that would package the coding program at San Quentin into a piece of software that could be distributed to other prisons throughout California and eventually the entire country. This internship also included our application to Y-Combinator where we pitched our project to Michael Seibel, the CEO and his team of VC’s. We finished the project and it’s currently being tested in San Quentin and two different Women’s prisons. As my internship drew to an end, I began to reach out and see what other opportunities would be available to someone with my experience. I went through a 4 hour interview process with the entire engineering team at FANDOM. I’m not going to say it was as difficult as the parole board, but these guys put me through my paces and in the end offered my a 90 day internship. Here was my chance! When my internship began, I was given quite a few tasks that those in the industry call pixel pushing. Design tweaks and CSS fixes. All of the cards on the project management board were labeled 1-5 on complexity. For the first few weeks, all of my cards were ones. However, with each successive week, I became more familiar with the code base and started to reach for some of the more difficult assignments. I believe one of my strengths was being able to admit when I had no clue what I was doing and courage to ask for help. My time at FANDOM was an amazing experience in learning how to collaborate on an international team that spans eight different countries. I learned how to effectively communicate with different departments within the office in San Francisco. And, one of the most amazing parts was getting to tell my story to the entire company at the all hands meeting. Now, I was not only the ‘old’ intern, but someone who had persevered through adversity and was willing to share his truth of committing a horrible crime, but also of earning a college degree, running marathons, developing business ideas, and learning to code. All of the work paid off this past December, when I was offered a full-time position as a Software Engineer for FANDOM. One of my biggest fears was what would life be like for me once I was released from prison. The answer is nothing short of incredible. The Last Mile’s mantra is ‘Believe in the Process’ and there were times when I wasn’t even quite sure what the process was, but I believed anyway. For every step I took learning and growing, more and more opportunities opened up for me. I found great freedom in defaulting to yes.&lt;/p&gt;

Much of Apache Spark’s power comes from lazy evaluation along with intelligent pipelining, which can make debugging more challenging. This talk will examine how to debug Apache Spark applications, the different options for logging in PySpark, as well as some common errors and how to detect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spark’s own internal logging can often be quite verbose, and this talk will examine how to effectively search logs from Apache Spark to spot common problems. In addition to the internal logging, this talk will look at options for logging from within our program itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spark’s accumulators have gotten a bad rap because of how they interact in the event of cache misses or partial recomputes, but this talk will look at how to effectively use Spark’s current accumulators for debugging as well as a look to future for data property type accumulators which may be coming to Spark in future version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to reading logs, and instrumenting our program with accumulators, Spark’s UI can be of great help for quickly detecting certain types of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debuggers are a wonderful tool, however when you have 100 computers the “wonder” can be a bit more like “pain”. This talk will look at how to connect remote debuggers, but also remind you that it’s probably not the easiest path forward.&lt;/p&gt;

Tensorflow has its benefits like wide scale adoption, deployment on mobile, and support for distributed computing, but it also has a somewhat challenging learning curve, is difficult to debug, and hard to deploy in production. PyTorch is a new deep learning framework that solves a lot of those problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyTorch is only in beta, but users are rapidly adopting this modular deep learning framework. PyTorch supports tensor computation and dynamic computation graphs that allow you to change how the network behaves on the fly unlike static graphs that are used in frameworks such as Tensorflow. PyTorch offers modularity which enhances the ability to debug or see within the network and for many, is more intuitive to learn than Tensorflow.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet your project isn’t succeeding in the ways you want? Maybe you’re struggling with funding or documentation? Or you just can’t find new contributors and you’re drowning in issues and pull requests?
Open Source is made up of many components and we are often better-trained in methods for writing good code, than in methods for succeeding in the other dimensions we want our project to grow.
In this talk we’ll explore the different components of an Open Source project and how they work together. After this talk you’ll be well-equipped with a ideas and strategies for growing, cultivating, and nourishing your Open Source project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your project to succeed, all of its non-code components must be well-maintained. What are these different components and what methods can we learn to maintain them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build real relationships with your sponsors and determine ways how both sides can benefit from this relationship, don’t just ask people for money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a good communication system with your contributors: Keep them informed, listen to their feedback and input, make them feel heard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank the people who worked on ticket triage or marketing, not just those who wrote code, in your release notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it easy for new contributors to get started: Write and maintain good documentation, answer questions in a friendly and timely manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market and evangelize in the right places and at the right time: Give conference talks, organize sprints, keep your project’s Twitter account active, always curate new and interesting content on your blog or website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement a Code of Conduct and enforce it if needed: Make your project a safe space to contribute for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New conferences rarely have resources to run the sort of outreach and inclusion programs that big conferences have. It’s hard to guess how much money you’ll have to spend, how many attendees you’ll have, and what your new community will look like. With so many things to worry about, it’s no surprise that most events don’t prioritise outreach until they’ve got a few years under their belt, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be this way, and it can even be easier to build a new event around outreach and inclusion than it is to build it in later on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shares the story of North Bay Python’s inaugural conference, which we planned in under 6 months, ran on a $40,000 budget, and built a welcoming community to make it real. We made inclusivity a founding principle and did so without compromising our speaker lineup while still attracting great sponsorship and hosted an event that almost every attendee wants to return to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’re going to share with you how we built a conference, from the ground up, to be as inclusive as we could make it. We’ll touch on early organisation, marketing, and on-the ground logistics. Throughout the talk, you’ll learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we designed a budget that let us prioritise outreach and inclusion activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we built the community that we wanted before the conference even started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we ran an event that proved that we meant everything we said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You too can host a new conference with a great lineup on a shoestring budget and short timeline, and you can do it while being inclusive, welcoming, and putting attendee safety first. Find out how you can have your cake, eat it, and still have lots to share with your new community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be this way. Armed with some best practices and a little help

Your host sent instructions describing how to reach their office. Though the instructions were fairly clear, in a few places, such as at the end, you had to infer what to do. How does a &lt;em&gt;robot (agent)&lt;/em&gt; interpret an instruction in the environment to infer the correct course of action? Enabling harmonious &lt;em&gt;Human - Robot Interaction&lt;/em&gt; is of primary importance if they are to work seamlessly alongside people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dealing with natural language instructions in hard because of two main reasons, first being, Humans - through their prior experience know how to interpret natural language but agents can’t, and second is overcoming the ambiguity that is inherently associated with natural language instructions. This talk is about how deep learning models were used to solve such complex and ambiguous problem of converting natural language instruction into its corresponding action sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following verbal route instructions requires knowledge of language, space, action and perception. In this talk I shall be presenting, a neural sequence-to-sequence model for direction following, a task that is essential to realize effective autonomous agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a high level, a sequence-to- sequence model is an end-to-end model made up of two recurrent neural networks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encoder&lt;/strong&gt; - which takes the model’s input sequence as input and encodes it into a fixed-size context vector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt; - which uses the context vector from above as a seed from which to generate an output sequence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, sequence-to-sequence models are often referred to as &lt;em&gt;encoder-decoder&lt;/em&gt; models. The alignment based encoder-decoder model would translate the natural language instructions into corresponding action sequences. This model does not assume any prior linguistic knowledge: syntactic, semantic or lexical. The model learns the meaning of every word, including object names, verbs, spatial relations as well as syntax and the compositional semantics of the language on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, steps involved in pre-processing of data, training the model, testing the model and final simulation of the model in the virtual environment will be discussed. This talk will also cover some of the challenges and trade-offs made while designing the model.&lt;/p&gt;

But it also gives us an easy way to handle errors which is a hard task within asynchronous programming. ReactiveX makes our code more flexible, readable, maintainable and easy to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be exploring how ReactiveX help us to make things easier with its operators toolbox that can be used to filter, create, transform or unify any of those streams. We will learn that in just a few lines of maintainable code, we can have multiple web sockets which recieves multiple requests all handled by an asynchronous process that serves a filtered output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that I decided to explain an example of the use with an example by implementing observables, observers/subscribers and subjects. We will start by requesting our data stream from the Github API with a Tornado web socket and then filtering and processing it asynchrounosly.&lt;/p&gt;

Then I’ll show how this interface enabled us to construct our own meta-estimator for model stacking.

EDA and data visualization are the most crucial yet overlooked stage in analytics process. This is because they give insights on the most relevant features in a particular data set required to build an accurate model. It is often said that the more the data, the better the model but sometimes, this can be counter-productive as more data can be a disadvantage. EDA helps avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDA is useful for professionals while data visualization is useful for end-users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For end-users:
A good sketch is better than a long speech. The value of a machine learning model is not known unless it is used to make data driven decisions. It is therefore necessary for data scientists to master the act of telling a story for their work to stay relevant. This is where data visualization is extremely useful.
We must remember that the end-users of the results are not professionals like us but people who know little or nothing about data analysis. For effective communication of our analysis, there is need for a detailed yet simple data visualization because the work of a data scientist is not done if data-driven insights and decisions are not made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For professionals:
How do you ensure you are ready to use machine learning algorithms in a project? How do you choose the most suitable algorithms for your data set? How do you define the feature variables that can potentially be used for machine learning? Most data scientists ask these questions.  EDA answers these questions explicitly.
Also, EDA helps in understanding the data. Understanding the data brings familiarity with the data, giving insights on the best models that fit the data set, the features in the dataset that will be useful for building an accurate machine learning model, making feature engineering an easy process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will give a detailed explanation on what EDA and data visualization are and why they are very helpful in building accurate machine learning models for analytics as well as enhancing productivity and better understanding for clients. I will also discuss the risks of not mastering EDA and data visualization as a data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

pitfalls in other libraries, and taking advantage of new Python 3
features, I’ve come up with a new set of primitives that make it
dramatically easier to write correct concurrent programs, and
implemented them in a new library called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://trio.readthedocs.io"&gt;Trio&lt;/a&gt;. In this talk, I’ll
describe these primitives, and demonstrate how to use them to implement
a basic algorithm for speeding up TCP connections. Compared to the best
previous Python implementation, our version turns out to be easier to
understand, more correct, and dramatically shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk assumes basic familiarity with Python, but does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; require
any prior experience with concurrency, async/await, or networking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear the story of how we used Python to build an AI that plays Super
StreetFighter II on the Super NES. We’ll cover how Python provided the
key glue between the SNES emulator and AI, and how the AI was built with
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;gym&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;keras-rl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;tensorflow&lt;/tt&gt;. We’ll show examples of game
play and training, and talk about which bot beat which bot in the
bot-v-bot tournament we ran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this talk you’ll know how easy it is to use Python and Python’s
machine learning libraries to teach a computer to play games. You’ll see
a practical example of the same type of machine learning used by
AlphaGo, and also get to find out which character in StreetFighter II is
best to pick when playing your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

When paired with an IDE, testing gets a visual interface, making it much easier to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we cover “visual testing”: starting, learning, using, and mastering test-driven development (TDD) with the help of a nice UI. We’ll show PyCharm Community Edition, a free and open-source Python IDE, as a productive TDD environment for pytest. Specifically, we’ll show a workflow using pytest and PyCharm that helps make tests speed up development, or at the very least help to make testing seem less &amp;quot;in the way&amp;quot; of other development activities&lt;/p&gt;
