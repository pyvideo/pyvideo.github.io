Rust, on the other hand, is known for its lightning-fast runtime and low-level control, making it an attractive option for speeding up performance-sensitive portions of Python programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will present a case study of using Rust to speed up a critical component of a Python application. We will cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of Rust and its benefits for Python developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profiling and identifying performance bottlenecks in Python application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing a solution in Rust and integrating it with the Python application using PyO3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measuring the performance improvements and comparing them to other optimization techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn about the potential for using Rust to boost the performance of their Python programs and how to go about doing so in their own projects.&lt;/p&gt;
