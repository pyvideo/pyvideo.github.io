[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haskell is very different from Python, and provide different tools to
library and framework designers. As a result, its ecosystem is filled
with libraries and frameworks that solve the same problems we try to
solve in our favorite programming languages, but with a very different
approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is an exploration of the Haskell ecosystem, from the point
of view of a Python developer.
We will review various popular Haskell libraries and frameworks,
focusing on the library design. The goal is to provide the audience a
sneak peak of some different ways to tackle problems, and hopefully to
inspire library authors to explore some design space that we don't
usually explore in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk should be interesting to any intermediate Python programmer
who is curious about other ways to solve problems. No Haskell
knowledge is required from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
