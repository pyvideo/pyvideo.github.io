systems and operations engineers. While not as commonly used in the
data science world, metric collection tools and techniques can be
useful for scientific computing projects. In this talk I will show
how to instrument an application to collect metrics, and create a
dashboard view to monitor and explore the collected data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfluxDB is an open-source distributed time series database that is easy
to set up and to get started with. Grafana is a dashboarding tool that
works with InfluxDB and other time series back-ends. In this talk I will
present how to integrate an application with InfluxDB, and explore the
visualization capabilities that Grafana brings to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Log everything&amp;quot; is a great piece of advice for any project, especially
when going from exploratory phase of research to deploying a system to
production. Logs are invaluable for debugging and investigating specific
issues. However, individual logs are only snapshots of application runs
in time, and as the project grows and begins to incorporate multiple
services, data processing pipelines, and compute resources, the value
that can be immediately derived from bare logs diminishes. Logs also
tend to be wordy, and the more you log, the harder it is to find the
relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally time series databases were used to collect system metrics,
but they can be equally useful in gathering application specific
metrics. Logs can be complemented by metric gathering tools, which
collect the data that you care about and expose it in an easy to query
and to present manner. In conjunction with intuitive visualization and
dashboarding provided by Grafana, InfluxDB can give great insight into
inner workings of a system, and bring together all the disparate
information into an interface that makes metric data exploration
convenient. The two tools can help analyze performance bottlenecks,
algorithm deficiencies, and resource constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
