This framing will be used to introduce the skits library which provides a scikit-learn-compatible API for fitting and forecasting time series models using supervised machine learning. Finally, a real-world deployment of skits involving thousands of forecasts per hour will be demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, I will explore some models and domains that are not commonly thought of as “machine learning” problems and show how PyTorch allows one to build more complex and scalable models than ever before. This represents an opportunity to revisit existing models, which I will do by showing how to implement them with PyTorch and integrate them into the rest of the PyData ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

I will discuss lessons learned from this journey as well as the successful, deep learning-based approach.&lt;/p&gt;
