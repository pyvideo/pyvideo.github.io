school students: the National Computer Science School
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ncss.edu.au"&gt;http://www.ncss.edu.au&lt;/a&gt;) and the Girls' Programming Network
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sydney.edu.au/it/gpn"&gt;http://sydney.edu.au/it/gpn&lt;/a&gt;). For the past four years we have been
teaching Python to students in grades 9-12, and based on this experience
we will discuss why Python is a good first language and the parts of it
which are still difficult for students to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
