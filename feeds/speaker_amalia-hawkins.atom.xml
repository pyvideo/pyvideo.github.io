same: the ratio of male to female hackathon participants is often lower
than the ratio in the broader computer science community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can hackathon organizers be mindful of this issue, and encourage a
diverse pool of participants? This talk will cover the basics of how to
run an inclusive hackathon, as well as successful strategies organizers
have used in the past. We will examine case studies of several of the
largest college hackathons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a software engineer at MongoDB. Previously, I graduated from the
University of Pennsylvania, where I was a lead organizer for the
PennApps Hackathon and very involved in the college hackathon community.&lt;/p&gt;
