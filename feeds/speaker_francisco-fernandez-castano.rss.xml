this talk will explain how CPython works internally since
we type &lt;cite&gt;python myprogram.py&lt;/cite&gt; until our code is finally executed
explaining the process that CPython does to run our programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is explain people how to explore the code
of the interpreter itself using some common tools and let regular
Python developers that aren't used to work with C lose the fear
about looking under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2015]
[20 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Python programmers we're used to program without taking care about allocating
memory for our objects and later on freeing them, Python garbage collector
takes care of this task automatically for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garbage collection is one of the most challenging topics in computer science,
there are a lot of research around the topic and different ways to tackle
the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how our language does this process give us a better understanding
of underlying interpreter and allow us to know why problems like cycles
can happen in CPython interpreters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this talk aims to be and introduction to the topic and a walkaround
through different approaches followed in CPython and PyPy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generational Reference counting with cycles detector on CPython.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incremental version of the MiniMark GC on PyPy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

key-value, column databases and graph databases. In some scenarios is
more convenient to store our data as a graph, because we want to extract
and study information relative to these connections. In this scenario,
graph databases are the ideal, they are designed and implemented to deal
with connected information in a efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many kinds of NoSQL databases like, document databases,
key-value, column databases and graph databases. In some scenarios is
more convenient to store our data as a graph, because we want to extract
and study information relative to these connections. In this scenario,
graph databases are the ideal, they are designed and implemented to deal
with connected information in a efficient way. In this talk I'll explain
why NoSQL is necessary in some contexts as an alternative to traditional
relational databases. How graph databases allow developers model their
domains in a natural way without translating these domain models to an
relational model with some artificial data like foreign keys and why is
more efficient a graph database than a relational one or even a document
database in a high connected environment. Then I'll explain specific
characteristics of Neo4J as well as how to use Cypher the neo4j query
language through python.&lt;/p&gt;

to low level operations or connect with some database driver written in
C. With the FFI(Foreign function interface) we can connect Python with
other languages like C, C++ and even the new Rust. There are some
alternatives to achieve this goal, Native Extensions, Ctypes and CFFI.
I'll compare this three ways of extending Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will explore all the alternatives in cpython ecosystem
to load external libraries. In first place we'll study the principles
and how shared libraries work. After that we will look into the
internals of CPython to understand how extensions work and how modules
are loaded. Then we will study the main three alternatives to extend
CPython: Native Extensions, Ctypes and CFFI and how to automate the
process. Furthermore we will take a look to other python implementations
and how we can extend it.&lt;/p&gt;
