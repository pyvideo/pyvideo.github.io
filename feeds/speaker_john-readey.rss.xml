There has also been increased interest in the SciPy community with using cloud based computing to tackle challenging computational requirements. With the Highly Scalable Data Service (HSDS), a Python-based web-service, HDF5 data can now be read and written to object-based storage (e.g. AWS S3) and accessed over http using a RESTful api. As a web service this opens up many avenues to utilize HDF in ways that would have been difficult to achieve previously. In addition to the service itself, h5pyd is a package written specifically for Python clients that enables access to the HDF REST API in a way that is compatible with the popular h5py package.&lt;/p&gt;
