Tutorials, How-to topics, and References. Each addresses a different
customer need and each requires different amounts of time and types of
resources to produce. However, what happens on that fateful day you find
that you have more documentation to write than time will allow? (As a
technical writer, I call those weekdays). How can you prioritize which
documentation type and how much of it should be written and which topics
to write first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk provides guidance and encouragement to technical writers to
help them get the information they need to strategically get the right
docs to the right people at the right time—and learn a little bit more
about their stakeholders along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
