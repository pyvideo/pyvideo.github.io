The main
objective is to document all tests happening in your company, in order
to better understand which measures work and which don't. Thereby
leading to a better understanding of your product and your customer.
ABBY offers a front-end that makes it easy to edit, delete or create
tests and to add evaluation results. Further, it provides a RESTful API
to integrate directly with our platform to easily handle A/B tests
without touching the front-end. Another notable feature is the
possibility to upload a CSV file and have the A/B test auto-evaluated,
although this feature is considered highly experimental. At Jimdo, a
do-it-yourself website builder, we have a team of about 180 people from
different countries and with professional backgrounds just as diverse.
Therefore it is crucial to have tools that allow having a common
perspective on the tests. This facilitates having data informed
discussions and to deduce effective solutions. In our opinion tools like
ABBY are cornerstones to achieve the ultimate goal of being a
data-driven company. It enables all our co-workers to review past and
plan future tests to further improve our product and to raise the
happiness of our customers. The proposed talk will give a detailed
overview of ABBY, which eventually will be open-sourced, and its
capabilities. I will further discuss the motivation behind the app and
the influence it has on the way our company is becoming increasingly
data driven.&lt;/p&gt;
