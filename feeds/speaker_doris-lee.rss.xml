We'll focus on two key aspects: APIs and runtimes. First, we'll look at how you can run pandas at all data scales using Modin, and how this interoperates with other tools in the PyData stack. Then, we'll discuss ways to manage runtime compatibility, from customizing environments to working within notebook-based workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

However, despite its widespread adoption, pandas suffers from severe memory and performance issues on even moderately sized datasets. Modin is an open-source project that serves as a fast, scalable drop-in replacement for pandas (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/modin-project/modin"&gt;https://github.com/modin-project/modin&lt;/a&gt;). By changing just a single line of code, Modin seamlessly speeds up pandas workflow on a laptop or in a cluster. Originally developed at UC Berkeley, Modin has been downloaded more than 17 million times and is used by leading data science teams across industries.&lt;/p&gt;
