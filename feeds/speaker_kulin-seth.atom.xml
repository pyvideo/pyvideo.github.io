We will provide details about new features introduced in MPS backend such as how to add custom operations to your network and profiling applications using MPSProfiler &amp;amp; Instruments. Finally we will provide some debugging tips and best practices on MPS device and conclude with performance results on popular benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
