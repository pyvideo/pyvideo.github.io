For example, data scientists and ML practitioners often spend most of their time stitching and managing bespoke distributed systems to build end-to-end ML applications and push models to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, the Ray community has built Ray AI Runtime (Ray AIR), an open-source toolkit for building large-scale end-to-end ML applications.&lt;/p&gt;
