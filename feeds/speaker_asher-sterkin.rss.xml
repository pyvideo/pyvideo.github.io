For computation services (aka Function as a Service) Python is usually supported out of the box and at least in some environments (AWS) yields superior performance. However the same is for JavaScript with a strong argument in favor of full-stack development. In this talk I will demonstrate how by applying Domain-Driven Design patterns front-end services where JavaScript might be more suitable could be delineated from core domain services where Python has a number of clear advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
