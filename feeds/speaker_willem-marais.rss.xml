With decades of satellite observations, new scientific algorithms are employing Machine Learning (ML) methods to improve processing efficiencies and scientific analyses. In preparation for future developments, we are working with NASA Atmospheric Science Teams to understand ML requirements and assist in developing new tools that will benefit both the Science Teams and the broader Open-Source Science community. This talk will step through a ML methodology being used to identify cloud types and severe aerosols.&lt;/p&gt;
