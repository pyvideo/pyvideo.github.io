The model catalog in AzureML is your hub for foundation models. Azure native support for Llama 2 in the model catalog enables you use these models, without having to manage any of the infrastructure or environment dependencies. It provides out-of-the-box support for model finetuning and evaluation,  and includes options for optimizer libraries like DeepSpeed and ORT (ONNX RunTime), which speed up fine-tuning, and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models), which greatly reduces memory and compute requirements for fine-tuning. Deployments of Llama 2 models in Azure have Azure AI Content Safety integrated by default, offering a built-in layered approach to safety, and following responsible AI best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
