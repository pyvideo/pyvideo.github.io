&lt;p&gt;Python 3.10 is out there and with this comes Pattern Matching. With this
talk, you will be surprised how simple, yet powerful, Pattern Matching
really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk and you, it is a match! ðŸ”¥ Python 3.10 is out there now. This
was a two-digit minor version change since the last release, and with
this release new ways of thinking about programming were brought to the
Python language - Pattern Matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will understand what was there before Python Pattern Matching and how
to use Pattern Matching in different scenarios. We will pattern match
from simple data types to more complex ones, such as dictionaries and
objects. We will also understand how to use guards, and how can build
composable patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this talk, you will be surprised how simple, yet powerful,
Pattern Matching really is. This talk and you, it is a match!&lt;/p&gt;

alternative for search and analytics needs. When coupled with Python's
flexibility and the efficiency of serverless architecture, it transforms
into a dynamic trio that empowers developers to create efficient and
modern search applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us on a journey as we explore the synergy between OpenSearch,
Python, and serverless architecture. In this talk, we'll provide an
overview of OpenSearch and demonstrate how to utilize Python with
serverless architecture to power your search engine. Additionally, we
will delve into best practices and challenges that arise when employing
this combination in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this talk, you'll gain a clear understanding of how to
architect, build, and deploy efficient search applications using
OpenSearch, Python, and serverless architecture. Whether you're a
developer aiming to enhance your search capabilities or an architect
exploring modern search solutions, this talk will equip you with the
tools and insights needed to embrace this exciting synergy.&lt;/p&gt;
