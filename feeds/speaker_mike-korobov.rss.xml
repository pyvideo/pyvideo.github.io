Knowledge can be applied on practice at the same day. We'll be porting several libraries on evening workshop/sprint. I hope that after the report and the workshop everyone's skill of porting code on Python 3 is systematized. This skill will become necessary soon for reading majority popular project's code for example and for benefit of the World Civilization, why not?:-)&lt;/p&gt;
