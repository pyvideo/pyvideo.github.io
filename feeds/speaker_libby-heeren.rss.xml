I'd like you to forget about networking and start thinking about making friends. I'll share my perspective as a community builder and host of the Data Humans podcast on how I cultivated a community of practice for myself and how I became a force multiplier who increases engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll learn how I made genuine human connections, the practical steps to making data friends, the power of vulnerability, and why we all benefit when we show up as our whole selves.&lt;/p&gt;
