&amp;quot;Training Pizza Margherita &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Presented with Matteo Bertozzi)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python's high development speed and Qt's gargantuan feature set allow
for comfortable development of complex desktop applications. Still, what
does one need to do to best leverage this awesome combination? And more
importantly, what crucial advantages exist to decide its adoption in
favour of more traditional tecniques?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this training, we'll start from a white canvas and show how to
develop a desktop application using the best tools Qt offers. You'll
learn how to compose complex GUIs from basic building blocks, and how to
use QPainter, one of the most advanced 2D painting systems in the open
source world. Qt's Webkit integration will be discussed, along with the
recent Qt Quick technology, which allows one to create smooth and fluid
user interfaces. Qt's solution to common deployment problems, like
handling a serious translation workflow, will be presented. At the end,
we'll package our PyQt application so it's ready to be distributed for
download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk away with a sound understanding of why you should choose PyQt for
your next desktop project.&lt;/p&gt;
