Many believe that this innovation is simply about extracting data from the web while others consider web services as a step towards a global, massively distributed system. Web services have been used to extract data from diverse resources. According to IBM we have created about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. In fact 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone. This vast data set is a rich resource which can be used to develop intelligent systems. The other side of this coin is how to harness this huge amount of data and process/analyse it to predict certain parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will provide different simple examples of using Python to access web services and will also show how to analyse large quantities of data to make relatively succint predictions or decisions using machine learning algorithms in Python. This work is part of a research project in the tPOT research group in DIT which aims at developing context models for machine learning to support the care of intellectually impaired persons.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
