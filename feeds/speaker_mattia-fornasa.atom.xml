make sure that your algorithm performs well also in a domain different
than the one used during development. In this talk, I will share the
lessons we learned at Pacmed while externally validating Pacmed
Critical, a model that supports doctors in deciding the best moment to
discharge patients from the Intensive Care Unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacmed Critical predicts the probability that a patient will die or be
readmitted to the Intensive Care Unit, if he/she is discharged now. This
information will help doctors identify the best moment to discharge
their patients. The model has been developed using data from the
Amsterdam UMC but it needs to be validated on an external dataset from a
different hospital before it is implemented in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk you will discover the most common reasons why external
validation can go wrong, namely concept shift and covariate drift. You
will also learn how domain adaptation can address such problems by 1)
giving more weights to the examples that are more similar between the
two domains (importance weighting), 2) regularising the external model
towards the original one (sequential models), 3) including the
prediction of the original model as a feature of the external one
(another flavour of sequential models) and 4) defining different
hierarchies of domain-specific model coefficients (hierarchical models).
Which of these performs best depends on whether you can train a model on
both domains at the same time or if you can only do it separately. By
the end of the talk, you will know which techniques is the most suited
for your problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will be at the intermediate level: I will briefly
introduce the theory behind the domain-adaptation techniques discussed
and, then, I will focus on their applicability and impact in practice.
The presentation is targeted to data scientists who have experience in
the different phases of model development.&lt;/p&gt;
