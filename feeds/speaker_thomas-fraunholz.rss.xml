&lt;p&gt;Unlock the Power of Dev Containers: Consistent Environments in Seconds! by Thomas Fraunholz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/unlock-the-power-of-dev-containers-consistent-environments-in-seconds"&gt;https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/unlock-the-power-of-dev-containers-consistent-environments-in-seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will explore the basic concepts of Dev Containers and demonstrate how they can support your everyday development as a Python programmer, data scientist, or machine learning engineer. With Dev Containers, you can build a consistent development environment in seconds, no matter where you are or what tools you use. And you know what? The Development Container Specification is even open source. Say goodbye to the hassle of setting up your development environment from scratch every time you start a new project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start with a basic example and discuss how to set up a consistent Python development environment, including best practices for package management and GPU support. After this talk, you will be able to leverage the advantages of Dev Containers, allowing you to work from anywhere and be ready in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're tired of wasting time setting up your development environment and want to unlock the power of Dev Containers, then this talk is a must-attend for you!&lt;/p&gt;
