concurrency problem. For 20 years, the problem has been used to
highlight new concurrency features. Polyphonic C# sports an elegant
solution using join patterns. I prototyped a version of join patterns
for Stackless Python. Rather than hack Stackless Python's C code base, I
use PyPy's stackless.py module and greenlets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Andrew Francis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing how to use Python to prototype powerful concurrency features for
Stackless Python. We do want you to try this at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google’s introduction of the Go language raised eyebrows in the
Stackless Python community. Although very different languages, Go and
Stackless Python’s concurrency model share a common ancestor: the Bell
Labs family of languages (i.e., Newsqueak, Limbo). The common feature
are channels: a synchronous message passing mechanism based on Tony
Hoare’s Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Go and Python have channels. However with the select language
statement, Go has the ability to wait on multiple channels
simultaneously. Select greatly simplifies many concurrent programming
problems. Stackless Python does not have this feature. Other channel
based languages also feature powerful concurrency constructs. How hard
would these constructs be to implement for Stackless Python?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores the prototyping potential of stackless.py, the PyPy's
framework's implementation of Stackless Python. The beauty of
stackless.py is that it is written in Python and implements much of
Stackless Python's API! The &amp;quot;case study&amp;quot; involves prototyping Go's
select in stackless.py before reimplementing select in C based Stackless
Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk, it will be shown how stackless.py can be used with
CPython and the greenlet package (no need to install another Python).
The audience will also get an in depth look at how channels are
implemented. Channels are at the heart of Stackless Python's message
based concurrency model. Finally the audience will gain insights into
future directions of Stackless Python.&lt;/p&gt;
