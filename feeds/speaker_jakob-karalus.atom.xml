large &amp;amp; complex model (pipelines), doing these can take up a lot of
time. The traditional way usually includes one beefy machine and a lot
of waiting. In other cases, people tend to “manually” schedule parameter
ranges between nodes, but that can also be problematic since these won't
talk to each other. Kubernetes itself is currently the most prominent
scheduler and shines at distributing task, but is a pretty complex
system in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will show how you can harness the scheduling of
kubernetes for distributing hyperparameter search with sklearn onto a
cluster of nodes. This can be achieved quite easily and with just a few
changes to the original code, so the Data Scientist won't be bothered by
complex kubernetes internals.&lt;/p&gt;
