The PyData stack has many useful tools for performing EDA but the learning curve to use these tools can be steep. Sci-Analysis simplifies EDA by combining meaningful visualizations with the appropriate statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Amongst platform specific scripts, Makefiles, and CI pipelines, thereâ€™s no shortage of fragile, frustrating processes for building a software project. Build-magic aims to simplify builds with a declarative, repeatable tool for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
