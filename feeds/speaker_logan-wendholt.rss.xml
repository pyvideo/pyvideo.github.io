But do you know how to turn your snippet of code into a system capable of taking in streams of raw sensor data and spitting out insights? This presentation will lay out the basic components of a Python-based data pipeline built for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, and will highlight some of the common challenges associated with putting together an efficient data analytics and storage system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key topics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of cloud-based &amp;quot;serverless&amp;quot; data pipelines;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pros and cons of locally-hosted or &amp;quot;edge computing&amp;quot; systems;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tradeoffs between cost, scalability, complexity, and development time for different architectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this presentation, you will have gained a broad overview of the ecosystem needed to support a Python analytics solution: how to get data in and out, how to write and deploy scalable code, and how to manage system cost and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
