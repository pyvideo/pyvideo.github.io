&lt;p&gt;Right after the devastating earthquakes in Turkey, there has been a massive flow of tweets and posts from survivors and their relatives, calling for help. There was a need to extract the data, make it meaningful and open to public, so we have come up with afetharita.com. The machine learning part of the application is completely based on open-source tools in Python and I will go through the pipeline and the process.&lt;/p&gt;

We are trying to tackle these problems with our new open-source library skops. skops provides easy APIs to host your models, automatically create widgets for inference and create model cards that documents the model for versioning. In this talk, I will walk you through how you can use skops and Hugging Face Hub for versioning models.&lt;/p&gt;
