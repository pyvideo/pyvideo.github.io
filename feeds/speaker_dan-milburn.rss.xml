effects industry. Our talk will try to cover how our Python bindings let
users use NukeStudio as an environment for making their own tools for
video processing and compositing. This will involve going through a
couple of examples before going onto discussing the structure/design of
the bindings and how they also enable us to use NukeStudio in other
contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
