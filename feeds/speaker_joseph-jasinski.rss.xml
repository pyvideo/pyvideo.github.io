It often requires you to be familiar with systems administration, database administration, networking, security and more. Platform as a service (PaaS) offering, helps reduce this complexity by removing the need to manage the infrastructure on your own, and enables you to focus more on software development. This talk will cover what is needed and how to run a Django application on the popular PaaS, Heroku. It will detail project architectural and configuration changes needed to allow your app to run on Heroku, how to configure external services (such as a database and media file hosting), and the basic commands needed to deploy and manage your site. Throughout this talk, we will use a working codebase to demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday 12:15 p.m.--1 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience level: Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your site is slow. But why is your site slow? There are a myriad of
different problems that can cause this slowness. Drawn from real world
experiences, this talk will help identify different problem areas and
techniques for increasing performance. This involves both evaluating
your performance on the backend and understand bottlenecks on the
frontend. Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is will share with the audience our experience of improving
page load performance on a site. Performance evaluation is a scary
thing, especially for the inexperienced. This talk is not purely a &amp;quot;How
to Optimize Django&amp;quot; as it will discuss various aspects of what makes a
site appear slow to the end user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is slow? - How to identify where the problem and where to start&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Evaluation: - Django performance evaluation through
middleware and debug toolbar - Browser performance evaluation through
firebug, chrome developer toolkit, and third party tools, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Enhancement: - Reducing SQL queries - Leveraging server-side
caching - fragment caching - lower level caching - using a database
connection pooler - asset compression - CDN for media delivery - ajax
page loading - message queues&lt;/p&gt;
