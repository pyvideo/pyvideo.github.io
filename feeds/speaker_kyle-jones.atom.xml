&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will dive into the various resources required to develop and host modern software, some of the innovative ways in which large organisations like Microsoft are reducing their resource consumption, as well as the ways in which we can reduce our impact on the environment through architectural choices.&lt;/p&gt;
