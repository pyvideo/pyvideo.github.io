&lt;p&gt;Since being released by Facebook in 2015, GraphQL has gained a lot of hype for being the best thing since sliced bread and REST APIs. But what is all the hype about and how does GraphQL fare in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Django developer who has been using GraphQL in production since September 2017, I will discuss how we have addressed real-world concerns like performance and security. I will also highlight some of the joys of using GraphQL and why we have stopped writing REST APIs for new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never heard of GraphQL or have never used the Graphene library, have no fear. There will be an overview of what GraphQL is, as well as a demo on how to incorporate it into a Django project using Graphene.&lt;/p&gt;
