configure and deploy your Python web app on various Google Cloud
Platform services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start by demonstrating how to setup and deploy a Python web app
on both Standard and Flexible Google App Engine platforms. After that,
we will show how to provision a Linux VM on Google Cloud to run a python
web app. We will then explore how to package our Python web app into a
docker image and deploy the same on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
Finally, we will explore Google Cloud Functions and how to write a
serverless app in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience for this talk is generally Python web developers and devops
engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

Python, Go and Java runtimes. From that time , we have seen many popular
Python web applications deployed on Google App Engine’s Standard
Environment. Even with the awesomeness of App Engine, Pythonistas felt
limited by what the standard environment offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App Engine Flexible Environment (Previously called Managed VM’s) solved
the pain points that developers encountered: It allows developers to
customize their Python runtime and even the underlying operating system
using Dockerfiles. App Engine automatically scales your web app and
offers automatic load balancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore how to implement microservices, authorization,
SQL and noSQL databases, traffic splitting, logging, full text search,
versioning, security scanning, memcache, and content delivery networks
using App Engine Flexible Environment. This will be shown in practice
through the deployment of a Python/Django Application on the App Engine
Flexible Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
