create images from a simple phrase. Now, you want to get your hands
dirty training some state of the art (SOTA) deep learning models. We
will use Jupyter notebooks to fine-tune an NLP model based on BERT to do
sentiment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this hands-on tutorial, we will learn about using HuggingFace models
from pre-trained open-source checkpoints and adapting these models to
our own specific tasks. We will see that using SOTA NLP and computer
vision models has been made easier with a combination of HuggingFace and
PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this session, you will know how to fine-tune a large
public pre-trained model to a particular task and have more confidence
navigating the deep learning open source landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
