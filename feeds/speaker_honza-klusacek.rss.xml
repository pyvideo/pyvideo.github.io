Some people have turned
cracking puzzles into a hobby and gave rise to events dedicated to
solving such problems – puzzlehunts. TMOU is the oldest and biggest
one among them. During these games, players regularly feel the
frustration from endless unsuccessful efforts, often quickly followed
by extraordinary joy after finally figuring out the peculiar problem.
This joy can only be surpassed by creating a perfect puzzle for
others to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will share a few lessons learnt while organizing TMOU, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes a problem seemingly impossible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to turn impossible into possible and hard into not-so-hard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to crack tough problems and hammer down their complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Python might be a good hammer for that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the creation of a specific puzzle from an initial idea to the
final design (puzzle #4 &amp;quot;the Dice&amp;quot;, TMOU 17

need to solve a bunch of problems just to create a new one?&lt;/p&gt;
