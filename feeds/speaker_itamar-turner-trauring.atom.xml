&lt;p&gt;By Itamar Turner-Trauring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your program is using too much memory, it can crash, thrash, or just run more slowly. To reduce memory usage, you need to measure it somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of tools to measure Python memory usage, however. Which one should you pick? This depends heavily on your use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk you will learn about the different ways memory problems manifest in Python, the memory usage patterns of different application types, and which tools to use in each situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For web applications, the typical problem is memory leaks: memory that is never freed adds up if your program runs forever. That means you need tools to help you identify the source of memory leaks, whether in Python or in C extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For data processing applications like data science or scientific computing, the problem is typically caused by processing large amounts of data. Here you need to find the peak memory usage, and what code what responsible for it.&lt;/p&gt;

discover even more form of testing, many of them very different in their
goals: A/B testing, say, where you see which of two versions of your
website results in more signups or ad clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do these forms of testing differ, how do they relate to each other?
How do you choose which kind of testing to pursue, given limited time
and resources? How do you deal with strongly held yet opposite views
arguing either that a particular kind of testing is essential or that
it's a waste time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide you with a model, a way to organize all forms of
testing and understand what exactly they provide, and why. Once you
understand the model you will be able to choose the right form of
testing for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; situation and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure the computation ran as expected. Debug problems that may have
occurred far along within your computation. Identify and localize
performance problems: which parts of your computation were slow, and

&lt;p&gt;Using a more efficient in-memory representation.

Streaming parsing, which can parse arbitrarily-large files with a fixed amount of memory.
Using a different file format, like JSON Lines.&lt;/p&gt;

As a result, it can be unclear what’s important, what’s not, where to start, and what to put off until later. If you’re not careful, you can get distracted by optimizing your Docker image size, and neglect to make your image secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying problem is that Docker packaging is complicated: it’s at the intersection of multiple organizational processes, from development, to deployment, to debugging, to upgrades. Add on 50 years of technology development going back to early Unix design decisions, and the result is a huge number of details to get right, many of which interact with each other in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, once you understand how Docker packaging fits in with all the development and operational processes you’re already doing, those details become a lot less daunting. In particular, by following a structured iterative process for creating your Docker packaging artifacts (Dockerfile etc.), you can think through the decisions you’ll need to make, figure out which new processes you need to start implementing, and make sure you’ve implemented the important details first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you take control of your packaging, this talk will cover an iterative six-step process for packaging an application with Docker, starting with security and ending up with optimizations like build time and image size, along with a few examples of some of the relevant best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
