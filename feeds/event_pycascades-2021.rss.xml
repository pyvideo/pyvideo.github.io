Combining Python with Apache Flink, particularly for Machine Learning, has its complications, but can also produce an incredibly fast, portable, scalable, and highly flexible data pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers the structure and technical features of a Python-Flink pipeline. It also goes over getting started, and more importantly - addressing the common mistakes and hurdles of building one. This includes which features to use and how to leverage the strengths of each framework based on your specific use case. For instance, when would you use regular Python, and when would you want to use PyFlink? Are there cases where you would NOT want to use some of the abstraction or automation tools available for these frameworks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will get out of this talk an introduction to working with Apache Flink with Python, and pragmatic tips and tricks for a smoother, faster, more enjoyable (because this should be fun!) dive into this symbiotic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is geared towards those who are new to Flink but is applicable to anyone with beginner to advanced Python experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discovering that many major cities in the United States have open data projects that allow for a level of transparency. I was happy to discover that my own city had data available but quickly realized that the data had many issues that would make it difficult to analyze as-is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will show how I was able to consolidate &amp;quot;Calls for Service&amp;quot; to the San Diego Police Department since 2015. This was done by importing the city-provided CSV files into Pandas DataFrames and making modifications to standardize data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also convert approximate location data to a geo_point using Public geoJSON data and the filter capabilities in Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I will show how you can bulk upload the data into and out of Elasticsearch via eland so that it can be visualized in Kibana or a public graphing platform and how I automated this process to check for updates.&lt;/p&gt;

What are the major options for debugging, what advantages and disadvantages do they have? We’ll start the talk by giving the audience an overview of the history of debugging and existing tools so they know how to pick from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we’ll help the audience gain a deeper understanding of what debugging is really about, and talk about two pain points with existing solutions. We’ll introduce a novel approach to solve these pain points, with basic introduction to bytecode tracing so the audience can learn this useful technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’ll look into the future and talk about why it’s important to be more innovative. We hope that by listening to this talk, the audience can be more open-minded thinking about debugging, and programming as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No specific knowledge required, but basic experience with debugging would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll cover some high level concepts you’ll need to understand games, like events, event loops, and state modeling. Then we’ll cover the constraints and expectations of PursuedPyBear, Python’s newest game framework. Then we’ll discuss a summary its extensibility features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, viewers should be prepared to make a game in PursuedPyBear and have a selection of resources for how to improve their knowledge and skill set with video games.&lt;/p&gt;

Cubesats -- satellites the size of a loaf of bread, or even smaller -- can be built for as little as a few thousand dollars, but are capable enough to track ships, watch for earthquakes, or even observe exoplanets.  &amp;quot;Ease of launch&amp;quot; does not mean &amp;quot;ease of operation&amp;quot;, though; the satellites send a wealth of telemetry back to earth, and turning that flood of information into action is difficult.  This difficulty only increases as fleets scale in size, from one-off research projects to hundreds of satellites providing commercial services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since beginning in 2018, the Polaris project has used Python's rich ecosystem to build a machine learning pipeline applicable to any mission.  Polaris analyzes telemetry for each satellite, automatically extracts dependencies among its components, and displays these in an interactive, browser-based 3D graph.  Spacecraft operators can navigate their graph and understand relations between their telemetry, as well as external parameters such as space weather. This gives operators another tool to monitor performance, diagnose problems, and predict satellite behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience: This talk is aimed at a general audience of people interested in Python, machine learning or space exploration; no expertise is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“urllib3 is a tool that speaks a special language that lets you download puppy pictures from the Internet”. That language that urllib3 speaks is “HTTP”. HTTP is one of the most important network protocols ever invented, so much so that engineers are rewriting TCP just so cellphones can speak HTTP better and DNS is done over HTTPS because it’s easier to secure HTTP than it is to secure DNS. HTTP is ubiquitous and it’s likely not going away any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then it matters that Python’s HTTP story is a very good one.  In the beginning Python’s included HTTP library had a few key missing features, like supporting HTTPS for security, redirects, connection pooling, thread safety, multipart encoding, retries, and compression.  All of these features are necessities of an HTTP library and when urllib3 was first written these things weren’t so easy with the standard library, so Andrey created urllib3 in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around that same time came Python 3, things became even tougher because the HTTP library had changed between Python 2 and 3 along with Python’s handling of binary strings. urllib3 juggles all of these nuances to make HTTP easy for users, especially those who were trying to write libraries that also supported Python 2 and 3 to make the migration between the two major versions smoother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that 12 years have passed, urllib3 is as ubiquitous within the Python ecosystem as HTTP. The package was downloaded over a billion times in the past 12 months, about 3 millions times per day. And with Python 2 riding off into the sunset our team is looking to solve new challenges coming for Python and HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;

The advent of CircuitPython - a variant of Python built to run on small microcontrollers and interact easily with hardware - has helped to facilitate her creative process by making it cheap and simple to quickly iterate and prototype new designs. Many CircuitPython modules exist which allow creators to control different types and configurations of LEDs with only a few lines of code. Debra will display some of her works and discuss how she uses CircuitPython in her creations.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the Jupyter Notebook document that’s produced -- the &lt;em&gt;.ipynb&lt;/em&gt; file -- was not easily testable in the same variety of coding situations as other extension formats like plain &lt;em&gt;.py&lt;/em&gt; files. For certain situations end-to-end execution tools like papermill allow for testing the entire document as one unit, but individual unittesting of code snippets from the file was difficult or impossible to achieve without exporting to a new format and refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notebooks in recent years have exploded in popularity, with millions of notebooks on github alone. To alleviate the pain point for testing these notebooks, we created a new library called testbook. The testbook library is a unit testing framework for testing code in Jupyter Notebooks with pytest patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous attempts at unit testing notebooks involved writing the tests in the notebook itself, which was faulty, difficult to read, and even more difficult to maintain. However, testbook allows for unit tests to be run against notebooks in separate test files, hence treating .ipynb files as .py files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### Features of the testbook library&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write conventional unit tests for Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute all or some specific cells before unit test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share kernel context across multiple tests (using pytest fixtures)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for patching objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inject code into Jupyter notebooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works with any unit testing library - unittest, pytest or nose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### Outline of the talk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Better support of non-Python kernels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Many people feel that you should start in DRF with the &lt;cite&gt;APIView&lt;/cite&gt; and a manual serializer, but I disagree! DRF ships with some powerful tools that make developers' lives easier, and many people never even learn what those tools are. Using the built-in tools like &lt;cite&gt;ModelViewSet&lt;/cite&gt;, coupled with always having Classy DRF open in a tab, helped me gain a full understanding of how DRF worked (and a better understanding of how Django worked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is not a DRF tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 min: Intro, why the audience can trust me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 min (running total: 4 min): &lt;cite&gt;ModelViewSet&lt;/cite&gt; and how it's composed of all the mixins that allow you to perform different operations on your database objects (&lt;cite&gt;CreateModelMixin&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;RetrieveModelMixin&lt;/cite&gt;, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 min (running total: 6 min) The basic attributes that are added to most Viewsets like &lt;cite&gt;permission_classes&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;queryset&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;serializer_class&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 min (running total: 11 min) How to override built-in methods to customize behavior, like overriding &lt;cite&gt;get_serializer_class()&lt;/cite&gt; to return different serializers for List vs. Detail requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 min (running total: 15 min) How to add multiple permission classes to &lt;cite&gt;permission_classes&lt;/cite&gt; to create modular permissions. Note: This will not cover how to write custom permission classes, only how to use them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 min (running total: 20 min) Overview of the generic views, noting how they are also just combinations of the &lt;cite&gt;APIView&lt;/cite&gt; and the necessary mixins. Notes on when you might use them (example: you want a viewset that allows all actions except delete)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 min (running total: 24 min) How to customize the API by adding an action to a viewset when you need something different than the built-in CRUD operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 min (running total: 25 min) Outro, where to find me to ask questions, where to find the slides, links to further learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be referring to [Classy DRF](&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cdrf.co/"&gt;http://www.cdrf.co/&lt;/a&gt;) throughout the talk. In my experience, many people find the [Classy Class-Based Views](&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ccbv.co.uk/"&gt;https://ccbv.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;), [Classy DRF](&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cdrf.co/"&gt;http://www.cdrf.co/&lt;/a&gt;), and that family of helper websites confusing, until they learn how to use them. I want to help the audience learn to use these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This is a new talk for me. I tend to rehearse my talks a lot, so if time is too tight I will know that ahead of time. The section I would cut for time would be &amp;quot;Overview of the generic views,&amp;quot; because this idea will be introduced in the &lt;cite&gt;ModelViewSet&lt;/cite&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three amazing in-person conferences, this time we're moving PyCascades online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCascades is a regional PyCon in the Pacific Northwest, celebrating the west coast Python developer and user community. Our organizing team includes members of the Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland Python user groups.&lt;/p&gt;
