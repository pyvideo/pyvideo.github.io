Through an in-depth look at some real-world examples from Janssen R&amp;amp;D moving towards R and Python, we will show you how it's done. This isn't just theory; it's practical, actionable advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we embark on a journey to weave R and Python into the fabric of our organization, let's keep these insights and strategies at the forefront. Together, we can redefine what it means to be adaptable and resilient in an ever-changing world.&lt;/p&gt;
