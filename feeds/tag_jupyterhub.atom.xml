We use this in practice to serve a broad community of atmospheric and climate scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric and climate scientists analyze large volumes of observational and simulated data to better understand our planet.  They have historically used tools like NumPy and SciPy along with Jupyter notebooks to combine efficient computation with accessibility.  However, as datasets increase in size and collaboration extends to new populations of scientists these tools begin to feel their age.  In this talk we use more recent libraries to build a modern deployment for academic scientists.  In particular we use the following tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dask:&lt;/strong&gt; to parallelize and scale NumPy computations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XArray&lt;/strong&gt;: as a self-discribing data model and tool kit for labeled and index arrays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JupyterLab:&lt;/strong&gt; to enable more APIs for users beyond the classic notebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JupyterHub:&lt;/strong&gt; to manage users and maintain environments for a new population of cloud-friendly users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes:&lt;/strong&gt; to manage everything and deploy easily on cloud hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus less on how these libraries work and will instead be a case study of using them together in an operational setting.  During the talk we will build up and deploy a running system that the audience can then use to access distributed computing resources.&lt;/p&gt;

Jupyter Notebooks and the rich Python ecosystem with libraries on a variety of topics can engage many learners of the sciences and humanities. Interactive content, using Jupyter Widgets and visualization libraries, put the student in charge of manipulating content and extending their learning. Giving students engaging content in familiar subjects encourages them to develop and use computational skills to build upon their interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One difficulty of teaching workshops is access to computers and the ability to install software on those systems. This talk will demonstrate how a workshop organizer or teacher can deploy JupyterHub easily for a class using the Zero to JupyterHub Guide, Kubernetes, and Cloud Services. Even if students only have access to smartphones, tablets, or shared computers, a workshop can be held using Binder which allows a notebook environment to be served at the click of a button to any modern web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Florian Rhiem is a scientific software developer at Forschungszentrum Jülich in the Scientific IT-Systems department of Peter Grünberg Institute / Jülich Centre for Neutron Science. In 2014, he finished his master's thesis on visualization of multidimensional functions and graduated as Master of Science in Technomathematics. He works with Python and C, mostly focusing on 3D visualization software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter Notebooks combine executable code and rich text elements in a web application. In this talk you will learn how a custom JupyterHub installation can be used to integrate Jupyter Notebooks into your infrastructure, including existing authentication methods and custom software distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter Notebooks allow you to create and share interactive documents containing both rich text and executable code. As researchers, you can write Notebooks that allow your readers to reproduce your results on their own. As data scientists, you can use interactive visualizations to explore and analyze data sets directly in your browser. With official support for Python, Julia and R and community support for programming languages ranging from Fortran to JavaScript, Jupyter can be used in a wide variety of workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you will learn how a custom JupyterHub installation has been used to seamlessly integrate Jupyter Notebooks into the existing infrastructure at the Jülich Centre for Neutron Science and the Peter Grünberg Institute. After introducing JupyterHub and its components, the presentation will show how each can be customized to use already existing resources and services, such as LDAP authentication, NFS-based storage and custom software distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

As Jupyter Notebook has gained in popularity, the steps needed to use it within such an environment have proven to be a barrier to entry even as increasingly powerful Python tools have developed to take advantage of large computational resources. JupyterHub to the rescue! Except out of the box, it doesn't know anything about resource types, job submission, and so on. We developed BatchSpawner and friends as a general JupyterHub backend for batch-scheduled environments. In this talk I will walk through how we have deployed JupyterHub to provide a user-friendly gateway to interactive supercomputing.&lt;/p&gt;
