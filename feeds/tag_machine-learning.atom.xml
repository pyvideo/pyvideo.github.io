This is a problem especially in high stake sectors like banking and healthcare. In this talk we will discuss how we can increase transparency, auditability, and stability of the model using valuable insights we can get from SHAP and explain reasoning behind individual predictions and how this can be aggregated into powerful model-level insights. We will also see the code to calculate SHAP values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Sound is a rich source of information about the world around us.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Modern deep learning approaches can give human-like performance on a
range of sound classifiction tasks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This makes it possible to build systems that use sound to for example:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;understand speech, to analyze music, to assist in medical diagnostics,
detect quality problems in manufacturing, and to study the behavior of
animals.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk will show you how to build practical machine learning models
that can classify sound.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We will convert sound into spectrograms, a visual representation of
sound over time,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;and apply machine learning models similar to what is used to for image
classification.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The focus will be on Convolutional Neural Networks, which have been
shown to work very well for this task.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The Keras and Tensorflow deep learning frameworks will be used. Some
tricks for getting usable results with small amounts of data will be
covered, including transfer learning, audio embeddings and data
augmentation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A basic understanding of machine learning is recommended.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Familiarity with digital sound is a bonus.&lt;/div&gt;

big bank took on the challenge to transform a fragmented sales process
into a data-driven one using Python and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk outlines the various ways Python has been instrumental in
delivering a production solution that serves advisers and relationship
manager on a continuous basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The Challenge&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- A bank has many clients with diverse needs and cost pressures mean
fewer advisers resulting in reduced client coverage.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Multiple sales channels and mixed service levels meant sales
processes were uncoordinated and driven by heuristics and often very
subjective.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- And... Excel sheets everywhere!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Solution&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Go data-driven!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Learn from clients and understand product usage&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Empower and inform advisers and call centre agents&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Build a front-to-back sales process (no more Excels!)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- How? With Python!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The Python Bits&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Scikit learn machine learning pipelines that implement two distinct
approaches to product affinity in banking and wealth management&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- SQL Alchemy based API for data engineering and rapid prototyping of
analytics&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Pandas and Jupyter for development and collaboration&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Luigi pipeline for daily processing of millions of transactions and
engineering features&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Extracting features from text with NLP (Spacy)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Delivering machine learning interpretability in production, e.g.
with Random Forests and treeinterpreter&lt;/div&gt;

scientists is cleaning the data to analyze it. Textbook statistical
modeling is sufficient for noisy signals, but errors of a discrete
nature break standard tools of machine learning. I will discuss how to
easily run machine learning on data tables with two common dirty-data
problems: missing values and non-normalized entries. On both problems, I
will show how to run standard machine-learning tools such as
scikit-learn in the presence of such errors. The talk will be didactic
and will discuss simple software solutions. It will build on the latest
improvements to scikit-learn for missing values and the DirtyCat package
[2] for non normalized entries. I will also summarize theoretical
analyses in recent machine learning publications.&lt;/p&gt;

scientists to be more efficient analysing data with such errors and

how to obtain asymptotically good predictions [3]. Two components are
key: imputation and adding an indicator of missingness. I will explain
theoretical guidelines for these, and I will show how to implement these
ideas in practice, with scikit-learn as a learner, or as a preprocesser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-normalized categories, I will show that using their string
representations to “vectorize” them, creating vectorial representations
gives a simple but powerful solution that can be plugged in standard
statistical analysis tools [4].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Getting started with a natural language processing and neural networks
is easier nowadays thanks to the numerous talks and tutorials. The
goal is to dive deeper for those who already know the basics, or want
to expand their knowledge in a machine learning field.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The talk will start with the common use cases that can be generalized
to the specific problems in a NLP world. Then I will present an
overview of possible features that we can use as input to our network,
and show that even simple feature engineering can change our results.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Furthermore, I will compare different network architectures - starting
with the fully connected networks, through convolution neural networks
to recursive neural networks. I will not only considering the good
parts, but also - what is usually overlooked - pitfalls of every
solution.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;All of these will be done considering number of parameters, which
transfers into training and prediction costs and time. I will also
share a number of “tricks” that enables getting the best results even
out of the simple architectures, as these are usually the fastest and
quite often hard to beat, at the same time being the easiest to
interpret.&lt;/div&gt;

able to collect data in greater volumes and with finer resolution. There
has been a growing interest in leveraging this vast volume of data
across levels of analysis, measurement techniques, and experimental
paradigms to gain more insight into brain function. At multiple stages
and levels of neuroscience investigation, ML holds great promise as an
addition to the arsenal of analysis tools for discovering how the brain
works. As quantitative analysis of brain MRI is routine for many
neurological diseases and conditions, deep learning-based segmentation
approaches for brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are gaining
interest due to their self-learning and generalisation ability over
large amounts of data. On the other hand, High Performance Computing
(HPC) and AI will increasingly intertwine as we transition to an
exascale future using new computing, storage, and communications
technologies. In this talk I will walk you through fundamentals of
generating high- performance deep-learning models in TensorFlow platform
using Python on large computing system (e.g NVIDIA® Tesla® GPUs powered
by Tensor Cores), in order to infer and segment thousands of cell
centroids out of the brain objects of interest. From a more
technological perspective, although astonishing results have been
achieved concerning the distribution of training large convolutional
neural networks on big data, to date the Python scientific ecosystem is
still missing tools for an optimised and, above all, distributed
inference of deep learning models. In this talk I will show you how a
tiling-based inferencing approach could be a good solution to remedy the
problem. The talk is intended for intermediate PyData researchers and
practitioners. Basic to intermediate level experience in image
recognition/object detection deep learning applications is assumed.

of the next frontiers of DevOps. With the advent of Redis modules and
the availability of C APIs for the major deep learning frameworks, it is
now possible to turn Redis into a reliable runtime for deep learning
workloads, providing a simple solution for a model serving microservice.
In this talk we will introduce RedisAI, a joint effort by Orobix and
RedisLabs that introduces tensors and graphs as new Redis data types and
allows to execute graphs over tensors using multiple backends (PyTorch,
TensorFlow, and ONNXRuntime), both on the CPU and GPU. The module also
supports scripting with TorchScript, which provides a Python-like tensor
language that can be used to facilitate pre- and post-processing
operations, like input shaping or output ensambling. In addition, thanks
to its support for the ONNX standard, including ONNX-ML, RedisAI is not
strictly limited to deep learning, but it offers support for general
machine learning algorithms. In this talk, we will demonstrate a full,
Python-powered journey from fine tuning a model to a scalable Flask +
RedisAI deployment. Last, we will lay down the roadmap for the future,
like automated batching, sharding, integration with Redis data types
(e.g. streams) and advanced monitoring. The talk will include sample

of data that humans supposed to exceed in - images, video, sounds,

generate new images or sounds. Meanwhile, we are forgetting about
another very important source of data - signals (or time series, which
will be interchangeably here), that gets less hype in public but
benefits a lot from applying deep learning comparing to classical
approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will review what are sources of time series and what
business goals are we solving while analyzing them, what are “old” tools
for analysis and how deep neural nets overcome them, we will learn the
latest trends and ruin some myths and, moreover, we will see how
generative models can be applied to the signal processing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this talk, you’ll be able to boost your current solutions in
signal processing or time series analysis with deep learning. It will be
also interesting for practitioners in other areas, like computer vision
or NLP since we will discuss some concepts that are widely applicable.

is paramount. This understanding can come from many different sources
and techniques: domain expertise, exploratory analysis, SMEs, some
specific Machine Learning techniques, and feature engineering. As a
matter of fact, most Machine Learning and Statistical analysis strongly
depends on how the data is prepared, thus making feature engineering
very important for any serious Machine Learning enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into
features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive
models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will discuss what feature engineering and feature
selection are; how to select important features in a real-world dataset
and how to develop a simple, but powerful ensemble to measure feature
importance and perform feature selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with intermediate concepts of the Python programming
language is required to follow the implementation steps. General
knowledge of the basic concepts of Machine Learning and data cleaning
will be useful, but not strictly necessary, to follow the discussion on
feature selection and feature engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;We humans are the masterpieces. We are born with awesome capabilities
and applaudable talents making us different from one another. As an
individual , nobody thinks the way others do , they have their own
intriguing ways to look at this world. Few of us have this exceptional
quality to be able to visualise sounds and map colours with the words.
It is termed as Synesthesia. It is fascinating to know how human brain
can see sounds and hear colours, how it thinks of a word, and sees
blocks of colours, and then these blocks get translated into letters.
There are few who see the letters with a halo-effect. The letters
give- off almost a glow of a certain colour.It is a striking fact that
the synesthetic brains are wired a little differently from the ones of
non-synesthetes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk will cover the interesting applications of python
programming by harnessing simple mathematical techniques to simulate
the synesthetic ( bridging modalities) behaviour of brain. It is
really appealing to be able to look at the world wearing colourful
shades and building an AI that does bridge these modalities (vision ,
hearing ,etc ) is truly astounding. The talk covers an interesting
viewpoint on how python can be used widely to analyse some of the
really complex human brain behaviours ,in addition to solving
comparatively trivial real world problems.&lt;/div&gt;

Previously restricted to math geniuses with access to supercomputers and massive data centres, machine learning tools are increasingly available as web services which are easily consumed from more traditional web applications. Python has become the lingua franca of machine learning, so Python developers are well placed to take advantage of the next wave of application development. This talk outlines the various machine learning platforms and provides a set of practical examples that demonstrate how Python developers can start taking advantage of artificial intelligence in their own applications.  The intended audience is pretty wide: web developers, students, data scientists should all come away with a set of ideas and tools for implementing machine learning without needing a degree in artificial intelligence!&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk I will describe how we are building an image recognition system with the aim of identifying all known species in the natural world. The system has gone through a number of iterations at this point using a variety of computer vision and machine learning techniques, from nearest neighbour search to classification with fine tuned deep convolutional networks. All of this has been implemented in Python using scikit-learn, Numpy, Caffe and Tensorflow. Aside from the obvious machine learning challenges in designing and training such a system we faced numerous technical challenges while implementing and scaling this system in a cost effective manner. I will discuss these challenges, our solutions and the remaining open problems. While this talk will be relatively high level with few code examples and no math (but lots moths), it will be of most interest to those who have some knowledge of machine learning concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

We will provide a demo taking relevant scientific packages and develop a simple algorithm to detect bony anatomy. A 3D printable model will be produced at the end of the demo. We will also show how we use existing 3D mesh python packages to adjust properties of the object for visualisation in screen and mixed reality platforms. The healthcare sector produces vast quantities of three dimensional images for the diagnosis and treatment of a large variety of medical conditions. Traditionally, the 3D images are reviewed by a highly qualified healthcare professional such as a radiologist or surgeon. As a result, the diagnosis and treatment of patient is time consuming, expensive and not scalable; moreover, this approach has limited efficacy as the medical doctor may not be able to obtain a general understanding of the anatomic three dimensional structure (e.g the shape and size of a tumor, the position of each bony fragment in a complex fracture, the location of an aneurysm together with surrounding vasculature, etc). The talk will focus on the advanced image processing techniques and Deep Learning approaches that are in active development developed both within academia and the private sector. These approaches aim to achieve a faster and better understanding of medical scans. They allow healthcare systems to provide a cheaper, faster and more effective medical service to patients. The results of the image analysis can then be rendered to the medical staff using a Virtual Reality, or an Augmented Reality system. 3D prints can also be employed to convey a very tangible experience as well as allow the medical staff to prepare for the operation by setting up a mock procedure on the 3D prints.&lt;/p&gt;

When such a blood clot enters the cardiovascular system, it first must travel along the ascending aorta. The clot may travel along the aortic arch and travel towards the brain through the left and right common carotid arteries. If clot enters these vessels, it can become lodged within the smaller vessels of the brain and cause a stroke. We apply supervised machine learning classifiers (logit, SVM) for detecting stroke probability using simulation data. Various scenarios are implemented to examine the impact of variables such as shape of the aortic arch, varying clot dimensions and the entry point. Model selection tools (grid search, cross-validation) and classification probability are calculated for each classifier. Application will be shown using Jupyter notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

a static graph. Where TensorFlow shows greater adoption and additional
useful extensions with TensorFlow Serving and TensorBoard, Pytorch
proves useful trough its easy and more pythonic API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data scientists are confronted with explorative challenges, but also
need to be aware of model deployment and production. Do we need to
single out frameworks until we end up with the only one or is there a
case for joint usage of two deep learning frameworks? Can we leverage
the strengths of the frameworks for different tasks along the path from
exploration to production?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I want to present a case combining the benefits of PyTorch

tasks. Therefore, I will choose a common deep learning challenge and
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of both frameworks along a demo

(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://copernicus.eu"&gt;http://copernicus.eu&lt;/a&gt;) makes it possible to perform terrestrial
observations providing data for all kinds of purposes. One important
objective is to monitor the land-use and land-cover changes with the
Sentinel-2 satellite mission. These satellites measure the sun
reflectance on the earth surface with multispectral cameras (13 channels
between 440 nm to 2190 nm). Machine learning techniques like
convolutional neural networks (CNN) are able to learn the link between
the satellite image (spectrum) and the ground truth (land use class). In
this talk, we give an overview about the state-of-the-art land-use
classification with CNNs based on an open dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EuroSAT benchmark dataset (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://madm.dfki.de/downloads"&gt;http://madm.dfki.de/downloads&lt;/a&gt;) is freely
provided by German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI).
It consists of 27.000 image patches for ten different land use/cover
classes, e.g. industrial and residential areas, different crop and
vegetation types and forests. All samples have 64 by 64 pixel dimension
and include either only the RGB images or all 13 bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use different out-of-box CNNs for the Keras deep learning
library (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://keras.io/"&gt;https://keras.io/&lt;/a&gt;). All networks are either included in Keras
itself or are available from Github repositories. We will show the
process of transfer learning for the RGB datasets. Furthermore, the
minimal changes required to apply commonly used CNNs to multispectral
data are demonstrated. Thus, the interested audience will be able to
perform their own classification of remote sensing data within a very
short time. Results of different network structures are visually
compared. Especially the differences of transfer learning and learning
from scratch are demonstrated. This also includes the amount of
necessary training epochs, progress of training and validation error and
visual comparison of the results of the trained networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we give a quick overview about the current research topics
including recurrent neural networks for spatio-temporal land-use
classification and further applications of multi- and hyperspectral
data, e.g. for the estimation of water parameters and soil
characteristics. Additionally, we provide links to the code and dataset
used in this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

the recent past and build the core of many data scientist's workplace.
Being accessed via web browser they allow scientists to easily structure
their work by combining code and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet notebooks often lead to isolated and disposable analysis artefacts.
Keeping the computation inside those notebooks does not allow for
convenient concurrent model training, model exposure or scheduled model
retraining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those issues can be addressed by taking advantage of recent developments
in the discipline of software engineering. Over the past years
containerization became the technology of choice for crafting and
deploying applications. Building a data science platform that allows for
easy access (via notebooks), flexibility and reproducibility (via
containerization) combines the best of both worlds and addresses Data
Scientist's hidden needs.&lt;/p&gt;

models to well-groomed datasets. Everyone working on industrial problems
will eventually learn, that this does not reflect reality. The amount of
time spent on modeling is small compared to data gathering, -warehousing
and -cleaning. Even after training and deployment of the model, the work
is not done. Continuous monitoring of the performance and input data is
still necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I discuss how important data handling is for successful
data science projects. Each milestone, from finding the business case to
continuously monitoring the performance of the solution, is addressed.
This is exemplary shown on a project, with the goal of improving a

It
allows accessing it from various programming environments and also
decouples the development and deployment of the models from its use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, building an good API is hard. It involves many nitty-gritties
and many of them need to repeated everytime an API is built. Also, it is
very important to have a client library so that the API can be easily
accessed. If you every plan to use it from Javascript directly, then you
need to worry about cross-origin-resource-sharing etc. All things add up
and building APIs for machine very tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk demonstrates how deploying machine learning models an APIs
can be made fun by using right programming abstractions. This presents
couple of opensource libraries
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://firefly-%20python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;firefly&lt;/a&gt; and

&lt;em&gt;replicability&lt;/em&gt; — the chances other experimenters will achieve a
consistent result[1]- are among the main important beliefs of the
&lt;em&gt;scientific method&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, these two aspects are often underestimated or not even
considered when setting up scientific experimental pipelines. In this,
one of the main threat to replicability is the &lt;em&gt;selection bias&lt;/em&gt; , that
is the error in choosing the individuals or groups to take part in a
study. Selection bias may come in different flavours: the selection of
the population of samples in the dataset ( &lt;em&gt;sample bias&lt;/em&gt; ); the
selection of features used by the learning models, particularly sensible
in case of high dimensionality; the selection of hyper parameter best
performing on specific dataset(s). If not properly considered, the
selection bias may strongly affect the validity of derived conclusions,
as well as the reliability of the learning model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will provide a solid introduction to the topics of
reproducibility and selection bias, with examples taken from the
biomedical research, in which reliability is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a more technological perspective, to date the scientific Python
ecosystem still misses tools to consolidate the experimental pipelines
in in research, that can be used together with Machine and Deep learning
frameworks (e.g. &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sklearn&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;keras&lt;/tt&gt;). In this talk, I will
present &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;reproducible-lern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, a new Python frameworks for reproducible
research to be used for machine and deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk, the main features of the framework will be presented,
along with several examples, technical insights and implementation
choices to be discussed with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is intended for &lt;em&gt;intermediate&lt;/em&gt; PyData researchers and
practitioners. Basic prior knowledge of the main Machine Learning
concepts is assumed for the first part of the talk. On the other hand,
good proficiency with the Python language and with scientific python
libraries (e.g. &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;numpy&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sklearn&lt;/tt&gt;) are required for the second
part.&lt;/p&gt;

labeling is expensive and time consuming. Active Learning is a concept
for building classifiers by letting the algorithm choose the training
data it uses. This achieves greater accuracy than just labeling a random
subset of the available dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The active learning algorithm selects some unlabeled data instances
which are then labeled by a human annotator. Given this information a
classifier is trained and new instances for the human annotator to label
are selected. This iterative process tries to label as few instances as
possible while achieving high classification accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will give a general overview of the core concepts and
techniques of active learning like algorithms for selecting the queries

large &amp;amp; complex model (pipelines), doing these can take up a lot of
time. The traditional way usually includes one beefy machine and a lot
of waiting. In other cases, people tend to “manually” schedule parameter
ranges between nodes, but that can also be problematic since these won't
talk to each other. Kubernetes itself is currently the most prominent
scheduler and shines at distributing task, but is a pretty complex
system in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will show how you can harness the scheduling of
kubernetes for distributing hyperparameter search with sklearn onto a
cluster of nodes. This can be achieved quite easily and with just a few
changes to the original code, so the Data Scientist won't be bothered by
complex kubernetes internals.&lt;/p&gt;

turns out to be difficult with the standard approach of LDA (Latent
Dirichlet Allocation; Blei et al., 2003). Hotel review texts usually
don't differ as much in the topics that are covered as is typical with
other genres such as Wikipedia or newsgroup articles where there is
commonly only a very small set of topics present in each document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, we developed our own approach to topic modeling that is
especially tailored to non-edited texts like hotel reviews. The approach
can be divided into three major steps. First, using the concept of
second-order cooccurrences we define a contextual similarity score that
enables us to identify words that are similar with respect to certain
topics. This score allows us to build up a topic network where nodes are
words and edges the contextual similarity between the words. With the
help of algorithms from graph theory, like the Infomap algorithm
(Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008), we are able to detect clusters of highly
connected words that can be identified as topics in our review texts. In
a further step, we use these clusters and the respective words to get a
topic similarity score for each word in the network. In other words, we
transform a hard clustering of words into topics into a probability
score of how likely a certain word belongs to a given topic/cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

Engineers and beyond. There are a lot of python tools that allow you to
hack together a notebook to quickly get insight on your data, or train a
model to predict or classify. Or you might have inherited some data
wrangling and modeling {Jupyter/Zeppelin} notebook code from someone
else, like the resident data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code works on test data, when you run the cells in the right order
(skipping cell 22), and you believe that the insight gained from this
work would be a valuable game changer. But now how do you take this
experimental code into production, and keep it up-to-date with a regular
retraining schedule? And what do you need to do after that, to ensure
that it remains reliable and brings value in the long term?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will be the questions this talk will answer, focusing on 2 main
themes: What does running an ML model in production involve? How to
improve your development workflow to make the path to production easier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will draw examples from real projects at Yelp, like migrating
a pandas/sklearn classification project into production with pyspark,
while aiming to give advice that is not dependent on specific

Tools to combine the strengths will enable easier collaboration in

presented how Conda environments can be created and used from R. A
further application will be the creation of reports with Markdown and
LaTeX where R and Python can be used within one document and share
objects. A last topic is about showing the possibilities for easier
development in RStudio (help regarding Python functions, auto
completion).&lt;/p&gt;

Python machine learning models for predicting spatiotemporal activities
in cities using location data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing availability of data from cities (e.g., traffic flow, human
mobility and geographical data) opens new opportunities for predicting
and thus optimizing human activities. These may include human mobility,
land use classification, event detection and location recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we characterize the main activity of an area (e.g. Business,
Commercial, Nightlife)?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to detect and forecast unusual spatiotemporal events (e.g.
protest, sport game, concert)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to understand why people are moving between places?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will try to answers these questions explaining how, making use
of Python, it is possible to (i) collect and aggregate geo-located data;
and (ii) build machine learning models to predict spatiotemporal
activities. For example, an unusual activity in a local area at a
specific time can be predicted by analyzing the text from geo-located
tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, we will present an organized picture of geo-located data such
as mobile phone data, geo-located texts from social networks (e.g.
Foursquare and Twitter), census and Open Street Map. Then, we will
briefly discuss how to collect and aggregate such data using Python
packages such as GeoPandas and OSMnx. Finally, we will cover topics
related to cities activities including event detection and forecasting,
human mobility, and location recommendation and prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As location data, we will mostly use samples from Open Street Map and
Foursquare. The example code will make use of (basics) Pandas and
GeoPandas. However, this is a beginner talk and it will be
self-contained as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

routing systems, etc.) it is very often important to be able to predict
what is the most likely next step for the current user. One way of
addressing this issue is using sequence algorithms such as Markov
Chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick introduction to the concept of Markov chains and Markov
processes, we will explore the basics and the implementation of a simple
High Order Markov chain to predict what the most likely next state in a
sequence, based on previous states. We will be using anonymized
real-life data of an automated system and we will try to come up with a
model that can give us the most probable next state using Markov chains
of different orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things we will see in detail: - Mathematics and rationale behind Markov
Chains; - Basic implementation of First Order Markov Chains; -
Implementation of High Order Markov Chains; - Real life application of
the developed model.&lt;/p&gt;

quantify textual data and generate trading signals. Harnessing the power
of alternative data sources became crucial to find novel ways of
enhancing trading strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the proliferation of new data sources, natural language data became
one of the most important data sources which could represent the public
sentiment and opinion about market events, which then can be used to
predict financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk is split into 5 parts;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is a quant and how do they use NLP?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How deep learning has changed NLP?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s get dirty with word embeddings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performant deep learning layer for NLP: The Recurrent Layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using all that to make money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="who-is-a-quant-and-how-do-they-use-nlp"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Who is a quant and how do they use NLP?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quants use mathematical and statistical methods to create algorithmic
trading strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to recent advances in available deep learning frameworks and
datasets (time series, text, video etc) together with decreasing cost of
parallelisable hardware, quants are experimenting with various NLP
methods which are applicable to quantitative trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we will get familiar with the brief history of text
mining work that quants have done so far and recent advancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-deep-learning-has-changed-nlp"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. How deep learning has changed NLP?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, data representation and modeling methods are vastly
improved. For example when it comes to textual data, rather than using
high dimensional sparse matrices and suffering from curse of
dimensionality, distributional vectors are more efficient to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, I will talk about distributional vectors a.k.a. word
embeddings and recent neural network architectures used when building
NLP models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lets-get-dirty-with-word-embeddings"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Let’s get dirty with word embeddings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models such as Word2vec or GloVe helps us create word embeddings from
large unlabeled corpus which represent the relation between words, their
contextual relationships in numerical vector spaces and these
representations not only work for words but also could be used for
phrases and sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, I will talk about inner workings of these models and
important points when creating domain-specific embeddings (e.g. for
sentiment analysis in financial domain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="performant-deep-learning-layer-for-nlp-the-recurrent-layer"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Performant deep learning layer for NLP: The Recurrent Layer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can capture and hold the information
which was seen before (context), which is important for dealing with
unbounded context in NLP tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which is a special type of RNN,
can understand the context even if words have long term dependencies,
words which are far back in their sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will compare LSTMs with other deep learning
architectures and will look at LSTM unit from a technical point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="using-all-that-to-make-money"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Using all that to make money&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial news, especially if it’s major, can change the sentiment among
investors and affect the related asset price with immediate price
corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, what’s been communicated in quarterly earnings calls might
indicate whether the price of share will drop or increase based on the
language used. If the message of the company is not direct and featuring
complex sounding language, it usually indicates that there’s some shady
stuff going on and if this information extracted right, it’s a valuable
trading signal. For similar reasons, scanning announcements and
financial disclosures for trading signals became a common NLP practice
in investment industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, I will talk about the various data sources that
researchers can use and also explain common NLP workflows and deep
learning practices for quantifying textual data for generating trading
signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will end with summary with application architecture in case anyone
would like to implement similar systems for their own use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;replicability&lt;/em&gt; — the chances other experimenters will achieve a
consistent result[1]- are among the main important beliefs of the
&lt;em&gt;scientific method&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, these two aspects are often underestimated or not even
considered when setting up scientific experimental pipelines. In this,
one of the main threat to replicability is the &lt;em&gt;selection bias&lt;/em&gt; , that
is the error in choosing the individuals or groups to take part in a
study. Selection bias may come in different flavours: the selection of
the population of samples in the dataset ( &lt;em&gt;sample bias&lt;/em&gt; ); the
selection of features used by the learning models, particularly sensible
in case of high dimensionality; the selection of hyper parameter best
performing on specific dataset(s). If not properly considered, the
selection bias may strongly affect the validity of derived conclusions,
as well as the reliability of the learning model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will provide a solid introduction to the topics of
reproducibility and selection bias, with examples taken from the
biomedical research, in which reliability is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a more technological perspective, to date the scientific Python
ecosystem still misses tools to consolidate the experimental pipelines
in in research, that can be used together with Machine and Deep learning
frameworks (e.g. &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sklearn&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;keras&lt;/tt&gt;). In this talk, I will
present &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;reproducible-learn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, a new Python frameworks for reproducible
research to be used for machine and deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk, the main features of the framework will be presented,
along with several examples, technical insights and implementation
choices to be discussed with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is intended for &lt;em&gt;intermediate&lt;/em&gt; PyData researchers and
practitioners. Basic prior knowledge of the main Machine Learning
concepts is assumed for the first part of the talk. On the other hand,
good proficiency with the Python language and with scientific python
libraries (e.g. &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;numpy&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sklearn&lt;/tt&gt;) are required for the second
part.&lt;/p&gt;

disbelief. That was the final straw for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created a bot persona who uses Machine Learning to analyze public

we use the internet publicize our findings and icing on it was to use
Twitter to directly engage the public and politicians under the topic of
suspicious expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

we can take a look in some tweets from Rosie, the robot, and how some
politicians are now vociferating with a ROBOT on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that
can be counted counts. A. Einstein&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are routinely asked to evaluate the performance of other
individuals, separating success from failure and affecting outcomes from
science to education and sports. Yet, little is known about the aspects
that determine the human perception of performance. How do expert
reviewers, as well as ordinary people, arrive to their evaluations? To
what extent these evaluations are based on objective performance
features? How are they affected by subjective biases or contextual
influences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will answer these fascinating questions focusing on &lt;em&gt;soccer&lt;/em&gt; ,
the most popular sport in the world. Firstly, we will show how machine
learning can accurately reproduce the mechanisms human judges use to
evaluate the performance of soccer players, uncovering limits and
characteristics of the human evaluation process. Second, we design a
Python package that allows, in a completely unsupervised and data-driven
way, to (i) evaluate the quality of a player’s performance and (ii) rank
soccer players based on their performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the talk will show how soccer ratings assigned to
every player of a game by sport-specialized newspapers are associated
with a high- dimensional vector of features extracted by massive data
which describe any quantifiable aspects of soccer games. The talk will
show how, by using Scikit- learn, we can train an &lt;em&gt;artificial judge&lt;/em&gt;
which learns the relation between technical performance and soccer
ratings, hence &lt;em&gt;accurately reproducing&lt;/em&gt; the human evaluation process. By
inspecting the structure of the artificial judge, the talk will show
that the human evaluation criteria follow a simplistic cognitive process
based on a simple heuristic: judges first select a limited number of
features which attract their attention and then rate a performance based
on the presence of noticeable values, i.e., features values far from the
norm that can be easily brought to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the talk will show how to overcome the simplicity of
the human evaluation process presenting &lt;strong&gt;PlayeRank&lt;/strong&gt; , a Python package
which implements an unsupervised data-driven framework to evaluate the
performance of soccer players in the main European leagues. The talk
will show how to use PlayeRank to construct a data-driven ranking of
players and highlight the factors which determine why celebrated
players, like Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, actually result to be the top
players in the world. The modules composing PlayeRank will be presented,
showing how they allow the user to define the features characterizing a
performance, to detect in an automatic way the relevance of each
player’s action to a game outcome, to detect the role of a player given
his game data, to rate every performance as well as to obtain a final
ranking of all players in Europe. A short demo will be provided during
the talk through a Jupyter notebook, exploiting interactive data
visualization with the Bokeh package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience will learn how to use Python to construct evaluation
algorithms entirely based on machine learning and big data, a step
forward to a thorough and objective evaluation of performance which
overcomes the biases and the limitations of human perception of
performance. Just a basic knowledge of Python and of data mining
principles is required for a full understanding of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

With some basic black magic trickery (statistics) we can then draw conclusions about effectiveness of the marketing intervention.

&lt;p&gt;I studied Mathematics and Bioinformatics in Bonn and Tübingen and I am a core developer of pymc3 since Feb 2017. Currently, I work for Quantopian on the development of Bayesian Methods for portfolio allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyMC3 allows you to build statistical models for a wide range of datasets, use those models to estimate underlying parameters, and compute the uncertainty about those parameters. In this talk I will try to give a gentle introduction to PyMC3, and help avoid common pitfalls for new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the problems that are discussed in the context of the reproducibility crisis in science and statistics can be solved or alleviated by tools like PyMC3 or Stan. They allow users to build much more realistic models and get a full distribution of the possible values for parameters as output – instead of p-values that are often hard to interpret correctly. Thanks to Hamiltonian and Variational methods, they are more flexible and can be applied to larger problems than predecessors like JAGS and BUGS. However, these new methods also come with challenges. Writing good models isn't easy, and when inference algorithms cry out in pain, they need someone who listens to them. This talk uses some real-world applications to give an introduction to PyMC3, without requiring a lot of background in math, statistics or programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the industry understands the importance of Data Science for transforming businesses an interesting trend is arising. We have started seeing a widening gap &amp;amp; increasing difficulty to move teams from Proof of Concepts to Production. Apart from searching for the best data scientists, the industry is now looking for answers to organize &amp;amp; federate the data teams around practical business use cases. In this talk, Yasir Khan will provide an overview of the bottlenecks, and hurdles involved in a practical data project. While citing lessons learned from industry, this presentation will focus on important aspects such as business centric, data culture, data pipelines, organization, methodology &amp;amp; tools all of which are important but seldom ignored in large corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state-of-the-art in image classification has skyrocketed thanks to the development of deep convolutional neural networks and increases in the amount of data and computing power available to train them. The top-5 error rate in the ImageNet competition to predict which of 1000 classes an image belongs to has plummeted from 28% error in 2010 to just 2.25% in 2017 (human level error is around 5%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to classify objects in images (including not hotdogs), deep learning can be used to automatically generate captions for images, convert photos into paintings, detect cancer in pathology slide images, and help self-driving cars ‘see’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will give an overview of the cutting edge and some of the core mathematical concepts and will also include a short code-first tutorial to show how easy it is to get started using deep learning for computer vision in python…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is a crash course on convolutional neural networks and how to use them to solve 2 real-world applications at scale. The first is an image moderation system and the second is a visual similarity system where a user uploads an image of an item and the system returns visually similar items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scikit-Learn is built directly over numpy, Python's numerical array library. Pandas adds to numpy metadata and higher-level munging capabilities. This talk describes how to intelligently auto-wrap Scikit-Learn for creating a version that can leverage pandas's added features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scikit-Learn is the de-facto standard Python library for general-purpose machine learning. It operates over NumPy, an efficient, but low-level, homogeneic array library. Pandas adds to NumPy metadata, heterogeneity, and higher-leve munging capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of visualization, newer generation libraries, e.g., Seaborn and Bokeh, are providing safer, more readable, and higher-level functionality, by operating over Pandas data structures. Some of these are implemented using Matplotlib, a lower-level NumPy-based plotting library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk describes a library for a Pandas-based version of sickit-learn. Here, too, giving a Pandas interface to a machine-learning library, provides code which is safer to use, more readable, and allows direct integration with Pandas's higher-level munging capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the large-scale, and evolving nature, of sicikit-learn's codebase, it is infeasible to manually wrap it. Except for a small number of intentional deviations from sickit-learn, the library wraps Scikit-Learn modules lazily through module and class introspection, and dynamic module loading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a short review of the relevant points of Pandas and Scikit-Learn, the talk is roughly divided into two aspects:     Scikit-Learn And Pandas User Perspective     Safety Advantages Of Pandas-Based Estimators     Using Metadata For Inter-Instance Aggregated Features And Cross-Validation     Using Metadata For Advanced Meta-Algorithms: Stacking, Nested Labeled And Stratified Cross-Valdiation     Python Develop Perspective     Unique Challenges Of Scikit-Learn Introspection And Decoration     Two Approaches For Wrapping Scikit-Learn Estimators     Lazy Dynamic Module Loading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science teams working on real-world prescriptive analytics applications face the challenge to design, build and maintain considerably complex machine learning pipelines on a daily basis. Such pipelines include parsing data from multiple data sources, extracting relevant predictive features, executing training, validation, prediction steps and finally optimizing actions to meet desired business outcome so that they can be shared and visualized to business users. In this talk, we demonstrate how such pipelines can be implemented end-to-end in a robust, scalable and extensible manner using Python, Luigi, PySpark and scikit-learn. We will share our lessons learned from using this framework in a real-world demand forecasting use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revolution-in-waiting for user experience is conversational AI, and this revolution should be available to everyone. The ability to communicate with your computer via a fulfilling and useful conversation will change the way we approach user interaction. Recent advances in machine learning have made this goal not only possible to reach, but possible to bring to the developer community at large. At Rasa we have developed a set of open-source Python libraries which can comprehend natural language and handle complex, interesting conversations. We utilise deep learning to bypass existing rigid conversational norms (state machines, if/else statements, etc.) and allow developers to make awesome bots simply by talking to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern neural networks consist of hundreds of computation layers! These very deep architectures consistently outperform shallower networks in a variety of tasks. However just simply stacking layers on top of each other won't work because the gradients are either vanishing or exploding during optimisation procedure. This talk explains the exciting math, cool ideas and elegant code that modern neural network architectures such as ResNets, HighwayNets and DenseNets are applying to circumvent the problem using PyTorch. PyTorch is a relatively new deep learning framework that is deeply integrated into Python. Unlike other frameworks such as TensorFlow and Theano, it uses tape-based automatic differentiation to run computation immediately, supports dynamic neural networks and provides a powerful GPU-accelerated Tensor library. The talk concludes with some real-world use-cases for very deep neural networks in chemical-genetic profiling and autonomous driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Scientist working on predictive analytics with data from pipeline inspection measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will show how we use real and synthetic data to create successful models for risk assessing pipeline anomalies. The main focus is the estimation of the difference in the statistical properties of real and generated data by machine learning methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROSEN provides predictive analytics for pipelines by detecting and risk assessing anomalies from data gathered by inline inspection measurement devices. Due to budget reasons (pipelines need to be dug up to get acess) ground truth data for machine learning applications in this field are usually scarce, imbalanced and not available for all existing configurations of measurement devices. This creates the need for synthetic data (using FEM simulations and unsupervised learning algorithms) in order to be able to create successful models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a naive mixture of real-world and synthetic samples in a model does not necessarily yield to an increased predictive performance because of differences in the statistical distributions in feature space. I will show how we evaluate the use of synthetic data besides simple visual inspection. Manifold learning (e.g. TSNE) can be used to gain an insight whether real and generated data are inherently different.
Quantitative approaches like classifiers trained to discriminate between these types of data provide a non visual insight whether a &amp;quot;synthetic gap&amp;quot; in the feature distributions exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the synthetic data is useful for model building careful considerations have to be applied when constructing cross validation folds and test sets to prevent biased estimates of the model performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heidi graduated with Honors in Chemistry from the University of Leeds before taking up a position as an Industrial Chemist with ICI (ORICA). This led to a career in software development working in UK, Aus and USA. In 2000 she became an author by the publication by Addison Wesley of Oracle8i tuning and administration: the essential reference ASIN: B007EIZGOG this was a sales success and translated into German. In her spare time she uses python to write software that allows her to train object classifiers to steal mens' mustaches and put them on the face of Taylor Swift. For this talk she will give a simple introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks using learned &amp;quot;mustache-ness&amp;quot; as an example, implemented with existing python modules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyconAu 2016 and PyconHK 2016 is her speaking experience &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70JAm03IBFI"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70JAm03IBFI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of neural networks which are powerful and flexible tools. A common application is image generation. I would like to give a simple introduction to GANs using existing python modules and an example of how &amp;quot;mustache-ness&amp;quot; can be learned and applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective is to showcase the power and flexibility of combining preexisting python modules and applying them to the field of image processing and machine learning. Learning what constitutes &amp;quot;Mustache-ness&amp;quot; in a straight forward and fun example of applying the technology in a 30 min presentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn tips on image processing, as well as training their own neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analogy can be considered as a relation between forger and detective. The task of the forger is to create fake examples of original paintings by famous artists. If the fake can pass as an original the the forger can exchange the fake for money. The task of the detective is to catch the forgers. He does this by knowing what are the properties that set the original artist apart and what sort of picture he would create. The detective uses this knowledge to determine whether or not the image is real or fake. From an introduction of what a Generative Adversarial Network is, how they work and how they can be used to generate fake images of mustaches by determining what constitutes &amp;quot;mustache-ness&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn that there are two main components of a GAN – Generator Neural Network and Discriminator Neural Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Generator Network takes an random input and tries to generate a sample of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It then generates data which is subsequently fed into a discriminator network D(x). The task of Discriminator Network is to take input either from the real data or from the generator and try to predict whether the input is real or generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D(x) solves a binary classification problem using sigmoid function giving output in the range 0 to 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn how to define the problem. Do you want to generate fake images or fake text. Having defined the problem you can then collect data for it. You will define how your GAN should look. In our example of &amp;quot;mustache-ness&amp;quot; you will choose a convolutional neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will see the effect of training the Discriminator on real data for n epochs. Using examples of real mustaches we will generate fake ones. We will see generated fake inputs for the generator and the effect of training the discriminator on fake data. The discriminator will correctly predict them as fake. Subsequently we will see how to train the generator with the output of discriminator. Now we can see a trained generator that can fool the discriminator. Generating fake mustaches that are indistinguishable from real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn tips on image processing, as well as training your own convolutional neural network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showcasing the power of python in a fun, lighthearted way. Hopefully, being informative and entertaining&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Python Ecosystem for Data Science: A Guided Tour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is on its way to becoming the lingua franca of data science, and Pythonistas have access to an impressive and extensive collection of tools for data analysis. Here, a data scientist needs to see the forest for the trees: The space of tools is best understood as an ecosystem, where libraries build upon each other, and where a good library fills an ecological niche by doing certain jobs well. This talk is a guided tour of the Python data science ecosystem. More than a list of libraries, it aims to provide some structure, classing tools by type of data, size of data, and type of analysis. In our tour, we visit a number of areas, including working with tabular data (numpy, pandas, dask, ...) and graph data (e.g. networkx), statistics (e.g. statsmodels), machine learning (scikit-learn, ...), data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, ...). Aspiring data scientists, and everyone else working with data, should find this useful for selecting the right tools for their next data-driven project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I am doing my PhD in Particle Physics - which mainly involves development of software in a large collaboration. I love working with Python and C++ to process large amounts of data. Of course it needs to be processed as quickly as possible. I am working on the core reconstruction algorithms for our experiment, which are steered and controlled using Python. Apart from that, I was working as a Data Science Engineer for Blue Yonder, a leading machine learning company, where the idea for tsfresh was born. I am still heavily involved in the project. When I am not writing code, I am updating myself on the newest technical geek stuff (mostly cloud computing and deep learning) or play the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought about developing a time series model to predict stock prices? Or do you consider log time series from the operation of cloud resources as being more compelling? In this case you really should consider using the time series feature extraction package tsfresh for your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, and precision medicine are driven by the availability of cheap sensors and advancing connectivity, which among others increases the availability of temporally annotated data. The resulting time series are the basis for manifold machine learning applications. Examples are the classification of hard drives into risk classes concerning specific defect, the log analysis of server farms for detecting intruders, or regression tasks like the prediction of the remaining lifespan of machinery. Tsfresh also allows to easily setup a machine learning pipeline that predicts stock prices, which we will demonstrate live during the presentation ;). The problem of extracting and selecting relevant features for classification or regression is these domains is especially hard to solve, if each label or regression target is associated with several time series and meta-information simultaneously – which is a common pattern in industrial applications. This talk introduces a distributed and parallel feature extraction and selection algorithm – the recently published Python library tsfresh. The fully automated extraction and importance selection does not only allow to reach better machine learning classification scores, but in combination with the speed of the package, also allows to incorporate tsfresh into automated AI-pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

network comparison and the classification tasks by introducing the
glocal HIM metric for comparing graphs and a graph kernel induced by the
HIM measure. The HIM distance is defined as the one-parameter family of
product metrics linearly combining the normalised Hamming distance H and
the normalised Ipsen- Mikhailov spectral distance IM. The combination of
the two components within a single metric allows overcoming their
drawbacks and obtaining a measure which is simultaneously global and
local. Furthermore, plugging the HIM kernel into a Support Vector
Machine gives us a classification algorithm based on the HIM distance.
Here we outline the underlying theoretical details of the metric
construction, and we present several applications of the HIM distance
and the HIM kernel to datasets belonging to different areas, including
socioeconomics, neuroscience, oncogenomics and developmental genomics,
supporting the adoption of the HIM family as a general analysis tool for
information extraction based on a quantitative evaluation of the
difference among diverse instances of a complex system. We conclude
introducing the Open Source implementation of the HIM metrics provided
in the R package nettols and in its web interface ReNette.&lt;/p&gt;

amounts of multidimensional data. Data sources from sensor networks and
Internet-of-Things applications promise a wealth of interaction data
that can be naturally represented as tensors. Tensor decompositions have
gained a steadily increasing popularity in data mining and machine
learning, with applications in psychometrics, chemometrics, signal
processing, computer vision, neuroscience, graph analysis, and more. For
example, time-varying social networks collected from wearable proximity
sensors can be represented as 3-way tensors, and tensor decomposition
can be used to extract community structures with their structural and
temporal signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current standard framework for working with tensors, however, is
Matlab. We will show how tensor decompositions can be carried out using
Python, how to obtain latent components and how they can be interpreted,
and what are some applications of this technique in the academy and
industry. We will see a use case where a Python implementation of tensor
decomposition is applied to a dataset that describes face-to-face social
interactions of people, collected using the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sociopatterns.org/"&gt;SocioPatterns&lt;/a&gt; platform. This
platform was deployed in different settings such as conferences, schools
and hospitals, in order to support mathematical modelling and simulation
of airborne infectious diseases. Tensor decomposition has been used in
these scenarios to solve different types of problems: it is used for
data cleaning, where time-varying graph anomalies can be identified and
removed from data; it have been also used to assess the impact of
face-to-face interactions in the spreading of diseases. These examples
show the potential of this technique in data mining and machine learning
applications.&lt;/p&gt;

applicazioni analitiche odierne. In questo talk l’attenzione verte sul
problema del &lt;strong&gt;NILM&lt;/strong&gt; (Not Intrusive Load Monitoring) per cui
l’obiettivo è la disaggregazione real-time dei consumi di energia
elettrica. Gli algoritmi, permettono di riconoscere in realtime i
dispositivi attivi in base alle sole caratteristiche del segnale
aggregato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L’obiettivo del talk è dimostrare come sia possibile implementare
rapidamente un prototipo hardware e software grazie alle potenzialità di
Arduino e Python rispettivamente.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Con degli &lt;em&gt;esempi hardware e software pratici&lt;/em&gt; (4 devices collegati ad
una multipresa), verrà dimostrata la capacità di Arduino di acquisire le
misura di corrente elettrica e la capacità di Python di riconoscere i
dispositivi attivi. Verranno fornite informazioni sulle logiche alla
base di tali algoritmi, con riferimento all’ecosistema Python e alle
relative librerie utilizzate.&lt;/p&gt;

that you’re asked at least once to explain what actually means &lt;strong&gt;Deep
Learning&lt;/strong&gt; , and what’s all the fuss about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, answering this question in a proper way, may vary (and it has
to) depending on the kind of audience you’ve been talking to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are talking to a machine learning experts, you have to
concentrate on what &lt;em&gt;deep&lt;/em&gt; means, for the multiple learning models you
can come up with. Most importarly, you have to convince them that a deep
learning model would work by far better than a more standard and robust
Random Forest or Support Vector Machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if your audience is made up of engineers, they
[STRIKEOUT:don’t give a damn..] are definitely more interested in how
you implement your Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) rather than
understanding what are the implications of different &lt;em&gt;activations&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;optimizers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if your audience is made up of data scientists - who are a good
mixture of the previous two, according to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram"&gt;Drew
Conway&lt;/a&gt;
- they are more or less interested in both the two aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other way, that is the &lt;em&gt;unconventional way&lt;/em&gt;, to explain what Deep
Learning means, is from the perspective of the computational model it
requires to be properly effective. Therefore, you may want to talk about
ANN in terms of matrix multiplications algorithms, running on a (series
of) GPUs in parallel. And this is &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; the perspecitve I intend
to pursue in this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for PyData scientists who are interested in understanding
Deep Learning models from this unconventional perspective, learning what
are the libraries and tools they may leverage for their experiments on
GPUs. Experienced engineers may likely benefit from this talk as well,
learning how they can make their models run fast(er).&lt;/p&gt;

mobility and related challenges. Then, we will briefly show how to deal
in Python with geo- mobility dataset and finally, we will go trough the
recent advances in machine learning and deep learning in the context
