&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Integrating Design and Development teams by implementing a Design System&amp;quot; by Mariana Bedran Lesche, Daniela Falcone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the software industry, developers, designers and stakeholders should be working together to achieve the same goals and deliver high quality products to the final users. To be actually able to work together in an efficient and harmonic way, though, is a whole other thing. In a team composed by developers and designers, we were able to mitigate the impact of communication flaws and concepts divergences in a continuous effort to cover the blank spots we found on every iteration we went through. In this talk, we're going to share some lessons learned about how to integrate both teams’ work with a solid management process.&lt;/p&gt;
