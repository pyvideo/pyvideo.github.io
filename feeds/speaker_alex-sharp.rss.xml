&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dealing with big data isn't a particularly new problem. There are all
sorts of new solutions, each with their own niche, their own hype. It's
important to remember that python is not &amp;quot;too slow&amp;quot; for big data, and
that with projects such as scipy, numpy, cython and rpy, python is
becoming a better tool then ever for data processing. In this talk we'll
be explaining some of the theory behind big data problems, where python
