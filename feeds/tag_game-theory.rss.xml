In this lecture we show how to create games and strategies and test or improve them. We'll start out very simply, with easy strategies for the prisoner's dilemma, and work our way up to using evolutionary heuristics to find optimal strategies for complex situations. It's an incredibly cool use of Python, and most people don't realize how easy it is to create things that sound relatively complex.&lt;/p&gt;
