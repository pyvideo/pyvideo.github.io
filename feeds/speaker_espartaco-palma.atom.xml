how Paradigm Shift from Producer Innovation to User and Open
Collaborative Innovation, this can be true not only on products, also in
how the users can produce innovation on service like the OpenData &amp;amp; Open
Government, don't need the main publisher, researcher or Government
provide all the work. The communities can push more innovation around
this new services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, everybody can improve the data available, curate, create,
publish and provide more value on public &amp;amp; open data. Learn a framework
like Flask is more accessible than ever, host &amp;amp; publish REST services
for free, host the code of project for free also. It's democratizing all
the way. All can be done with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I'll demonstrate how can use GitHub to publish a
data sets (and proper updates) and the code of the Python REST API with
no more than 100 lines of code which can be deployed on local
installation, plus, with few commands, deploy on a service with a free
tier like OpenShift for a worldwide audience.&lt;/p&gt;
