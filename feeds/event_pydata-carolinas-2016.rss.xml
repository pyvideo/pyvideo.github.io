combine models developed by multiple analysts for distinct subsets of
a large feature space. We apply the framework to retail sales data,
but its design can accommodate other types of target variables. This
is a novel application of ensemble learning since it addresses both
analytical and organizational challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

their Python implementations to build AI's that can play LaserCat, a
video game written with Pygame. We start with building an imitation AI
that can imitate a human player's decision-making. Then we build a
self-evolving AI that can explore and learn on its own to eventually
achieve super-human level.&lt;/p&gt;

to allow for data normalization across dynamic environments. We
applied these techniques to subjects viewing artwork at Duke’s Nasher
Museum of Art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most eye tracking solutions track gaze with respect to a static object
like a computer screen, making it easy to know exactly where a person
is looking with respect to an image on the screen. This makes analysis
easier, but doesn’t accurately reflect real-life. What happens when we
move eye tracking into a more realistic, dynamic setting, using eye
tracking glasses that allow people to move around? People can interact
with objects in a much more natural manner, but a new challenge is
introduced: We only have gaze data with respect to the glasses frame
of reference. In order to apply conventional analysis methods to these
data, we need to map dynamic gaze back onto a static reference image,
compensating for distance, head movement, and perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the OpenCV package and its efficient implementations of common
computer vision algorithms, we developed a method to find objects of
interest in video from eye tracking glasses and return gaze
coordinates over those objects, enabling experimenters to apply
conventional data analysis methods to eye tracking behavior obtained
in dynamic, real-world situations.&lt;/p&gt;

write the request, who to send it to and tactics for getting
compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy democracy depends on open information so that both the
public and officials can participate in making good decisions. But a
great deal of information is essentially hidden from public view, held
in government databases that regular citizens can’t access. Even the
public officials who have access are often not fully aware of what
their data might show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does a developer get access to that information, in hopes of
shedding light on how government does or does not serve the needs of
citizens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recognition of the substantial and growing impact of big data to
the U.S., across sectors, in 2012 the White House launched a multi-
agency research initiative to foster and coordinate big data
innovation across the US. Under this initiative, the National
Foundation launched four Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs, new
organizations intended to develop the Big Data innovation ecosystem
and facilitate thematic communities’ use of data sciences for societal
benefit. Specifically, the Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs
accelerate partnerships among people in business, academia, and
government who apply data science and analytics to help solve regional
and national challenges. The Big Data Hubs cover all 50 states and
currently include several hundred universities, corporations, federal
agencies, and non-governmental organizations. Dr. Shanley will
introduce the Big Data Hubs and report on some of the significant
activities of the South Big Data Innovation Hub. Finally, she will
discuss opportunities to engage with the Big Data Hubs and our growing
networks of Public/Private partnerships. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://southbigdatahub.org"&gt;http://southbigdatahub.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They
allow us to conduct complex analysis and implement cutting-edge
machine learning models simply and easily. However after the initial
model fitting a common challenge often arises - how do we put these
models in production ensuring that it fits into a larger
organizational architecture? In this talk we outline the various
strateg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PyData stack offers a remarkably powerful toolkit for building
complex machine learning and analytical components quickly. However,
machine learning doesn't happen in a vacuum. It is part a large system
of enterprise software responsible for data processing and must play-
well with other tools in the ecosystem. In order to get the benefits
of rapid development while not sacrificing the non-functional
requirements, MaxPoint as implemented and tested multiple deployment
models for software relying on the PyData stack. This talk we walk
through these various deployment models and discuss the trade-offs of
the approach.&lt;/p&gt;

geospatial data using Spark, Impala, and Python. We use this framework
to join billions of device locations daily from mobile phone users to
millions of points of interest. We discuss our project structure and
workflow. Our work has broader application to movement of populations
through time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large-scale geospatial data is a common analytical challenge. We
receive billions of location data points per day for user locations.
We need to filter this data and map it to millions of points of
interest. Our end use case is to provide clients with information as
to the attributes of users who visit their stores. This workflow,
however, has application to the broader analytical problem of mapping
geospatially located entities of interest to points of interest with
known locations. We also provide our approach to the frequently
encountered issue of needing both standardized and flexible reporting.
We have automated the standard analyses in our workflow, but created
an API for analysts to quickly develop ad-hoc analyses based on
customer requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are freely available tools to the Python user that can help us
complete all of the tasks in our data analysis pipeline. At a high
level, the architecture of our process is as follows: HDFS storage for
large-scale geospatial data, Spark for geospatial joins, Cloudera
Impala accessed via Ibis to query resultant datasets, and scientific
python for conducting analyses. We make the automated analyses to the
end users via a web portal created using Flask and Celery. We created
an API available to analysts as a Python package so that they can
quickly perform custom analyses created by clients. We used Sphinx to
aid in documentation for easier use of the API.&lt;/p&gt;

machine learning but can suffer as their complexity increases. By
embedding time as a structural element rather than a property, we will
explore how time series and interactive analysis can be improved on
Graph structures. Primarily we will look at decomposition in NLP-
extracted concept graphs using NetworkX and Graph Tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modeling data as networks of relationships between entities can be a
powerful method for both visual analytics and machine learning; people
are very good at distinguishing patterns from interconnected
structures, and machine learning methods get a performance improvement
when applied to graph data structures. However, as these structures
become more complex or embed more information over time, both visual
and algorithmic methods get messy; visual analyses suffer from the
&amp;quot;hairball&amp;quot; effect, and graph algorithms require either more traversal
or increased computation at each vertex. A growing area to reduce this
complexity and optimize analytics is the use of interactive and
subgraph techniques that model how graph structures change over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recurrent neural networks have recently achieved spectacular results
in many different natural language processing tasks, but their utility
in more practical applications is largely undocumented. For companies
that follow a subscription business model, sequential data can often
be found in abundance, seemingly making recurrent neural networks a
perfect fit for many prediction tasks. Unfortunately, resources
describing how to leverage the power of recurrent neural networks in
non-language settings are generally lacking. At Red Hat, we’re using
recurrent neural networks to tackle a number of different business
goals, including predicting customer churn and prioritizing support
cases. During this talk, you’ll learn about Red Hat’s full deep
learning pipeline, from data collection (e.g., mining website logs on
Hadoop clusters and pulling data from SQL databases), to data
preprocessing (e.g., dimensionality reduction in scikit-learn), to
prediction. By the end, you’ll have the foundation necessary to begin
implementing your own recurrent neural network solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

which are the most the most influential cases in our legal system? Can
we understand how legal doctrine evolves? Using tools from network
statistics and data provided by Court Listener (an open legal data
project), we analyze the network of law case citations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citation networks have recently been a topic of interest to network
scientists. Court Listener, an open data initiative, provides the
network of law case citations as well as the text of (almost every)
court case in the US. This network data set provides a rich array of
questions that are of interest to legal scholars as well as network
scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we determine which cases are the most influential in our legal
system? Can we understand how legal doctrine evolves? We will discuss
what we learned about how the network of law cases evolves and what
this means for legal practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by this data set we develop new statistical methodology to
model how networks evolve. We also provide new techniques to asses the
goodness of fit for both standard and novel probabilistic network

generator for CPython C extensions. It provides better support for
additional compilers, build systems, cross compilation, and locating
dependencies and determining their build requirements. We also
describe how Matplotlib and SymEngine are updated to make use of
&amp;quot;scikit-build&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the scientific packages NumPy, SciPy, SymEngine or Matplotlib
can be used from Python today, since they bundle C, C++ or Fortan
extensions, successfully building the associated binary wheels is
complex and prone to errors. This is a significant barrier to allow
use of these scientific packages on a broader set of platforms like
mobile, Raspberry Pi or HPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To facilitate the build process, the scikit-build package is
fundamentally just glue between the setuptools Python module and
CMake. Currently, the package is available to perform builds in a
setup.py file. In the future, the project aims to be a build tool
option in the currently developing pyproject.toml build system
specification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python makes it easy to create small programs to handle all kinds of
tasks, and tools like Github make it easy and free to share code with
the world. However, simply adding a *.py to a Github repository (or
worse: a zip file on your personal website) doesn't mean other Python
programmers will be able to run and use your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I've written one-off scripts and small programs to automate
personal tasks and satisfy my curiosity. Until recently, I was never
comfortable sharing this code online. In this talk, I will share good
practices I've learned and developed for sharing my small projects
online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will include tips on writing reusable scripts, the basics of
Git and Github, the importance of READMEs and software licenses, and
creation of reproducible Python environments with Conda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides making your code more usable and accessible to others, the
tips in this talk will help you make your Github profile a valuable

operations informed by data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various data sources such as application logs, system metrics, and
project management systems are used every day by Cloudant engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I'll describe how DevOps works at Cloudant, and how data is used
to meet our service needs. Break through the buzzwords and see the
reality of a running service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll demonstrate a data processing engine called Forecast, which
combines various sources at Cloudant for analysis. Forecast allows
engineers to go beyond manual inspection by using Pandas and NumPy to
analyze information. We'll see how we can realize new insights from
our service metrics with tooling and automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we'll examine data using Jupyter Notebooks as provided by IBM

programming language. Rather than treat testing as a “necessary evil,”
Python offers a number of versatile test frameworks to make it fun and

a few of the popular frameworks, including unittest, doctest, py.test,
Nose, and Avocado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing is vital to the success of any software, including big data
and analytics code. Unfortunately, it is often regarded as a
“necessary evil” – extra work that slows down progress. In this
session, I will highlight how testing in Python can be fun, easy,
fast, and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I will give a brief overview of basic best practices for
testing. We will talk about the difference between debugging and
testing, different types of tests, how to write good test cases, and
basic testing fixtures like assertions and results. I will focus on
unit testing, but the concepts can be applied to higher levels of
testing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, for the majority of the session, I will introduce different
Python test frameworks: - unittest as the standard module for unit
test classes. - doctest as a lightweight way to write short, self-
documenting assertions in docstrings. - py.test as a way to write very
concise test cases. - Nose as an extension of unittest with added
features. - Avocado as a comprehensive framework with parameters,
replay, and test discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is designed to be useful to Python programmers of any skill
level. Only a basic understanding of Python is required.&lt;/p&gt;

set like Python and scientific computing. We’ll show how we are
simplifying the learning experience for novice data scientists using
Vagrant and Ansible to provision reproducible computing environments
for use in our Summer of Open Science workshop series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern research practice asks researchers to engage with information
in new ways through the use of digital technologies. The landscape of
this skillset is rapidly changing and difficult to pinpoint at an
interdisciplinary level. The modern researcher is expected to navigate
digital tools that are not unique to the work that they do on a daily
basis within their discipline and to be able to share that work in
meaningful ways with collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open science has become increasingly relevant to modern scientific
practice and reflects the development of the modern research skill
set. There is a rising tide of policy that requires researchers to
navigate open methodology in order to gain access to grant funding.
Despite a shift towards support of open science in major policy making
bodies, such as the OECD, the training that early career researchers
receive has not caught up with this fast changing policy landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

entities represented by our data, creatively conceptualizing different
perspectives from which our data can be analyzed, and then bringing
those conceptualizations to life with the help of Python libraries
such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, and Yellowbrick so that we can
unlock the latent value and insights hidden in our data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of data analysis, there lies a need to understand the
real world entities being represented in the data. Every data set we
encounter is an attempt to capture a slice of our complex world and
communicate some information about it in a way that has potential to
be informative to humans, machines, or both. Moving from basic
analyses to advanced analytics requires the ability to imagine
multiple ways of conceptualizing the composition of entities and the
relationships present in our data. It also requires the realization
that different levels of aggregation, disaggregation, and
transformation can open up new pathways to understanding our data and
identifying the valuable insights it contains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll discuss several ways to think about the
composition and representation of our data. We’ll also demonstrate a
series of methods that leverage tools like networks, hierarchical
aggregations, and unsupervised clustering to visually explore our
data, transform it to discover new insights, help frame analytical
problems and questions, and even improve machine learning model
performance. In exploring these approaches, and with the help of
Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, and
Yellowbrick, we will provide a practical framework for thinking

discover insight from connected entities. In this tutorial, you will
learn how to use the NetworkX library to analyze network data in
Python, emphasizing intuition over theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods will be illustrated using a dataset of the romantic
relationships between characters on &amp;quot;Grey's Anatomy&amp;quot;, an American
medical drama on the ABC television network. Analysis and intuition
will be emphasized over theory and mathematical rigor. An
IPython/Jupyter notebook format will be used as we code through the
examples together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jupyter is a great notebook environment for Python based data science
and exploratory data analysis. You can share the notebooks via a
github repository, as html or even on the web using something like
JupyterHub. How can we turn the work we have done in the notebook into
a real web application?&lt;/p&gt;

but have yet to make their way into mainstream usage in a number of
popular fields. Recent advances in question-answering have come
largely from creative applications of deep learning. In this tutorial,
I will demonstrate how to modify the open-source framework Keras to
build some of these models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question answering has received more focus as large search engines
have basically mastered general information retrieval and are starting
to cover more edge cases. Question answering happens to be one of
those edge cases, because it could involve a lot of syntatic nuance
that doesn’t get captured by standard information retrieval models,
like BM-25 or LSI. Hypothetically, deep learning models are better
suited to this type of task because of their ability to capture
higher-order syntax. Two papers, “Applying deep learning to answer
selection: a study and an open task” (Feng et. al. 2015) and “LSTM-
based deep learning models for non-factoid answer selection” (Tan et.
al. 2016), are recent examples which have applied deep learning to
question-answering tasks with good results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feng et. al. used an in-house Java framework for their work, and Tan
et. al. built their model entirely from Theano. This tutorial will
demonstrate how to replicate the models used by each group using the
popular open-source framework Keras, adding custom functions to
include recent advances from the neural networks community.&lt;/p&gt;

graphics. The focus will be on R Shiny, but I will also summarize
value of other options, such as leaflet, plotly, ggvis, and rCharts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With interactive and reactive data visualizations, your audience
directly engages with your data for stronger communication and better
understanding. The Shiny apps can easily be launched directly to the
web via shinyapps.io or Shiny Server to be run by anyone (they don't
need to download your data or have R). This course assumes
participants can already perform data analysis and visualization in R,
but want to expand their skills with R Shiny. Therefore, the class
exercises focus on transcribing code from a static to an interactive
presentation of data products and information. Students must bring
their own laptop with a current version of R and R Studio. Outline: -
Overview of available interactive tools in R - Exercise to build a
simple Shiny app - Shiny setup and orientation - Introduction to Shiny
code structure - Overview of basic widgets - Example of conditional
reactivity&lt;/p&gt;

evolving, and best practices are not yet widespread. This tutorial
will introduce the Julia language, with a focus on two key areas —
multiple dispatch and the type system — that often trip up users
coming from dynamic languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop will introduce the Julia language to those coming from a

Pandas library. The tutorial is meant for absolute beginners to Pandas
and Python as a programming language. We will begin with loading
tabular data and various ways to calculate summary statistics and
visualize data. Next, we will learn various ways to join multiple
datasets, and how we can work with missing values etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the tutorial is to expose users to Pandas for data
analysis and move users into a more reproducible analysis workflow
compared to spreadsheet programs. The tutorial will begin with loading
in tabular data and various ways to view columns and rows of data. The
initial part of the tutorial will show users how to load in data and
quickly create descriptive statistical plots. Next, we will cover more
of pandas internal data structures. This will cover some fundamental
knowledge about Python as a programming language, mainly object
methods. Finally, before showing users basic data cleaning examples,
we will cover data visualizations using matplotlib, seaborn, and
pandas itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next section of the tutorial will show learners how to assemble
and merge multiple datasets, and how to work with missing values.
Lastly, before we get to fitting models, I will go over how to recode
variables for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main purpose is to show users how to use Pandas, and not how to
fit machine learning models. However, I show a simple model at the end
so users see how data cleaning and analysis all fit together in a
workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (www.itk.org) has
become a standard in academia and industry for medical image analysis.
In recent years, the ITK developers' community has focused on
providing programming interfaces to ITK from Python and Javascript and
making ITK available via leading applications such as Slicer and
ImageJ. In this course we present best practices for taking advantage
of ITK in your imaging research and commercial products. We
demonstrate how script writing and interactive GUIs can be used to
access the algorithms in ITK and the multitude of ITK extensions that
are freely available on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

memory in the local system. To overcome the native R limitation,
several cluster computing alternatives have recently emerged including
Apache Spark. In this session, we will discuss the architecture of
Spark and introduce the SparkR library. We will work through examples
of the API and discuss additional resources to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we will focus on SparkR. The outline of the tutorial
is as follows: - Introduction to cluster computing with Spark -
Getting started with SparkR - Deep dive into SparkR DataFrame API -
Additional resources&lt;/p&gt;

Jupyter ecosystem for rapidly building just-good-enough solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start by finding and analyzing relevant data in a Jupyter
notebook. We will drag-and-drop our notebook cells into a grid layout,
and publish it as a standalone web app. We will add interactivity to
our notebook and redeploy our app as we iterate.&lt;/p&gt;
