&lt;p&gt;Title:
All causal DAGs are wrong but some are useful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
While the quote “all models are wrong but some are useful” is widely known in statistics, discussions around causal DAGs and causal discovery seem to assume the existence of a “true DAG”. This assumption is problematic as it often results in causal graphs that are less useful. But first we should ask: useful for which purpose? I try to give an incomplete list of more than 5 different tasks for which causal DAGs may help. As not all of these tasks require ground truth from interventions (after all, interventions are often not only impossible, but even ill-defined), I propose that causal discovery should be benchmarked against them. This way, I hope that causal discovery research can gain new momentum after an honest assessment of the current state-of-the-art, using well-defined performance metrics on real data. Further, I hope that these tasks shed some light on the meaning of causality.&lt;/p&gt;
