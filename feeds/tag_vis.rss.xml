Case tree plots depict the emergence and growth of clusters of zoonotic
disease over time. Checkerboard plots also represent temporal case
clusters, but do not construct transmission trees. These plots visualize
outbreak dynamics and allow for analyses like case fatality risk
stratified by generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present two new visualizations, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cmrivers/epipy/blob/master/figs/example_casetree.png"&gt;case tree
plots&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cmrivers/epipy/blob/master/figs/test_checkerboard.png"&gt;checkerboard&lt;/a&gt;
plots, for visualizing emerging zoonoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoonoses represent an estimated 58% of all human infectious diseases,
and 73% of emerging infectious diseases. Recent examples of zoonotic
outbreaks include H1N1, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which
have caused thousands of deaths combined. The current toolkit for
visualizing data from these emerging diseases is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case tree and checkerboard plots were developed to address that gap. The
visualizations are best suited for diseases like SARS for which there
are a limited number of cases, with data available on human to human
transmission. They a) allow for easy estimation of epidemiological
parameters like basic reproduction number b) indicate the frequency of
introductory events, e.g. spillovers in the case of zoonoses c)
represent patterns of case attributes like patient sex both by
generation and over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case tree plots depict the emergence and growth of clusters of disease
over time. Each case is represented by a colored node. Nodes that share
an epidemiological link are connected by an edge. The color of the node
varies based on the node attribute; it could represent patient sex,
health status (e.g. alive, dead), or any other categorical attribute.
Node placement along the x-axis corresponds with the date of illness
onset for the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second visualization, the checkerboard plot, was developed to
complement case tree plots. They can be used in conjunction with case
tree plots, or in situations where representing a hypothetical network
structure is inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plots are available in the open source package epipy, which is
available on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cmrivers/epipy"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. Detailed
documentation and examples are also
&lt;a class="reference external" href="cmrivers.github.io/epipy"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to these
visualizations, epipy includes functions for common epidemiology
calculations like odds ratio and relative risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representing data through colours is a very common approach to conveying
important information to an audience. This is done throughout all fields
in the scientific community and stakes a claim in the commercial and
marketing realm as well. Colour maps and contour maps are the preferred
way for scientists to visualise three-dimensional data in two
dimensions. Research has shown that the choice of colourmap is crucial
since the human brain interpolates hue poorly. We suggest some best
practices scientists should consider when deciding how they should
present their results. Specifically, we look at some examples of
colourmaps that can easily be misinterpreted, making reference to an
in-depth supportive study, and suggest alternative approaches to improve
them. We conclude by listing some open source tools that aid making good
colourmap choices. Kristen Thyng's talk on perception of colourmaps in
matplotlib is an excellent follow-on from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choice of colormap in a scientific figure significantly affects the
way the presented information is perceived by the viewer. This follows
on Damon McDougall's talk on how to choose a colormap for an application
by delving deeper into several important issues and how well many of the
available Matplotlib colormaps stand up against the concerns. For
example, it is known that the human brain is better able to interpret
changes in magnitude of the luminance and saturation of colors in
colormaps instead of the hue. Also, some research has shown that
logarithmic changes in brightness are perceived as linear changes. Next,
being able to print a color plot in black and white from a published
paper is sometimes mandatory and often desirable, and is related to the
grey scale in a colormap. Finally, it is important to account for
various types of color blindness when choosing a divergent colormap for
the plot to be as accessible as possible. All of these concerns have
implications for the design of colormaps, and will be examined in the
context of the properties of the available Matplotlib colormaps in order
to make a best choice for a given application.&lt;/p&gt;

uses the latest web technologies. Its goal is to provide concise
construction of novel graphics, while delivering high-performance
interactivity over large data to thin clients. This talk will cover the
motivation and architecture behind Bokeh, demonstrate interesting uses
and capability, and discuss future plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With support from the DARPA XDATA Initiative, and contributions from
community members, the Bokeh visualization library
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bokeh.pydata.org"&gt;http://bokeh.pydata.org&lt;/a&gt;) has grown into a large, successful open source
project with heavy interest and following on GitHub
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh"&gt;https://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh&lt;/a&gt;). The principal goals of Bokeh are
to provide capability to developers and domain experts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easily create novel and powerful visualizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that extract insight from remote, possibly large data sets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;published to the web for others to explore and interact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe how the architecture of Bokeh enables these
goals, and demonstrate how it can be leveraged by anyone using python
for analysis to visualize and present their work. We will talk about
current development and future plans, including a brief discussion of
Joseph Cottam's exciting academic work on abstract rendering for large
data sets that is going into Bokeh
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JosephCottam/AbstractRendering"&gt;https://github.com/JosephCottam/AbstractRendering&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
