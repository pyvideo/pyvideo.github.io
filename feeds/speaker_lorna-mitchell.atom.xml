This session will cover when to use a serverless approach, and answer your questions about how to get started with it. We'll look at how to write code for these platforms, and how to safely and repeatedly deploy your code to them. We'll also look at how we can use these technologies to build a skill for the Amazon Echo. This session is suitable for Python developers of all levels.&lt;/p&gt;
