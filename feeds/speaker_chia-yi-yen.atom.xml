&lt;p&gt;You never know how to build a successful portfolio that always gives you significant return, but you definitely should know what would make you build a model that is doomed to be a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overfitting is the most common one. In the brief talk, I would like to share some experience how to avoid overfitting. At least in some ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples would be shown in Python toolkit like ipython, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.&lt;/p&gt;
