&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the standard techniques used to build chess playing
programs including minimax, alpha-beta search, piece valuation,
positional valuation, iterative deepening and transposition tables. This
talk will assume a knowledge of python but no knowledge of chess or the
existing literature on how to write chess engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became fascinated by this topic after taking part in a competition
with my brothers to build the best chess program during the Christmas
holidays 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
