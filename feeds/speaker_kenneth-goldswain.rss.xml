Python. The first and more traditional approach uses Flask to build a
web service, while the second approach builds a web service using only
native Python 2.7 libraries without dependencies on any additional
software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk starts by discussing web services in general before moving onto
the different environments our services run in, and what they will be
used for. We will briefly cover the code used, but the focus will be on
the reason why we need two different approaches and we will compare the
risks and benefits of using these two contrasting methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope the talk will inspire people to experiment even further with web
services, or at least give them insight into new ways they could use web
services.&lt;/p&gt;
