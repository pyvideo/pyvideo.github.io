workflow. They can also be a great source of friction. What may begin as
simply running &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;python my_app.py&lt;/tt&gt; eventually bloats as you add more
apps, more databases, more testing frameworks, and more developers.
We'll talk about the evolution of a typical development environment, how
it lets us down, and how we try to make it better. We'll end with an
introduction to Dusty, a new tool which uses Docker containers to take
our development environments to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
