which leverages the interactive capabilities of Jupyter Notebooks to
provide a rich programming environment conducive to the later stages of
software development. I will begin by discussing common workflow in
software development, as well their limitations. I will then motivate
the merits of pynt by demonstrating how adopting a
Jupyter-Notebook-Driven-Development workflow can overcome some of these
limitations, and then how pynt streamlines this workflow. I will end
with a feature-tour of pynt and the different approach to software
development workflow that pynt encourages.Presenter(s): Speaker: Edward
