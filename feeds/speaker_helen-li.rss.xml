analyze genomics data in common bioinformatics file formats such as SAM
and VCF. In addition, Nucleus enables seamless integration with the
TensorFlow machine learning (ML) framework. Nucleus is heavily used in
DeepVariant, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network variant
caller, and in other ML projects at Google AI Genomics. This talk will
give an overview of Nucleus, its features, and its APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
