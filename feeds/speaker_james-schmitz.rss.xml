in Python that is very similar to the widely used Java framework
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://processing.org/"&gt;Processing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to introduce py5 to the Python community and
demonstrate how it can be used for data visualization, art, and
education. It is accessible to beginners while also being capable of
supporting professional artists creating digital art that is shown in
galleries. By design, py5 is integrated into the Python ecosystem,
working well with popular Python libraries such as numpy, matplotlib,
PIL, shapely, and trimesh.&lt;/p&gt;
