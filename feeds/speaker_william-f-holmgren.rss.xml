We will describe our forecast generation system that relies on Dask.distributed for easy parallelism and quick transitions from research to operations. We will also describe three Bokeh applications weâ€™ve developed to explore the output of numerical weather models. Two of these applications can be viewed at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forecasting.energy.arizona.edu/advi"&gt;https://forecasting.energy.arizona.edu/advi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://forecasting.energy.arizona.edu/artsy"&gt;https://forecasting.energy.arizona.edu/artsy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
