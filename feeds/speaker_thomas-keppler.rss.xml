application, mobile apps and a proprietary radio protocol accompanying
it we developed an IoT appliance that connects the existing radio
infrastructure to the Cloud service developed in-house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using CPython 3.5 + Debian GNU/Linux 9 on an ARMv7 platform, we
developed the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this project, we learned a lot about Test Driven
Development of Python apps in teams and DevOps in the IoT space. We
would now like to share our experience developing a Python application
for a headless IoT device and the things we would liked to have known
upfront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is held both by Matthias Schmidt (Senior Architect at diva-e)
and Thomas Keppler (Software Developer at diva-e).&lt;/p&gt;
