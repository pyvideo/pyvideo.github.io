&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will review a methodology to classify train and car journeys using telematics data and go through the challenges often encountered when working on this type of projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As insurers are moving away from traditional demographics factors to price car insurance products, telematics is becoming an increasingly popular solution to assess individual driver risk, optimise motor insurance premiums and encourage safer driving habits. As MyDrive Solutions is using a mobile application as an option to capture data, it is crucial for the company to be able to distinguish between train and car journeys to ensure that policy holders' driving behaviours are assessed fairly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will go through a methodology to classify train and car journeys, reviewing the various tools used to accomplish each task and highlighting the challenges encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
