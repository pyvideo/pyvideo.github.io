&lt;p&gt;[Liffey A on 2022-07-13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;“Code coverage”&lt;/em&gt; value of a codebase depicts how much of the production/development code is covered by the running unit tests. In the world of open-source, all the maintainers try their best to keep this percentage high, and this process is often automated through tools like &lt;cite&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Codecov&lt;/cite&gt;. Hence, code coverage becomes a good metric (not always) to check if a particular codebase is well tested and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source maintainers often prefer to run these unit tests in sub-processes or threads as it allows them to run in parallel and reduce the &lt;cite&gt;CI&lt;/cite&gt; (continuous integration) run time on pull requests. They also make it easier to stop the tests midway if they are taking too much time (probabilistic tests).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will first try to use &lt;cite&gt;coverage.py&lt;/cite&gt; in the default mode on the unit tests running in a sub-process or a thread. After going through the results, we will build a solution to cover the “un-covered” code in the local repository. As a final step, we will also configure a &lt;cite&gt;CI&lt;/cite&gt; (continuous integration) pipeline using &lt;cite&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Codecov&lt;/cite&gt; to automate this process in our remote repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 摘要 Abstract 💡
Unit testing and code coverage are two essential aspects of an open-source codebase. These unit tests often run in spawned sub-processes or threads as sub-processes or multi-threading allow them to run parallelly. However, running unit tests in a sub-process creates a problem; as the documentation of &lt;cite&gt;coverage.py&lt;/cite&gt; says — &lt;em&gt;“Measuring coverage in those sub-processes can be tricky because you have to modify the code spawning the process to invoke coverage.py.”&lt;/em&gt;. As we will see in this tutorial, as soon as we run unit tests inside a sub-process, the coverage module ignores them completely, and the coverage value goes down. Through this talk, we will build up a solution (using &lt;cite&gt;coverage.py&lt;/cite&gt; itself) to tackle this problem! Prerequisites - - familiarity with unit testing and code coverage in Python - familiarity with CI/CD using GitHub Actions - knowledge of multi-threading, multi-processing, CodeCov, and basic data structures like queue would be helpful but is not mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
