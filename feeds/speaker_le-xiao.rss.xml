components and basic business logic. However, neither of these is
executed against the full system environment nor take account of the
system’s behaviors as a whole. Therefore, our app will not be assured to
work properly in production environments if we limit our testing
approach to only two types of tests. Incorporating BDD testing into our
app’s testing plan addresses these limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BDD is experiencing increasing industry adoption but can still prove
daunting to implement from scratch. Our talk will describe how we
implement a BDD framework stack by answering following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we design structured and reusable test code for BDD?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we integrate BDD tests with our CI/CD pipeline?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we speed up the execution of BDD automated tests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we set up our BDD framework?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the limits of BDD testing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
