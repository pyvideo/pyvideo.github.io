products, it is easy for market data infrastructure to become fragmented
and inconsistent. We describe how we have successfully used Python,
Pandas and MongoDB to build a market data system that stores a variety
of Timeseries-based financial data for research and live trading at a
large systematic hedge fund. Our system has a simple, high-performance
schema, a consistent API for all data access, and built-in support for
data versioning and deduplication. We support fast interactive access to
the data by quants, as well as clustered batch processing by running a
dynamic data flow graph on a cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
