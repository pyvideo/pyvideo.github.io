Code and introduce IBM Code and Response, IBM's effort to enable,

disasters through open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural disasters are among the world's greatest challenges, and have
devastating effects both locally, from the many fires that have occurred
in Southern and Northern California (over 17 million acres of land have
been lost to wildfire in the US in the last 2 years), and globally. IBM,
with help a large partnership group including the United Nations and
American Red Cross, developed Call for Code, a global contest
challenging developers to build technologies to aide those going through
adversity. This talk will provide an overview of the past few years of
Call for Code and introduce IBM Code and Response, IBM's effort to
enable, deploy, and create innovative solutions to reduce the impact of
natural disasters through open source. The talk will also highlight some
novel ways developers have used Python in order to accomplish these
goals.&lt;/p&gt;
