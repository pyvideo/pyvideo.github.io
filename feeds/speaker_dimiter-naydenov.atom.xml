of ways. Finding novel, efficient solutions to complex day-to-day
problems with Pandas not only saves time, but can be fun and rewarding
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I’ll present use cases I had to solve, but the
“traditional” approach proved tough and/or otherwise frustrating
implement nicely. Since I was just starting to learn Pandas, decided to
try an alternative solution with it. What I learned changed the way I
think about data processing with Python, and it only got better since!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use cases deals with extracting pen strokes from handwritten SVG
samples, and recomposing them into reusable letters and numbers. When
you need to compare each stroke to all others, often more than once,
resulted in inefficient, slow, and hard to maintain code. Even a naive
Pandas approach with loops helped to reduce both the memory footprint,
and improve the performance considerably! Improving the implementation
further, vectorizing inner loops, and taking advantage of multi-index
operations, I managed to get the same results, using less memory and a
lot faster (by orders of magnitude).&lt;/p&gt;
