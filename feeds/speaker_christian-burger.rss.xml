[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-28 - Brian]
[Online]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Christian Burger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are managing developer teams or departments a pet project may be a helpful tool to stay out of your developers hair and learn about the technologies used in your department without blocking your developers to babysit you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are like me and have a development background, you will want to get your hands dirty and start fixing bugs and implementing stories. However, this can have many negative side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking established rules is easier in a leadership position and sets a bad precedent. By becoming a last instance for each technical decision you take away personal identification with the work of your engineers. It may also lead to distrust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this talk, I want to share some of my experiences in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;
