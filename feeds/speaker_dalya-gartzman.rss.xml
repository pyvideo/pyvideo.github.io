Have you ever wondered what does AlexsCoolFunction do? Did you ever put a funny comment in your code and was upset that noone will read it? Then maybe itâ€™s time to have a better documentation system! Join me for this tutorial, where we will sail through the onboarding stage of Sphinx - an automated documentation package, and learn how we can all collaborate better.&lt;/p&gt;
