The setup work is often grossly underestimated and unseen. I’ll share how Openscapes automates setup with the Kyber R package that uses googlesheets4 and creates RMarkdown documents that become collaborative Google Doc agendas, and sets up repositories and organizes people on GitHub. Kyber replaces manual steps with R functions while maintaining the ability to edit outputs so we’re not constrained by the automation. It has enabled us to teach workshops repeatedly in less time – in 2022, we led four concurrent learning cohorts with 160 government scientists! Kyber is openly available to fork, reuse, and extend, and other groups are doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;
