I'll demonstrate three useful debugging tools and we'll see how we can use them to find bugs, whether they are in networking, logic, or performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop using print statements forever! You'll learn how to use these tools: PUDB - an interactive, ncurses debugger Charles - a web debugging proxy cProfile - python's built-in profiling library RunSnakeRun and SnakeViz - Tool for visualizing profile output I'll also talk about the process of debugging and profiling, common error patterns and how to use your time most efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Beacham (aka Lady Red) is a python developer and Senior Software Engineer at Hipmunk. She also does performance, sewing, sculpture and painting in her free time, and is a frequent sight at the Noisebridge Hackerspace, where this talk was first delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
