capturing type of the &lt;strong&gt;downtimes&lt;/strong&gt; on a production line.Downtime refers
to the time where the machine is stopped for a particular period/time
while it is suppose to run eg breakdown.This project used python, flask
and a mysql database and it was a web application.It was done as a case
study for Unilever Zimbabwe (pvt) ltd.The project was done on two
washing powder production lines. It was all about capturing and storing
time losses and the specific type of the time loss in real time. I did
this as my first python project so it it presents how you can come up
with an idea from a different field and solve it using python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target audience will be mainly industrial engineers and beginners.It
also showcase the use of software in production factories.This can also
help students and learners on how creative they can become while doing a
project either as an individual task or as an educational
requirement.This talk will showcase how you can implement python in an
enviroment where it is not known or used.&lt;/p&gt;
