&lt;p&gt;Presented by Stani Michiels and Nadia Alramli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think Python gives you native cross platform applications for free?
Think twice. Are you interested in distributing your application to
other platforms but not sure how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will give tips and examples on how to enhance the native feel of your
application: notifications, registration of file types and more. The
talk will also help you to avoid common pitfalls and provides solutions
for designing cross platform user interfaces. (Although we use wxPython
as an example, the principles are valid for other toolkits as well.)
We'll show you where to start if you want to distribute your application
to different platforms, briefly discussing tools like py2exe, py2app and
Debian/Ubuntu packaging ecosystem. This talk is based on our experience
from developing Phatch (Photo Batch Processor) and SPE (Python Editor).&lt;/p&gt;
