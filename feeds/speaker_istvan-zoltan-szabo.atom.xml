&lt;p&gt;As a beginner (non-native English) content creator, I had hard times
during my work. Most of the problems came from me because the lack of
confidence and the lack of practice. To grow faster, I had to build a
process (rather a routine) that I can follow during my work on a daily
basis. I had to find the most effective supporting tools. And maybe the
most important: I had to figure out how can I keep myself motivated in
spite of every failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can a junior writer overcome the initial difficulties? My
presentation tries to answer this question through real life examples to
help other juniors in their struggles. And offers some writing tools,
habits, and methods that may be worth to take a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to present what I've learned during my journey so far.&lt;/p&gt;
