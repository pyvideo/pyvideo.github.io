&lt;p&gt;Tl; Dr Generative models are making all the big headlines, understand what, how and most importantly why behind these esoteric algorithms. How can you start building one and why are these models the dark horse of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yann LeCun, the man behind Convolution Neural Networks and the frontier of computer vision research, proclaimed that the future of artificial intelligence lies in unsupervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are Generative models? These are the machine learning models that can learn the hidden representation of a given dataset and then can extrapolate an accurate data point given certain conditions. If all that was jargon for you - here's a better intuitive understanding, imagine if you were given a white canvas to paint a picture of a bird, what would you do? First, you would imagine a bird and then fill in the colors. Well, Generative models do the same thing! Just with a lot of mathematics and sweet python libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaker: Prakhar Srivastava&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings to everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Prakhar Srivastava, researcher, open source lover, and a student. I have worked on Deep learning models for 3 years now and mentor the deeplearning.ai course on Coursera. I've researched with India's leading research college, IIIT Delhi (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/team/prakhar.html"&gt;http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/team/prakhar.html&lt;/a&gt;). I've worked as a student developer in GSoC'18 under OpenAstronomy and as a team leader at Stanford Scholar initiative. I've hosted complete lecture sessions on Deep learning in my college under IEEE. I'm currently working as a Machine learning and research intern at SocialCops, one of India's leading startups.&lt;/p&gt;

implementing convolution neural from scratch without any big frameworks
working in the backend supplementing the need for computation. This
would give the attendees an overall understanding of what are
Convolution Neural Networks and why do they work so exceedingly well in
image processing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session would basically focus on python and it's ecosystem and how
well it goes up with the current research paradigm shift that is
happening due to the boom in Artificial intelligence. The session would
help developers to amass the importance of mathematics and the ease that
python provides in coding it, even from scratch. This would encourage
the developers only to try more and more python programming for deep
learning. For a nascent developer, this session packs in a high
educational reward as he will be exposed to the mathematics behind the
most successful algorithm of the past couple of decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop aims to provide a look through the abstraction offered by
big frameworks for developers to understand why mathematics behind data
science is necessary yet, give them the insight into why abstraction is
a key player in deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What can developers expect from this workshop! Understand what are
convolution neural networks Why they work so well on image data? All the
different implementation of Convolution network and how they improve the
vanilla network What are the best ways to implement convolution network
on a given data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q. What this workshop is not! Just another workshop telling you to use
frameworks Mathematics will not be looked over. (It's important) This
session would provide a much-needed exposure to python programming
language and how its ecosystem helps deep learning so well.&lt;/p&gt;
