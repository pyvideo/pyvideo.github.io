and may challenge and develop your knowledge of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will share my teaching experiences; covering venues, materials, lesson
plans, technical difficulties, engagement, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've considered teaching Python, this talk will give you insight

Learn by writing your first
project! You'll build a complete quiz creation web application. We will
cover topics from data structures and classes, to debugging and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the day of the workshop, you will need to have Python 2.7,
CherryPy, IPython, and Jinja2 installed. Alternatively, you may arrive
at the venue an hour early to receive assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
