&lt;p&gt;I'm going to take you step-by-step through how I built this game. In doing so I'll be answering the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why even? and how did the idea evolve over time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What obstacles did I encounter and how did I solve them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What packages did I leverage?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did I modularize components to make it multipurpose?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will focus less on the details of each function, and more on the way in which they were combined. It is my hope that attendees will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gain a deep understanding of how the game works, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feel confident in their ability to design their own version, using this as a template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
