Think of them as powerful little programs you can run in your Quarto docs. I won't show you how to build a shortcode extension during this talk but rather I'm going to take you on a trip across this new ecosystem of shortcode extensions that people have already written. For example, I'll introduce you to the &lt;cite&gt;fancy-text&lt;/cite&gt; extension for outputting nicely-formatted versions of fancy strings such as LaTeX and BibTeX; you'll learn all about the &lt;cite&gt;fontawesome&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;lordicon&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;academicons&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;material-icons&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;bsicons&lt;/cite&gt; shortcode extensions that let you add all sorts of icons. This is only a sampling of the shortcode extensions I will present, there will be many other inspiring examples as well.&lt;/p&gt;

No, We Want Great Tables</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/positconf-2024/adequate-tables-no-we-want-great-tables.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tables are great, and we’ve been doing a lot on both the R and Python sides to make it possible to generate aesthetically pleasing tables. The gt package for R has been under continuous development for six years, and there are still so many things we can do to make it better. Great Tables, our new Python package, brings beautiful tables to Python users and provides an API that’s in tune with that ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have made great strides and unlocked new table-making possibilities for our users, our ambitions are huge! So, we’d like to show you the state of things on this front and also where we intend to go with our collective table efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

We have many excellent
DataFrame libraries in Python and they give us the flexibility to
manipulate data to our hearts content. But what happens when comes to
presenting tables to others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display of tables can be beautiful. Tables can convey information
effectively, just as plots do and, sometimes, it’s the better way to
present data. Truly, the time has come to bridge the divide between raw
DataFrame output and wondrously-structured tables suitable for
publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's review the state of ‘display tables’ in 2024. We’ll go over which
table components make for effective displays of information. It’s
surprising but there are many considerations that go into making a
well-crafted table. We’ll take a look at the combinations of Python
packages that fit together to make this important task possible, and
marvel together at the tabular results they can provide.&lt;/p&gt;

If this is you (and this was us) it’s both frustrating and prone to errors. And even though every aspect of a typical analysis can be scripted, it often turns out that the table-making part is elusive. We made Great Tables to enable complete publishing workflows. This Python package lets you easily generate publication-quality tables with the structure you want, many options for formatting values, and plenty of freedom for styling. Importantly, Great Tables closely integrates with Pandas and Polars DataFrames in order to handle a wide range of analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
