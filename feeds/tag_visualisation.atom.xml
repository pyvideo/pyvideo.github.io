governing the composition of clauses, phrases, and words in any given
natural language. A grammar of graphics is then the set of structural
rules governing the composition of visual elements. Transforming data
into visual representations using composition is quite powerful and
allows to create complex visualisations with simple building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the ideas behind the grammar of graphics date back well into the
80s, as a Python developer it is only quite recently that we can make
use of it. Altair, backed by the vega specification, is one of the few
plotting libraries in Python that provide such a declarative and
compositional API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will give an introduction to the core concepts behind the
grammar of graphics as well as practical examples how to use altair API
in Python to create vega plots.&lt;/p&gt;

Bonobo ETL, Airflow, and a bit of Grafana (because graphs are cool).
Although the opposite is better, there is no need of prior knowledge
about any of those tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short introduction about the tools, we'll go through the
following topics, using the real data of a small SaaS software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can expect to be able to build a similar system at the end of the
talk in a few days (of course, the implementation is only a small part
of this process, data is what really matters).&lt;/p&gt;

regulations. The latest regulatorily changes enforces the need to work
on the datasets in this controlled environment without created
additional external copies. However Data Scientists prefer to work with
tools they are most familiar like Python, R and Jupyter Notebooks using
to a large amount of open- source packages (numpy, matplotlib, pandas,
..). SAP HANA provides highly optimized in-database machine learning
libraries. In this talk we will present how a Data Scientist can work in
an environment he/she is most familiar with and access the data stored
in SAP HANA using SAP HANA machine learning libraries with a
scikit-learn type interface. Data will remain in the database and will
be exposed as dataframes (similar to Pandas dataframes). We will explain
the software architecture and present a complete end-to-end use case by
using a Jupyter Notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

turns out to be difficult with the standard approach of LDA (Latent
Dirichlet Allocation; Blei et al., 2003). Hotel review texts usually
don't differ as much in the topics that are covered as is typical with
other genres such as Wikipedia or newsgroup articles where there is
commonly only a very small set of topics present in each document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, we developed our own approach to topic modeling that is
especially tailored to non-edited texts like hotel reviews. The approach
can be divided into three major steps. First, using the concept of
second-order cooccurrences we define a contextual similarity score that
enables us to identify words that are similar with respect to certain
topics. This score allows us to build up a topic network where nodes are
words and edges the contextual similarity between the words. With the
help of algorithms from graph theory, like the Infomap algorithm
(Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008), we are able to detect clusters of highly
connected words that can be identified as topics in our review texts. In
a further step, we use these clusters and the respective words to get a
topic similarity score for each word in the network. In other words, we
transform a hard clustering of words into topics into a probability
score of how likely a certain word belongs to a given topic/cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation is structured as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

In 2018,
RStudio introduced its package reticulate and clearly demonstrates that
it favours to join forces. Both languages have strengths and weaknesses.
Tools to combine the strengths will enable easier collaboration in
projects and more possibilities to succeed. Using Python from R gives R
users wider access to functions and makes it easier for Python beginners
to just run scripts and being able to collaborate in Python projects.
The talk will show the possibilities of reticulate: The main part starts
with demonstrating the Python interpreter within R. It will show how to
source Python scripts as well as install and import modules. Then it
will deal with the most important types of Python objects, how they are
represented in R and how to further manipulate them. Thereby, a special
focus is on using Python for data science. In addition, it will be
presented how Conda environments can be created and used from R. A
further application will be the creation of reports with Markdown and
LaTeX where R and Python can be used within one document and share
objects. A last topic is about showing the possibilities for easier
development in RStudio (help regarding Python functions, auto
completion).&lt;/p&gt;
