opened up the possibility to use Computer Vision in various
applications. Particularly in the field of Object detection, Semantic
Segmentation and Instance Segmentation there has been a steady
improvement in algorithms like Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLO, MASK-RCNN. When
to apply what and how to leverage those in real-world applications?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in the era of hyper personalization where relevant information finds you. Recommender systems are an integral part of making this happen. In this presentation we will discuss about various approaches of Recommender systems. We start with basic models like &amp;quot;Content-based filtering&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Collaborative filtering&amp;quot; and move to advanced implementations that use Stochastic Gradient Descent to do &amp;quot;Matrix factorization&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Restricted Boltzmann Machine&amp;quot; using Deep Learning with Tensorflow&lt;/p&gt;
