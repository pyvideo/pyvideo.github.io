End to end automated testing and communicating effectively are important when your project depends on multiple teams spread across functional domains. At Braintree/PayPal, we built a framework to reliably ship developer facing products such as One Touch. In this talk, we will go over using BDD with Behave to describe test scenarios that speaks to both product and engineering, using Appium for mobile automation, and Elasicsearch and Kibana for storage and visualization of test results. You will see how the breadth of packages available on PyPI, the flexibility and ease of Python helped a team of developers whose core competencies were not in Python to collaborate on a common ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only beginner Python knowledge is necessary but an appreciation for the breadth of possibilities with Python is highly encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
