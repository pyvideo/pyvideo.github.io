Charlie Hornsby - Pragmatic Testing
I would like to talk about software testing from a real world point of view, explaining a healthy testing mindset for all programming skill levels. Just as programming skill is a continuum of experience, testing best practices are also not black and white. I will begin with a brief introduction to some testing concepts (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, etc) but the main focus of the presentation will be on ways for both professional developers and hobbyist programmers to improve their use of testing in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author:  I'm a junior developer working in a Django e-commerce company in Helsinki. I've worked with Python for 3 years in both the fields of web development and scientific computing. I moved to Finland from England around 10 months ago and I love talking about Python and progamming in general.&lt;/p&gt;
