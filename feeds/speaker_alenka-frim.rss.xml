In this talk, we share a project we created to combine information from different sources to simplify project maintenance and monitor important metrics for tracking project sustainability, using Quarto dashboards with both R and Python components. We'll share the lessons we learned collaborating on this project - what was easy, where things got tougher, and concrete principles we discovered were key to effective cross-language collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
