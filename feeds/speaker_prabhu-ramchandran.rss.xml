Unfortunately, it remains an ideal and most numerical research papers in the best regarded journals are non-reproducible. I introduce a simple package called automan which allows my research group to fully automate the generation of all results for our research papers. We find that the benefits of this approach are sufficiently motivating that it has become the default way of publishing research in the lab. The added benefit is that this makes our research far easier to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
