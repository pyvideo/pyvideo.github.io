Does it take
more than one command to run your tests? build your docs? publish your
project? deploy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often difficult to share your code because others can run or test
it? Does your README have a series of complicated steps to get things
set up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores three open-source tools that are wonderful at helping
you and your project automate tasks. We'll look at Tox, which
specializes in Python test environments, Nox, which offers a slightly
different approach, and finally, PyInvoke, which you can use to automate
just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;
