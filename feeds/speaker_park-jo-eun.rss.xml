Some companies use larger memory, but most of them are limited to using good equipment due to cost issues.
In a limited environment, purchasing expensive equipment can allow for more data and processing, but the reality may not be easy. I would like to use Python to solve various methods that can be used when dealing with large data in a limited environment without spending money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park Jo-eun
I run a YouTube channel called 'Today's Code'. I am also a Microsoft MVP, and I am interested in data and enjoy dealing with data with Python. I have mainly worked as a backend developer at games and advertising companies, and recently I have been giving lectures, creating content, and working on projects at companies, educational institutions, and schools in various domains.&lt;/p&gt;
