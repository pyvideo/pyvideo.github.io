important to lower barrier to entry for DL adoption for the developer
community. This can be done by 1) retaining and reusing existing and
popular libraries as much as possible and employing them in development
of DL applications, and 2) Automating model development as much as
possible though usage open source AutoML tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Numpy enhances Numpy by adding GPU support and parallel processing
to it, while aspiring to remain 100% numpy compatible. It enables
easy-to-use and easy-to-extend AutoML with a focus on deep learning, and
making AutoML deploy in real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we focus on the use of Deep Numpy and AutoGluon for rapid
development of DL models.&lt;/p&gt;
