Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are known to be a major factor influencing many physical traits, diseases and other phenotypes. Using publicly available data and tools we predict phenotype from genotype using SNP data (approximately 1 million SNPs). We utilize data analysis and machine learning approaches only, no domain knowledge, so that our automated approach may be generally used to predict different phenotypes from genotype. In the first application of our method we predicted eye color with 87% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

approaches to detection of gene interactions. Our method is based upon
training a supervised learning algorithm to detect disease, and then
quantifying the effect on prediction accuracy when alleles of two or
more genes are perturbed to unmutated in patterns so as to reveal and
characterize gene interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is well known that two or more genes can interact so as to enhance or
suppress incidence of disease, such that the observed phenotype differs
from when the genes act independently. The effect of a gene allele at
one locus can mask or modify the effect of alleles at one or more other
loci. Discovery and characterization of such gene interactions is
pursued as a valuable aid in early diagnosis and treatment of disease.
Also it is hoped that the characterization of such interactions will
shed light on biological and biochemical pathways that are involved in a
specific disease, leading to new therapeutic treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much attention has been focused on the application of machine learning
approaches to detection of gene interactions. Our method is based upon
training a supervised learning algorithm to detect disease, and then
quantifying the effect on prediction accuracy when alleles of two or
more genes are perturbed to unmutated in patterns so as to reveal and
characterize gene interactions. We utilize this approach with both a
neural network and a support vector machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We test the versatility of our approach using seven disease models, some
of which model gene interactions and some of which model biological
independence. In every disease model we correctly detect the presence or
absence of 2-way and 3-way gene interactions using our method with both
neural network and support vector machine. We also correctly
characterize all of the interactions as to the epistatic effect of gene
alleles in both 2-way and 3-way gene interactions. We conclude that
machine learning approaches can be used to successfully detect and also
characterize gene interactions in disease.&lt;/p&gt;
