&lt;p&gt;Presented by Graham Dumpleton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will cover the challenges of creating a production
application performance monitoring system for Python. It includes an
overview of the architecture of the system, as well as how it hooks into
Django and captures details about web transactions, database
transactions, memcache requests, exceptions and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google App Engine is a unique hosting platform that lets you build
applications and run them in Google's data centers using the massive
global infrastructure built to run the Internet's most powerful company.
App Engine offers a development environment that uses familiar
technologies (Java and Python) and provides a powerful and robust set of
APIs to users while maintaining security and independence from other
apps running in the cloud. It is always free to get started so you can
try it out with no risk, and if you need additional computing resources,
you can purchase additional computing resources beyond the free quota
limits. (If you enable billing and trust us with your credit card, we
will extend your free quotas even further; you won't get charged until
you exceed those &lt;em&gt;extended&lt;/em&gt; quotas.) Scale your application to millions
of users and pay only for what you use at competitive market pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we provide an update of the newest features found in
the most recent releases of the App Engine platform. We also share some
suggestions for best practices to existing App Engine developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginners to the App Engine platform will be interested in the
introductory workshop which may be offered (see description below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google App Engine workshop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we'll give you a comprehensive introduction to the
platform in two/three components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-hour Introduction to Cloud computing and Google App Engine seminar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-hour App Engine hands-on workshop/codelab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first hour, we review Cloud Computing as an industry and where
Google App Engine fits into the picture. Specifically, we discuss App
Engine as a PaaS solution because of the inherent challenges of building
web and other applications. We'll outline the architecture of App
Engine, what it's major components are, introduce its features and APIs,
discuss the service and how it works (including information on the free
quotas), present some information about current users and usage,
including integration with Google Apps, and finally, give an overview of
its enterprise edition called Google App Engine for Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the approximately one-hour lecture, we'll show you how to create
applications that run on App Engine by building a simple but real web
application from the ground up via a hands-on coding laboratory.
Although based on the online tutorial, this codelab goes up and beyond
what's in the documentation: you will get a more detailed step-by-step
instructions to replicate that example as well as have the opportunity
to extend your application with some of the newer APIs that come with
App Engine. The codelab will cover the Users service, non-relational
Datastore, and Memcache APIs. Time-permitting, we'll also discuss some
of the newest features found in recent App Engine releases.&lt;/p&gt;

approach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented by Jinal Jhaveri&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOLapps is one of the top providers of social games and user generated
applications with 50+ million monthly uniques on Facebook, MySpace and
Bebo. This session will focus on the top-down approach we took to scale
our webapps for millions of users. Here are the 6 topics we will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is performance a big issue for Social Media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we profiled our apps and found bottlenecks using custom developed
and existing middleware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The web application best practices we applied and results obtained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we traced database connection leaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our caching strategies and the changes we made to speed up the
memcache client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results of our experiment using Paster and Tornado as our web
servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
