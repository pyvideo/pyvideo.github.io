Rooted in the development of the open source package CyFi, this talk includes insights around identifying when your model is getting the right answer for the wrong reasons, the upsides of using decision tree models with satellite imagery, and how to help non-technical users build confidence in machine learning models. The intended audience is those interested in using satellite imagery to monitor and respond to the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
