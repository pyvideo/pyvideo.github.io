Specifically, PyMC-Marketing is a new library built on top of the popular Bayesian modeling library PyMC. PyMC-Marketing allows robust estimation of customer acquisition costs (via media mix modeling) as well as customer lifetime value.
In addition, I will show how we can estimate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns using a new Bayesian causal inference package called CausalPy. The talk will be applied with a real-world case-study and many code examples. Special emphasis will be placed on the interplay between these tools and how they can be combined together to make optimal marketing budget decisions in complex scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

I present a Bayesian histogram anomaly detector (BHAD), where the number of bins is treated as an additional unknown model parameter with an assigned prior distribution. BHAD scales linearly with the sample size and enables a straightforward explanation of individual scores, which makes it very suitable for industrial applications when model interpretability is crucial. I study the predictive performance of the proposed BHAD algorithm with various SoA anomaly detection approaches using simulated data and also using popular benchmark datasets for outlier detection. The reported results indicate that BHAD has very competitive predictive accuracy
compared to other more complex and computationally more expensive algorithms, while being explainable and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayesian Networks are increasingly being applied for real-world data problems. They provide the much desired complexity in representing the uncertainty of the predicted results of a model. The networks are easy to follow and better understand the inter-relationships of the different attributes of the dataset. As part of this talk, we will look into the existing R and Python packages that enable BN learning and prediction. The pros and cons of the available packages will be discussed as well as new capabilities that will broaden the application of BN networks.&lt;/p&gt;

methods to build more complex models using PyMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of this course is to introduce new users to the Bayesian
approach of statistical modeling and analysis, so that they can use
Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc"&gt;PyMC&lt;/a&gt; effectively to analyze
their own data. It is designed to get users quickly up and running with
Bayesian methods, incorporating just enough statistical background to
allow users to understand, in general terms, what they are implementing.
The tutorial will be example-driven, with illustrative case studies
using real data. Selected methods will include approximation methods,
importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods such as
Metropolis-Hastings and Slice sampling. In addition to model fitting,
the tutorial will address important techniques for model checking, model
comparison, and steps for preparing data and processing model output.
Tutorial content will be derived from the instructor's book &lt;em&gt;Bayesian
Statistical Computing using Python&lt;/em&gt;, to be published by Springer in late
2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Installation Instructions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to install the Python packages required for this
tutorial is via
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/"&gt;Anaconda&lt;/a&gt;, a scientific
Python distribution offered by Continuum analytics. Several other
tutorials will be recommending a similar setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of Anaconda is a command line utility called
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;conda&lt;/tt&gt; that can be used to manage third party packages. We have built
a PyMC package for &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;conda&lt;/tt&gt; that can be installed from your terminal
via the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/pymc pymc
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should install any prerequisite packages that are required to run
PyMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat is that conda does not yet have a build of PyMC for &lt;strong&gt;Python
3&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, you would have to build it yourself via pip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
pip install git+git://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc.git&amp;#64;2.3
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you on Mac OS X that are already using the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://brew.sh"&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; package manager, I have prepared a script
that will install the entire Python scientific stack, including PyMC
2.3. You can download the script
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/fonnesbeck/7de008b05e670d919b71"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and
run it via:&lt;/p&gt;
