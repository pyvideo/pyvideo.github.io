learning tasks. But what happens when the data you need isn't available
in some convenient and easily obtainable form? This talk will go through
the process of data scraping to create a dataset that can be then used
for various analytical or machine learning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to have a very large and high-quality dataset in order
to perform significant analytics or to use in various machine learning
tasks. For some tasks, there exists simple APIs or repositories of data
to collect from. But for many other tasks like tracking prices of
products, predicting stock prices, and predicting outcomes of sports
games there isn't a convenient way to retrieve this information besides
a webpage. Because of these circumstances, learning to scrape data from
webpages and other sources allows us to create our own dataset.
Additionally, scraping grants us the ability to ask better questions
about data in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is geared towards beginner-to-intermediate Python developers
that want to be able to ask and answer better questions through data.
This talk will provide a guide for web scraping through two examples,
and it will explain how to get the scraped data into a usable form.
Throughout the talk, I will highlight some tips for improving scraper
performance, minimizing the risk that a web server will stop you, and
different ways to store the collected data. The first of the two
examples will examine a simple case of scraping data about the lottery
and the second will explore a more challenging case of scraping course
information from a University.&lt;/p&gt;
