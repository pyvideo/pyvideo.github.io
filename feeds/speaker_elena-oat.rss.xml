Elena Oat - Building a marketplace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivation for this talk is sharing my own experience with implementing Stripe payments in a Django application. I will, specifically, touch on Stripe Connect which is meant for marketplaces. Django is still missing a package for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will include challenges faced and some of the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author:  I've been a speaker in 2014 and 2013 at PyCon Finland. I am the founder of Helsinki PyLadies&lt;/p&gt;
