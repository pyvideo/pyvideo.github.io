In this talk, we discuss the practical aspects of complex data-driven dashboards. There are tutorials and guides available which help teach new users the basics, but this talk focuses on the challenges of building more complex, industry-ready, deployed dashboards. There are a variety of niche issues which arise when you push the limits of complexity, and we will share the solutions we have developed. We will demonstrate these solutions as we walk through the entire lifecycle from data ingestion, though exploratory analysis to deployment as a finished website.&lt;/p&gt;
