read my carefully written documentation. While people will read, not
everyone learns by reading the docs. Since my goal is to make sure my
documentation can meet as many learning styles as possible, that has
meant spreading my documentarian wings and bridging out from only
writing the docs into recording them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my documentation journey has been learning how to create
screencasts and I want to share that knowledge with everyone. From
picking the right topics, to outlining, to writing a script (yes I
promise, there is still writing involved), to how to record your audio
and video, I'll cover it all. You don't need to be a professional voice
actor or videographer to create a screencast, even a writer can create
something wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
