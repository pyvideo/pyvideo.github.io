&lt;p&gt;I was annoyed and frustrated with the cost of setting up a video stream
of nature at school. It can be a couple of hundred pounds to set up a
live bird box. A wonderful resource but can be prohibitively expensive
for schools, so I had a go at doing it myself. I decided to set up some
camera traps using a few Raspberry Pi computers and I was really amazed
at how easy it was and how brilliant the results where. It turns out I
have badgers at the bottom of my garden! I now have several set up
including an auto tweeting camera on a bird feeder (&amp;#64;pibirdbrain) and a
few at school including a pond cam where we've managed to get some
really great and close up pics of tadpoles and newts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to show others how easy it is to get going (you don't need to be
an expert), that it's really cheap and fantastic fun.&lt;/p&gt;
