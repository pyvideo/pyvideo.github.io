But what if, as you get older, you want to keep at the keyboard? Thoughts from a (now) veteran developer on building your career in software development for the long-haul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a community talk. My favourite topics from DjangoConEU 2017 were the non-technical talks. The most interesting (on-topic) conversations I had were about the non-programming aspects of working in software. I wanted to give a talk on that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prima facie&lt;/em&gt; I'm not the best place person to talk about diversity (white, male, etc), but, having been freelance since 2006, with four young children, and now slightly greying hair, I am in a position to talk about how to build a career in software development for the long-haul. Hiring in tech is massively ageist. I want to discuss strategies to handle that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My target audience is individual programmers (whether freelance or employed) as well as software managers, looking to build &lt;strong&gt;and retain&lt;/strong&gt; a team. (The message for managers is simply that they need to facilitate their employees' careers. This seems obvious but it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; worth bringing out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core point of my talk is around the idea that a career is very much a marathon rather than a sprint, and that it needs to be approached in that spirit. (Again, this may seem obvious but it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; worth bringing out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two aspects of this. The one is &lt;strong&gt;pace&lt;/strong&gt;. That to work on software day-in, day-out for 10, 20, 30, 40 years (or more) we need to pace ourselves, to manage our reserves, and to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other is that there is noting to be scared of. That expertise which now may seem intimidating is, yes, available to us too. That with 5, 10, 15 years of continued effort we too (yes, us) can be as experienced as whomever, in the speciality we choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this out with three points. That we need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be disciplined&lt;/strong&gt;: The key point is to keep going. We each need to find patterns that work for us and develop them into habits that we build into a routine. The great thing is it doesn't have to be 100 hour weeks. As long as we keep doing it, whatever we do builds up over time. Despite the impression to the contrary, time is on our side. Which leads to...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be prolific&lt;/strong&gt;: Do lots, and put it out there. This one seems scary. &amp;quot;I'll never do as much as ...&amp;quot; —&amp;nbsp;but it's an illusion. Do one thing. Put that out there. Do something else. Repeat. Again, the work builds up over time, and (seemingly) all of a sudden, you're in a position of being the expert. Finally...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be social&lt;/strong&gt;: And I don't necessarily mean Facebook (unless Facebook is your thing). In whatever environment or medium suits you get out there meet people. (Stretch your comfort zones a bit here.) Share what you've done. Relish in what others have done. Be part of the community. Help build the community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three of these are essential. As you get older — all the more as you get older — they allow you to build a sustainable career writing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tale is brought out with stories on finding work, and on choosing clients, and employers, financial planning and job security, on family and free-time, and on the importance self-care. It's part inspiration, part battle-plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Choose, and choose quickly: Optimising ModelChoiceField&amp;quot; by Carlton Gibson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever had a ModelForm, a DRF Serializer, a FilterSet grind to a halt rendering a choice field? Of course you have. Ever given up on it and resorted to raw ids? -- No don't answer that. We're going to look at how you can get a grip on ModelChoiceField when you're dealing with lots of related objects, and when you need to offer that choice again and again and again, without needing to put the kettle on.&lt;/p&gt;

team are technical, you often don't want the limitations and complexity of full
CMS. No, you want to use familiar tools: you want to write in Markdown and
manage your content in git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't necessarily fit the traditional Django workflow. You end up
looking at a static site. This is fine but you loose the ability of Django to
serve dynamic pages. You have to decide which of the numerous generators
you're going to use, or whether indeed you'll roll your own. It's a bit of a
mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have the best of all worlds though. Sphinx, yes the
documentation builder, is a super capable static site builder. You can
use it to build your content. Yes it can handle Markdown. Then you can
use Django to serve that content, given auth, forms, interactivity,
custom content, and all the rest of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to show you how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk has two parts: Sphinx and then Django.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First we'll introduce using Sphinx to manage and build your content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll look at project setup so you can use Markdown for files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll organise those on the file system, and use git to manage them, rather
than a full-blown CMS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll push to GitHub and use a GitHub Action to build on each commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we'll setup Django to serve our Sphinx built content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll use the DTL to get control over our templates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we'll add auth, to provide dynamic per-user content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the sky's the limit. Content management never looked so rosy.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk is about how we enable more contributors from across the community, how they (You!) can get involved, and how you can make sure that it helps your career.
Django looks like it’s doing just fine: it’s a popular framework in a popular language. We have major releases every six months. We have Django Girls, a Foundation (and Fellows), super conferences in glamorous locations, and more.
But the code is old and there’s only the smallest number of people that regularly contribute. We need more. We need you!
What’s more, as good as we are elsewhere as a community, the group of contributors isn’t as diverse as the community at large: there are clearly barriers to entry here. We’re trying to change that, and we want to invite you to come and join-in.
Contributing to open source is great fun, it’s a great learning opportunity, and it can really help your career.
I’m going to tell you how to get involved, and how to get support in that.
Importantly I’m going to tell you how to avoid the pitfalls.
You are qualified to contribute. More than that, your contribution is the future of Django. Come code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the code is old, there are 1300+ accepted open issues. There’s only

&lt;p&gt;It’s fine now. But it won’t be. Your web framework needs you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing to open source is great, and it’s great for you.
Historically we’ve not been that good at encouraging new and diverse
contributors. We’re trying to change that, and we want to invite you to
come and join-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Django, being batteries included and all, is meant to big, clumsy, slow. I'm going to show you how use it as a micro-framework.
I'll show you how the base HTTP layer works, and what those middleware things are all about. I'll show you how to customize that so that Django can keep up with anything.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will provide a brief introduction to async, cover its pros/cons, and show how to build async into your Django app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at four different ways to build a real-time chat app and see how the need for async comes up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-polling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server-sent events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Websockets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting async online can be the hardest bit, so we’ll wrap up with a few pointers on deployment to get you on your way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moderated by Dawn Wages, our panelists will discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how we can continue to grow the Django community and create a welcoming space for beginners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the priorities for the continued development and maturation of Django&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ways to improve Django events and bring them to new regions worldwide, especially in the COVID landscapee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;success stories from Django communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concrete steps toward better and more effective diversity and inclusion efforts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how Django fits into the larger Python ecosystem, especially as other fields like data science continue to grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and much more. It’s been a long time since we gathered leaders of the Django community on one stage to have an open-ended discussion about Django’s present and future, and we hope you’ll join us for this special event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Panelists&lt;/p&gt;

Particularly with HTMX, but also related technologies like Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS, we've rapidly gone from a world where seemingly the only option was &amp;quot;API First&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of bootstrapping a new application in these latter days. On a core of almost old-school Django combined with HTMX, with a just sprinkling of Alpine.js, we've been able to build a rich and interactive web application, with hardly a JSON response or payload in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll show the integration patterns we've learnt, and what the limits of those might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll look at what the future might bring. As we grow the application we're looking whether we will need edge computing, offline, and richer behaviour purely on the client. Is that the limit of the hypermedia driven approach? Is that where we need an API? It's not clear: it's still very much &amp;quot;API Maybe&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

We'll explore how mentoring, community involvement, and support networks are important in keeping Django resilient. By highlighting the work of groups like Django Girls, PyLadies, Djangonaut Space, and Black Python Devs, we’ll see how these initiatives not only foster personal growth but also play a vital role in keeping the Django community strong and sustainable for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Panelists' unique journeys in the Django community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The role of mentorship, sponsorship, and advocacy in these communities and in Django's future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successes and challenges in building supportive, sustainable communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the Django community can keep investing in long-term success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our panelists include:
- &lt;strong&gt;Lacey Henschel&lt;/strong&gt;, moderator, former Django Girls contributor and organizer
- &lt;strong&gt;Keanya Phelps&lt;/strong&gt;, Django Girls organizer and participant, mentor in Djangonaut Space
- &lt;strong&gt;Afi Maame Dufie&lt;/strong&gt;, involved in Django Girls, PyLadies, and Black Python Devs
- &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Boyce&lt;/strong&gt;, Django Fellow, co-founder and mentor in Djangonaut Space
- &lt;strong&gt;Carlton Gibson&lt;/strong&gt;, former Django Fellow, mentor in Djangonaut Space, mentor and coordinator of Django's efforts in Google Summer of Code, and Django Girls coach and advisory board member.
