For example how can one best overcome the classic trade-off between quality and cost of production, when the monetary value of quality is not defined? In this gentle introduction to multi-objective optimisation you will learn about Pareto Fronts and how they can be used to optimise for multiple objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a data driven decision maker you will learn the advantages and shortcomings of the technique and be able to assess applicability for your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;
