Using Python with Ham Radio</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pyohio-2023/hamming-it-up-using-python-with-ham-radio.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amateur (Ham) Radio is a hobby and service that has been around for
generations. A lot of the concepts have not changed over the years, but
the technologies that enable Hams to talk around the world have evolved
and developed greatly over the years. Ham Radio is all about
experimenting and learning new things with electronics and software. But
what if there is not something that you can find that quite fits what
you want to be able to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will look at some of the ways that Python can be used
to fill in some of the gaps and what Python can do to help you in Ham
Radio.&lt;/p&gt;
