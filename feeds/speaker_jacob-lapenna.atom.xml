It is a story of system design and product development. It is a tale of
great breadth, covering distributed computing, custom printed circuits,
electromagnetism, some of the largest hydropower generators in the
world, and the software and hardware that brings this all together. This
tale covers several years of research and development, culminating in a
cyber physical system built on open-source software and easily
attainable off-the-shelf products and components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Reclamation is the 2nd largest hydropower generator in the
United States and operates 53 hydroelectric plants with 14.7 gigawatts
of installed capacity. On average, Reclamation plants generate 40
billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually. It takes a large fleet
of rotating machines (generators and pumps) across the western United
States to produce this much electricity, and operations and maintenance
of this fleet is a significant part of Reclamation’s annual budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During routine diagnostic and maintenance tasks, it is often necessary
to slowly and precisely turn a machine’s rotor to make measurements at
various rotational positions. This was previously done with many
personnel climbing into the machine and pushing (or, for very large
machines, complicated crane maneuvers). This is dangerous, inefficient,
and lacks precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With custom software and intelligent system design, we have developed a
modular system that can easily scale to turn even our largest machines
with the click of a button. The software can track the machine’s
rotational position in real time to one thousandth of a degree and can
easily expand to accommodate future diagnostic test methods. What once
put personnel at risk and potentially took days to carry out can now be
done in hours with little to no risk to personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
