provide a best assessment of what will happen in the future.
Understanding the future can guide current decisions. This talk will
provide a quick guide on using deep learning approaches in building
predictive models in python. It will give a brief introduction to
predictive models, deep learning, Tensorflow and Thenao.&lt;/p&gt;
