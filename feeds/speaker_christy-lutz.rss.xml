makes your output stronger and more diverse. But it can be hard when
your work is being evaluated. Sometimes, it feels like your reviewers
have a deep and abiding interest in pain. You’ll never succeed! Well,
you have already succeeded just by asking for feedback. Together, we’ll
discuss how to build up your tolerance for taking that feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback became so much easier for me when I learned design critique
guidelines from a co-worker and UX Designer. Design critique guidelines
are a set of rules and practices that can make getting and giving
feedback easier. After presenting this speech at the Write the Docs
Portland 2017 conference, I received a ton of great feedback on it. Now,
I have even more strategies to share so that you can implement design
critique guidelines into your own review process to make feedback
painless.&lt;/p&gt;

In order to be an effective technical writer, you must carry an entire cast of characters in your head. So many, in fact, that you might feel like you need help from a great and powerful wizard just to keep up. You already have a Brain, full of technical knowledge and communication skills. You already have a Heart, open to forging alliances with your co-workers, teammates, and SMEs. If you only had the Nerve, so that you could carve out just the right place for you and your documentation and become the king of the how-to jungle.
From a new(er) writer to new (and experienced) writers, this presentation offers strategies for fostering courage in technical documentation. I will share the methods that fortified me while working on my first tech docs, some game plans for staying bold that I used as I gained more experience, and the secret I discovered about cultivating courage no matter where you are in your tech writing career.&lt;/p&gt;
