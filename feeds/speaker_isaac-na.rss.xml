This is achieved through a Python-powered Infrastructure-as-code architecture. CDP provides an entire backend and frontend that can be easily deployed for a governing body of any size or location. As long as the deployer provides data for events in a pre-defined yet flexible structure, CDP provides a database, file storage, speech-to-text transcription, and natural language search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this session, we will cover CDPâ€™s backend, primarily focusing on how we created ETL pipelines and an Infrastructure-as-code setup to be as low cost and easily forkable as possible. Because of this, backend-focused developers may get the most out of this talk. Additionally, this session is intended for people of all levels of Python experience. Instead of covering in-depth features or niches of the language itself, we will showcase some neat tools and open-source projects in the Python ecosystem that we use to build our infrastructure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this session is especially for anyone interested in civic tech or generally just making democracy more transparent!&lt;/p&gt;
