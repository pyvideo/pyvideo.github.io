Strategies for solving performance problems - presented by Caleb Hattingh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Liffey A on 2022-07-15]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a performance problem, and you don't know what to do. All you know is that one of your endpoints or applications is too slow; and perhaps it only affects a certain user or customer. How do you figure out why it's slow, and what can you do to catch performance problems before they hurt users in production?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll go through a wide range of strategies for detecting and diagnosing performance problems in typical production workloads. We'll cover both web-based domains as well as backend domains and other analytical applications involving number-crunching and big-data applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll step through the following high-level strategies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracing: through instrumentation of your code, you will get detailed traces of where the time is spent in generating your web server responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profiling: we'll look at profiling strategies using both the Python built-in cProfile tool, as well as awesome 3rd party libraries like pyspy, including how to use these with pytest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolation: how to figure out if performance is affected by CPU, or memory, disk, or network IO limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reasoning: we'll look at common scenarios that result in performance regressions such as the needless execution of sub-queries in rendering web views, or algorithmic analysis and &amp;quot;&amp;quot;big-O&amp;quot;&amp;quot; notation, or concurrency problems resulting from exhaustion of threads in a pool and asyncio concurrency limitations resulting from overloaded subscription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prophylaxis: we'll look at how to include benchmarks within your CI pipeline, including with pytest and other technologies to catch performance regressions ahead of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

the GIL which prevents multi-core concurrency. Cython provides tools for
addressing both issues, and in a way that is simple enough for the
average programmer to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to get started with Cython&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools to make day-to-day Cython work easier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to dramatically speed up a slow function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to distribute work over multiple CPU cores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Python, to a (nominally) 6-18 age group at a local Brisbane CoderDojo
for 2015 Term 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scratch and Alice have become very popular for teaching beginner coding
at CoderDojo events. Languages such as Python, and even HTML/CSS, are
more difficult to introduce, partly because more skills are required
before something &amp;quot;useful&amp;quot; can be created, and partly because the
&amp;quot;building blocks&amp;quot; are usually not presented with the same visual
immediacy as Scratch, and similar environments. This talk presents some
of the difficulties found in transitioning from graphical environments
to Python, and observations in using existing tools for learning Python
with younger students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/77/view_talk"&gt;https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/77/view_talk&lt;/a&gt;
Well, do you?  If so, there are a bunch of tips and tricks that you can learn that will get you up to speed very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating lesson content is always demanding and time-consuming.  Using screencasts as a medium of instruction is no different, but there are clearly very specific habits that can make you much more efficient.  Specific advice about working with Python and the Jupyter Notebook will also be covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, this talk will also touch on aspects related to working with a publisher. These will include drafting the initial scope of work, negotiating timelines, and managing feedback and criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

Devices need to report position data to servers, and Python handles this role well, especially with the new support for asynchronous event loops in Python 3 which can handle tens of thousands of simultaneous connections. In addition, the struct module in the Python standard library makes short work of processing binary data supplied by devices. In addition to basic interaction with tracking devices, this talk will also present methods of integration (server) testing using py.test, as well as considerations regarding support for both UDP and TCP protocols in the same stack, since different GPS tracking devices may prefer one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will show how to make a multiplayer computer game using Python Arcade, both over a local network, and also on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
