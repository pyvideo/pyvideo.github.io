But what are the most efficient practices to work with Jupyter notebooks to get the most out of this technology? In this talk Dmitry Trofimov, team lead of PyCharm IDE, will show how different tools help you solve your daily tasks using Jupyter notebooks: JupyterLab, Hydrogen plugin for Atom, VS Code, and PyCharm (all tools are open-sourced). We will discuss their pros and cons and look at them in action.&lt;/p&gt;

In this session, He will talk about how you can build a scalable analytics workflow system based on Airflow (Python) and write extensible job using Python. GCP has provided fully managed Airflow service called Cloud Composer. So he will explain how you can easily build Airflow cluster compared to building your own Airflow cluster on the on-premise server or AWS EC2.&lt;/p&gt;

If there is one thing that you want to learn this year to make yourself a better developer, it will be empathy. In this talk, we will see, as a developer how to practice empathy and write code empathetically. Also, we will discuss how empathy driven development will make one a better software craftsman and build great teams.&lt;/p&gt;

Application performance monitoring (APM) makes tracking down issues problems much easier. But which tools should you use?  With the release of Elastic APM, there’s a new option. Language server and Python client is fully open source so you can get started with any app.  Elastic’s APM was released some time ago, so it’s a very fresh option for tracing performance problems in Python applications (and other runtimes as well). The basic platform is free so it should be a welcome change for Go developers used to spending huge bills on comparable hosted platforms.  It’s useful out of the box for tracing basics on web requests including: - Request details - Response time percentiles - Transaction timelines - Application errors and stack traces - Individual code lines - Distributed Tracing  It can also be used to track any custom span in any Go application to find out where time is being lost and users are being slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;

Previously restricted to math geniuses with access to supercomputers and massive data centres, machine learning tools are increasingly available as web services which are easily consumed from more traditional web applications. Python has become the lingua franca of machine learning, so Python developers are well placed to take advantage of the next wave of application development. This talk outlines the various machine learning platforms and provides a set of practical examples that demonstrate how Python developers can start taking advantage of artificial intelligence in their own applications.  The intended audience is pretty wide: web developers, students, data scientists should all come away with a set of ideas and tools for implementing machine learning without needing a degree in artificial intelligence!&lt;/p&gt;

Explaining Black Box Model Predictions in Python</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-philippines-2019/how-did-you-know-explaining-black-box-model-predictions-in-python.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As algorithms get more and more complex (i.e. Ensemble models - XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks), it becomes harder to explain the predictions they make. These 'Black Box' models may produce more accurate results but may in fact hard to operationalize in the real world as it gets harder and harder to explain to business decision makers how a model came up with the prediction. In certain cases such as in credit scoring model interpretability is crucial particularly for regulatory compliance. This talk will highlight certain Python tools and libraries such as LIME, ELI5 and Skater, that would allow data scientists to finally be able to explain how their models came up with its predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

For Tagalog and other Filipino languages, however, this is rarely the case. I developed a novel technique that essentially transfers the knowledge of the labeled training dataset on one language (English) into Tagalog and other Filipino languages. This thus enables one to develop Neural Network Sentiment Classification models on several Filipino languages, leveraging on the availability of large amounts of training data on the English language. This is a better approach than manually labeling data on Filipino languages, as it would take too many resources, and Neural Networks need huge amounts of training data in order to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

Since it is not scalable to write tests for all possible interactions, we turn to property-based testing - an approach where we generate tests instead of writing them.  Property-based testing (PBT) is a random-testing approach that first became popular in the Haskell community as QuickCheck. It works by generating random examples to find minimal counterexamples to a pattern or law that ought to always hold true. PBT is especially useful in testing edge cases and interactions between multiple features, particularly in stateful systems. This talk introduces the principles of PBT along with its history and success stories. We then illustrate PBT patterns and examples in Python using Hypothesis. Finally, we see how it fits in with TDD and integration testing.&lt;/p&gt;

We hear a lot of buzz with the new fancy asynchronous Python programming using async/await keyword to make our Python code run faster. But really how async works are still not spread well and the majority of Python programmer still not familiar using async/await keyword. In this talks, because Flask is not intended to support async (yet), we are will explore Quart, the Python ASGI web microframework. It is intended to provide the easiest way to use asyncio functionality in a web context, especially with existing Flask apps. This is possible as the Quart API is a superset of the Flask API. So you can instantly migrate your Flask app easily!&lt;/p&gt;
