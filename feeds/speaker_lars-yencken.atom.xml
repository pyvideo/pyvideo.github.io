&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk we present Triage, a homegrown tool at 99designs for
aggregating and managing errors in a live production system. Although
written in Python, Triage is designed to ingest errors in a language
agnostic way. We describe our path from simpler logging techniques which
we outgrew, the new workflows around error management which it allows,
and some challenges we faced along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

But the data for it all is scattered in the wind, stuck in excel files of massive organisations, in tiny addendums to research papers, and even in government tweets. Roll up your sleeves, we'll dive into efforts at Our World in Data to collect, organise and republish this data for great good!&lt;/p&gt;
