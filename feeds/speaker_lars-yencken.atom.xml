As they
grow in traffic, infrastructure, services and features, keeping track of
errors and communicating about them becomes more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk we present Triage, a homegrown tool at 99designs for
aggregating and managing errors in a live production system. Although
written in Python, Triage is designed to ingest errors in a language
agnostic way. We describe our path from simpler logging techniques which
we outgrew, the new workflows around error management which it allows,
and some challenges we faced along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
