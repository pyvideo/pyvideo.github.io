&lt;p&gt;LANGUAGE DETECTION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to address URL based translation and Django language detection easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTL LANGUAGE DIRECTION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them are speaking in a language which is written right to left so it’s not enough to just translate your app to their language. You should change the style of your app to display them in a correct format. Some graphic elements should be flipped horizontally to make sense for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHARACTER ENCODING ISSUES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are working with a language with completely different form of alphabet and characters there is a huge chance that you face an issue if you don’t abide some encoding standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CALENDAR SYSTEM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those countries have their own calendar which is completely different from gregorian calendar which is used in most of west countries. There are some apps helping you to convert unix timestamp to those different calendar format in both backend and frontend side&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INTERFACE DESIGN AND PROPER FONTS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As their language is RTL some graphic elements need to be mirrored. Although it is true for most of layout parts but there are still some sections that needs to keep their direction, like mathematical equations, multimedia players progress bar, … Using modern frontend tools like SASS mixin to automatically float elements depending on the language direction.&lt;/p&gt;
