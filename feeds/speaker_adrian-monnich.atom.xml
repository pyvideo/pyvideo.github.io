&lt;p&gt;But the JavaScript ecosystem has evolved a lot - one can now use tools
like Babel to write modern JS even when targeting older browsers and a
Webpack+Babel build is very straightforward and allows for advanced
preprocessing of JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll even go one step further and not only use Webpack to
build the assets, but also integrate a small demo Flask app with a React
frontend where the Flask app only serves the static HTML page and uses a
RESTful API to communicate with the React app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also look into how to keep convenient Flask features such as URL
building in client-side code (using the js-flask-urls package) and of
course React hooks will be used!&lt;/p&gt;

And depending on what you use, you may even have to change because the provider you are using is changing their APIs. Flask-Multipass provides an easy-to-use wrapper around this complexity. This talk will go into details on why the extension was created, which cases it covers (and which it doesn't - it's not another Flask-Login!), and how its flexibility allows easy implementation of new authentication methods.&lt;/p&gt;
