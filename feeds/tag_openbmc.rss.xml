The core of the software that performs these functions is implemented in Python, allowing easy to read, modify and debug firmware that is traditionally not accessible to a user. This talk will cover the architecture of the OpenBMC and demonstrate how easy it is to support a new server platform by writing a few lines of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
