Six years ago, with a shiny new CCNA in my hand, I started my IT career as a network administrator. I taught myself some Python, and then things escalated quickly. Now I'm a devops engineer in the field of network automation. Python, Docker, and Linux are my usual tools, with a bit of Golang sprinkled in. I live in San Antonio with my wife and three cats. In my non-work hours, I enjoy baking bread, gardening, and playing Dungeons and Dragons. My pronouns are she/they.&lt;/p&gt;
