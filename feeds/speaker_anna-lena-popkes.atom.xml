[Online]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Anna-Lena Popkes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk was inspired by a personal project I worked on a while ago where I created my own magical universe in order to learn and apply Python concepts I hadn’t used before. Some of these concepts are included in the talk in a clear, precise and well-explained manner, including examples from the magical universe. The talk tells a story about how our passions can be used for learning to create something magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level: The talk is suited both for beginners and intermediates. It might even contain some new knowledge for professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Required knowledge: Only basic Python knowledge is required, all other concepts will be introduced and explained clearly in the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the talk is two-fold:
a) the audience should understand that learning becomes much more fun and engaging when they look for a topic they are interested in and use it for learning.
b) the presented Python features should become clear such that everyone is able to use them in future projects or come back to the talk if they need a well-explained reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When and how to start coding with kids by Anna-Lena Popkes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/when-and-how-to-start-coding-with-kids"&gt;https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/when-and-how-to-start-coding-with-kids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our world is driven by technology and there are many reasons to teach our kids how to code. For example, coding allows them to develop logical reasoning skills and teaches attention to detail. Allowing children to discover how much fun coding can be supports them in their development and opens many doors for their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when and how should we start coding with kids? This talk will approach the question from a scientific perspective, looking into how children's brains develop, how children learn and how to best teach them coding abilities. It will answer important questions like &amp;quot;At what age can a child start coding?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;What are the benefits of learning to code?&amp;quot;. It will also present possible starting points, like learning platforms or tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
