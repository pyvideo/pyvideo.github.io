&lt;p&gt;Description
Challenges with Audio Classification problems focussing on cleaning and building features from audio which can then be used to build a classification model, features that work well with audio and speech data and the open source libraries useful for the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Audio data, unlike other data, needs a bit of a different approach while trying to extract information and building classification models. I will talk about cleaning audio signal approaches, how to form features from an audio and what features help extract the unseen information that can help with classification models.&lt;/p&gt;
