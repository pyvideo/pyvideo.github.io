It can support retrievals of winds using information from weather radar networks constrained by high resolution forecast models over grids that cover thousands of kilometers at kilometer-scale resolution. Unlike past wind retrieval packages, this package can be installed using anaconda for easy installation and, with a focus on ease of use can retrieve winds from gridded radar and model data with just a few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
