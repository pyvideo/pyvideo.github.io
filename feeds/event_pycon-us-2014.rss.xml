Yes! You can
do it for Android, iOS and other platforms with using Python. In this
talk I speak about tools you may use for developing applications with
using OpenGL ES for different platforms, the ways and concepts which are
used in those tools, some tips and tricks you may use to make a
cross-platform game with Python for fun and profit.&lt;/p&gt;

surprising number of layers &amp;amp; components. For a newcomer to the language
or the platform, this can be overwhelming at the start. Here I'll take
you on a drive through Django's request-response cycle, focusing on
using its layered model to understand what's going on and get things
done.&lt;/p&gt;

showing off the style of development that SQLAlchemy is most geared
towards, the so-called &amp;quot;&amp;quot;foundational&amp;quot;&amp;quot; style which provides for
development and maintainance of custom conventions which then service
the needs of the model declarations and use case implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

the steps you'll need to take to start the ball rolling towards Skynet
using a $20 helicopter and an Arduino.&lt;/p&gt;

cloud computing platforms are I/O and memory limited, and hence are poor
matches for data-intensive computing. After 4 years of research software
development we are now instrumenting and benchmarking our analysis
pipelines; numbers, lessons learned, and future plans will be discussed.
Everything is open source.&lt;/p&gt;

Software guarantees
are commonly incomplete with good reason: promises that are narrow and
few are most easily kept across wide ranges of platforms and long times.
We define the space of a module's allowed behavior to be its &amp;quot;behavioral
envelope&amp;quot; and show that thinking and speaking in terms of envelopes
eases maintenance and makes APIs delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

made, ideas we discarded, and the unique treatment we have to give each
of our four official database backends.&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, API
designers (and that includes you, if you've ever coined a function) have
a great duty, as language inventors, to expand the mental canvases of
those who come after. We'll concretize that into 7 hallmarks of good
APIs, pulling examples (and bloopers) from popular Python libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

(Flask-FeatureFlags) to look at the different ways you can make Flask
awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

IPython Notebook and pandas. I'll show you how to read in data, clean it
up, graph it, and draw some conclusions, using some open data about the
number of cyclists on Montréal's bike paths as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

every component and feature. But not so many take a look at the bits
that let Django be Django. In this talk, we'll see exactly what those
bits -- some old, some new -- are, in a way that shows why it's still a
solid and popular choice for web developers nearly nine years after its
initial public release.&lt;/p&gt;

performance software on it. It's hard to make Python fast, and yet there
are incredibly high performance Python VMs. This talk breaks down the
facts and the myths of Python performance.&lt;/p&gt;

science? In psychology experiments developed by myself and Peter
Battaglia, participants are immersed in an interactive 3D world which is
experimentally well-controlled, yet also extremely fun. This talk will
explain how we created these &amp;quot;game-like&amp;quot; experiments in Python using the
Panda3D video game engine.&lt;/p&gt;

and PyPy. See how CPython deals reference counting's shortcomings with a
special GC for cycle collection. Then dive into PyPy's sophisticated and
high-performing GC implementations. The particularly thorny issue of
finalizers in reference cycles will also be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

but view the whole process as a bureaucratic paperwork nightmare to
check off on your ready-to-ship checklist. This is the wrong way to
approach testing. Tests are a solution to a problem that is important to
you: does my code work? I'll show how Python tests are written, and why.&lt;/p&gt;

all works? Open source legend Andrew Tridgell runs an annual week-long
post-graduate primer course teaching &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Free and Open Source Software
Development &amp;quot;&amp;quot;. This talk will convey as much of this course as possible

practice. Setting a break point and inspecting local variables is easy,
but what else can you do? What if you need to set the breakpoint in one
of your dependencies, or only fire it conditionally? How do you navigate
calls, or change them? Join me for an in depth look at how you can
better use PDB to debug and understand programs.&lt;/p&gt;

Linux containers. Docker's feature set includes versioning, sharing etc.
They are light-weight and fast, you can recreate a deployment
environment in development or push your development containers to
production. Imagine never having to worry about fragmentation of servers
or syncing the versions of different libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

library. It is focused on someone new to SQLAlchemy Core, who has
experience with other database technologies such as Django or SQLAlchemy
ORM. We'll cover the differences between the domain-centric models of
those tools compared to the schema-centric model and how we can use that
to deal with common and unusual data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

struggle with, talk about their impact, discuss personal experiences
dealing with them, and share some tools useful in fighting back.&lt;/p&gt;

Internationalizing your
codebase with gettext (bit.ly/pyconi18n) might just be the simpler part
of the puzzle. It's hard to maintain translations in a fast paced
deployment environment without constant manual intervention. This talk
covers tools and strategies you can adopt to automate your localization
process and ensure high translation coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

time and focus on the &amp;quot;critical 3%&amp;quot;. How can we identify that 3%? How
can we best focus our optimization efforts, and avoid the &amp;quot;root of all
evil&amp;quot; that is premature optimization? This talk introduces key types of
performance testing, and demonstrates how they can be paired with
profiling techniques in a cycle of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

You expect to be able to
put data into your database, have it to stay there, and get it out when
you query it... hopefully in a performant manner. When its not
performant enough the two options are usually add some indexes or throw
some hardware at it. We'll walk through a bit of a clearer guide of how
you can understand and manage DB performance.&lt;/p&gt;

Brython
is an experimental Javascript library that enables you to leverage the
elegance of Python on the client side. Novice programmers who are
familiar with Javascript will learn about Brython, how Brython measures
up against Javascript, and why getting client-side Python adopted as a
mainstream tool is really difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

You'll see
how to keep your system clean as an end user excited about installing a
Python module from the web, the purpose of setup.py, how virtualenv
makes life easier (and sometimes harder), what Ubuntu/Debian tools can
offer, and how to make a complex app easier for new contributors to run.
It is heavy on stories and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

someone's written some code in another language that solves your
problem. What options do you have for interacting with this external
code from within your program? We'll examine how to call external
binaries, what happens behind the scenes at a systems level, and how
these implementation details affect performance and memory usage. In the
second part of the talk, we'll discuss the different options for more
tightly integrating external code in the form of a C library for better

for other people to do. It's easier to swallow when you see how unit
testing improves not only the correctness of your code, but the design
as well. I'll walk through a real-life case study where adding unit

remember the community with a fondness that likely doesn't accurately
reflect the former reality. We'll explore how we can take a set of
articles from an online community and winnow out the stuff we feel is
unworthy. We'll explore some of the machine learning tools that are just
a &amp;quot;pip install&amp;quot; away, such as scikit-learn and nltk.&lt;/p&gt;

intentions. It is considered a micro-framework, but don't get the
&amp;quot;micro&amp;quot; part fool you; Flask can do everything others can do, many times
in a simpler, leaner way. In this tutorial session you will follow me as
I write a complete web application in front of your eyes using the core
framework and a handful of extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

But your friends can't see it - what's wrong? I'm
betting DNS. Maybe you've fixed a couple of entries, point some records
to hostnames, waited patiently for new domains to resolve only to notice
your nameservers are incorrect. But what actually goes on with DNS? Come
to this talk to find out how DNS works, and how to interact and create a
DNS with Python.&lt;/p&gt;

problems involving iteration and data flow. However, one of their more
powerful uses is in customizing various aspects of program control flow.
In this tutorial, we'll look at some more exotic uses of generators such
as writing context managers, inlining callback functions, eliminating
recursion, implementing actors, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

it easy to debug and extend for Python developers. This talk will
introduce Salt as well as explore some of the things that make it
unique.&lt;/p&gt;

We'll look at the problem - code sharing and reuse across modules - and
different ways we could solve it. We'll come up with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; from
parallel universes and then reinvent python's actual implementation.
Finally, we'll import - using python's design - without using the
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
