This subset can then be used to train machine learning models with high efficiency and resulting accuracy. In this talk we will introduce apricot, a Python package for submodular selection, and show examples of its usage.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will be an overview of the most important features behind pomegranate and motivate the concept of probabilistic modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

A computational method for predicting pairwise contacts without the need to run a Hi-C experiment would be invaluable in understanding the role that 3D chromatin architecture plays in genome biology. In this talk I will describe Rambutan, a Python package that uses a deep convolutional neural network to predict Hi-C contacts at 1 kb resolution using nucleotide sequence and DNaseI assay signal as inputs. I will explain the area of chromatin architecture briefly, how Rambutan fits in with other methods in the field, validate this model using both traditional accuracy metrics and at biological tasks, and show how one can use Rambutan simply in their own work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pomegranate is a python module for probabilistic modelling focusing on both ease of use and speed, beating out competitors, including scikit-learn, in benchmarks. In this talk I will describe how to use pomegranate to simply create sophisticated hidden Markov models, Bayesian Networks, General Mixture Models (and more!) and benchmark their implementations to other python packages.&lt;/p&gt;
