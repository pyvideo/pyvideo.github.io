LinkedIn make friend recommendations? Or how epidemiologists track down
patient zero in an outbreak? If so, then this tutorial is for you. In
this tutorial we will use a variety of datasets to help you understand
the fundamentals of network thinking, with a particular focus on
constructing, summarizing, and visualizing complex networks.&lt;/p&gt;

Politics,
mathematics, law, finance, pretty much any data can be modelled as a
network and in this tutorial we introduce the basic of network theory
using the pydata ecosystem(NetworkX, Pandas, matplotlib) and we will use
a Game of Thrones character network and the US Airport dataset to look
at some real world network data.&lt;/p&gt;

problems - as in, data problems that involve relationships between
entities. Participants should already have a grasp of for loops and
basic Python data structures (lists, tuples and dictionaries). By the
end of the tutorial, participants will have learned how to use the
NetworkX package in the Jupyter environment, and will become comfortable
in visualizing large networks using Circos plots. Other plots will be
introduced as well. It will also form the grounding knowledge for Part
II of the tutorial. Prerequisite skills: Pandas, matplotlibPresenter(s):

Diffusion of news through Twitter? JFK, ORD or ATL, do these codes look familiar? In this tutorial we build up on the fundamentals of Part 1 tutorial and look at various applications of network analysis to real world datasets like the US Airport Dataset, Game of Thrones character co-occurrence network, and foray into diffusion processes on networks.&lt;/p&gt;

Or how epidemiologists track down patient zero in an outbreak? If so, then this tutorial is for you. In this tutorial, which is Part I of a two-part series, we will use a variety of datasets to help you understand the fundamentals of network thinking, with a particular focus on constructing, summarizing, and visualizing complex networks. With this tutorial, you will be well equipped to explore advanced topics (dynamics on graphs, evolving graphs, and network propagation methods) in Part II.&lt;/p&gt;

This will be
a hands on tutorial and will require writing a lot of code snippets. The
participants should be comfortable with basic python (loops,
dictionaries, lists) and some(minimal) experience with working inside a
jupyter notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly the tutorial is divided into four parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part A (20 mins)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of graph theory and various examples of networks in real life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to the NetworkX API and various data structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part B (30 mins)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with small synthetic networks (generated using random graph
generators) to understand the structure of the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyse the network and study various properties of the network like
centrality, connectivity, shortest paths, cliques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part C (30 mins)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll use the various techniques we have learnt so far and model a
network out of real world data like co-authorship network(
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/cond-mat-2005.zip"&gt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/cond-mat-2005.zip&lt;/a&gt;) and
study the structure and properties of this network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part D (10 mins)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll work on some interesting problems like temporal networks and
visualisation of networks. - We'll model the US Airport Network with
respect to time and will try to make sense out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the tutorial everyone should be comfortable with hacking
on the NetworkX API, modelling data as networks and basic analysis on
networks using python.&lt;/p&gt;
