This will be
a hands on tutorial and will require writing a lot of code snippets. The
participants should be comfortable with basic python (loops,
dictionaries, lists) and some(minimal) experience with working inside a
jupyter notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly the tutorial is divided into four parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part A (20 mins)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of graph theory and various examples of networks in real life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to the NetworkX API and various data structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part B (30 mins)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with small synthetic networks (generated using random graph
generators) to understand the structure of the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyse the network and study various properties of the network like
centrality, connectivity, shortest paths, cliques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part C (30 mins)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll use the various techniques we have learnt so far and model a
network out of real world data like co-authorship network(
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/cond-mat-2005.zip"&gt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/cond-mat-2005.zip&lt;/a&gt;) and
study the structure and properties of this network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part D (10 mins)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll work on some interesting problems like temporal networks and
visualisation of networks. - We'll model the US Airport Network with
respect to time and will try to make sense out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the tutorial everyone should be comfortable with hacking
on the NetworkX API, modelling data as networks and basic analysis on
networks using python.&lt;/p&gt;

Starting with a computationally-oriented definition of a graph and its associated methods, we will build out into progressively more advanced concepts (path and structure finding). We will also discuss new advances to speed up NetworkX Code with dispatching to alternate computation backends like GraphBLAS. This will be a hands-on tutorial, so stretch your muscles and get ready to go through the exercises!&lt;/p&gt;

insights from them? Come discover how NetworkX makes this easy (and
fast!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is broadly divided into two parts. First we will talk about
the power of graph analytics and how you can use tools like NetworkX to
extract information from your data, and then we will talk about how we
made the machinery behind NetworkX work with heterogeneous backends like
GraphBLAS (CPU optimized) and cuGraph (GPU optimized).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="part-i"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part I&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NetworkX is the most popular library in Python for graph theory and
applied network science thanks to its extensive API and
beginner-friendly documentation. NetworkX is used &amp;quot;everywhere&amp;quot;, because
graphs are everywhere. Don't believe me? We surveyed more than 300
Python packages to understand how they use NetworkX in domains ranging
from geoscience, neuroscience, genomics, biology, chemistry, quantum
computing, text and language, machine learning, causal inference,
optimization, and more. We will summarize what we learned to help you
apply graph analytics to your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you start using NetworkX you will soon realize that the pure-Python
implementation starts becoming a roadblock to scalable graph analytics.
This takes us to the second part of the talk...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="part-ii"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Part II&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should you do when your graph data becomes too large or NetworkX
becomes too slow? Simple: use an accelerated NetworkX backend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NetworkX 3.0 added the ability to dispatch to other implementations.
This means you can use other highly tuned libraries from NetworkX to
achieve up to 100 to 10_000+ times speedup! As &amp;quot;the API for graphs&amp;quot;,
NetworkX now makes it easy to accelerate your graph workflows on CPUs
with GraphBLAS and NVIDIA GPUs with nx-cugraph. Other backends are
welcome, and we plan to support distributed graphs soon for extreme
scalability 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

problems - as in, data problems that involve relationships between
entities. Participants should already have a grasp of for loops and
basic Python data structures (lists, tuples and dictionaries). By the
end of the tutorial, participants will have learned how to use the
NetworkX package in the Jupyter environment, and will become comfortable
in visualizing large networks using Circos plots. Other plots will be
introduced as well. It will also form the grounding knowledge for Part
II of the tutorial. Prerequisite skills: Pandas, matplotlibPresenter(s):
