&lt;p&gt;Serverless is often thought of in terms of FaaS (like AWS Lambda). There are though many other Serverless services, for instance in AWS there is DynamoDB, API Gateway, Cognito and so on. Serverless microservices can be composed of these underlying services to achieve huge flexibility and speed. However, there is the trap of building a distributed monolith if the right tooling and approach are not used. At the end of 2019 AWS launched a new Serverless service, Amazon EventBridge, making it easier to connect microservices and ingest third-party SaaS as well as AWS events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will go through the steps to build a state-of-the-art Python Serverless Microservice architecture based on Amazon Eventbridge through the &amp;quot;EventBridge Storming&amp;quot; approach (an extension of Event Storming from Domain-Driven Design). From idea to code in 8 steps.&lt;/p&gt;

Serverless offers scalability and speed with a nice abstraction layer to many web and mobile applications, as well as massive concurrency which can be run large workloads in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss what is possible with Serverless for parallel algorithms and services to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will cover:
- What Serverless is (AWS Lambda and beyond)
- The Serverless Services on AWS and other cloud providers
- How to write code for Serverless
- How parallelism works on Serverless
- How to orchestrate parallel workloads with Serverless Services like AWS Step Functions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
