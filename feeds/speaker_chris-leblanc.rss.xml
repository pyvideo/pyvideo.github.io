Ewing from the university of Canterbury. It bridges the worlds of Python
and C, letting you write code that runs close to C speed in a syntax
that is very close to Python. This talk will show how you can speed up a
typical Python program with Cython datatypes. We’ll call C functions
directly, passing NumPy arrays with ease. We’ll see how we can release
the global interpreter lock, letting us run multiple threads in parallel
near C speeds. We’ll look at Cython’s parallel module for data
parallelism and compare it to some alternatives and discuss the pros and
cons.&lt;/p&gt;
