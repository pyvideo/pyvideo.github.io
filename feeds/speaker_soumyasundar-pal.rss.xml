&lt;p&gt;Graphs are ubiquitous in modelling relational
structures. Recent endeavours in machine learning
for graph structured data have led to many
architectures and learning algorithms. However,
the graph used by these algorithms is often
constructed based on inaccurate modelling
assumptions and/or noisy data. As a result, it
fails to represent the true relationships between
nodes. A Bayesian framework which targets
posterior inference of the graph by considering
it as a random quantity can be beneficial. In
this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric
graph model for constructing the posterior distribution
of graph adjacency matrices. The proposed
model is flexible in the sense that it can
effectively take into account the output of graph
based learning algorithms that target specific
tasks. In addition, model inference scales well
to large graphs. We demonstrate the advantages
of this model in three different problem settings:
node classification, link prediction and
recommendation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
