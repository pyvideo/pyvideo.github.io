categorical and text data. CatBoost is the first Gradient Boosting
library to have text features support out-of-the box. This talk will
walk you through main features of CatBoost library and explain how it
deals with text data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradient boosting is a powerful machine-learning technique that achieves
state-of-the-art results in a variety of practical tasks. For a number
of years, it has remained the primary method for learning problems with
heterogeneous features, noisy data, and complex dependencies: web
search, recommendation systems, weather forecasting, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some problems contain different types of data, including numerical,
categorical and text data. In this case the best solution is either
building new numerical features instead of text and categories and pass
it to gradient boosting, or using out-of-the box solutions for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CatBoost (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://catboost.ai/"&gt;https://catboost.ai/&lt;/a&gt;) is the first Gradient Boosting library
to have text features support out-of-the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CatBoost is a popular open-source gradient boosting library with a whole
set of advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CatBoost is able to incorporate categorical features and text
features in your data with no additional preprocessing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CatBoost has the fastest GPU and multi GPU training implementations
of all the openly available gradient boosting libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CatBoost predictions are 20-60 times faster then in other open-source
gradient boosting libraries, which makes it possible to use CatBoost
for latency-critical tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CatBoost has a variety of tools to analyze your model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will walk you through main features of this library including
the way it works with texts.&lt;/p&gt;

CatBoost (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://catboost.yandex"&gt;http://catboost.yandex&lt;/a&gt;) is a new open-source gradient boosting
library, that outperforms existing publicly available implementations of
gradient boosting in terms of quality. It has a set of addional
advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CatBoost is able to incorporate categorical features in your data
(like music genre, URL, search query, etc.) in predictive models with
no additional preprocessing. For more details on our approach please
refer to our NIPS 2017 ML Systems Workshop paper
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://learningsys.org/nips17/assets/papers/paper_11.pdf"&gt;http://learningsys.org/nips17/assets/papers/paper_11.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CatBoost inference is 20-60 times faster then in other open-source
gradient boosting libraries, which makes it possible to use CatBoost
for latency-critical tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CatBoost has the fastest GPU and multi GPU training implementations
of all the openly available gradient boosting libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CatBoost requires no hyperparameter tunning in order to get a model
with good quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CatBoost is highly scalable and can be efficiently trained using
hundreds of machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover a broad description of gradient boosting and its
areas of usage and the differences between CatBoost and other gradient
boosting libraries. We will also briefly explain the details of the
proprietary algorithm that leads to a boost in quality.&lt;/p&gt;
