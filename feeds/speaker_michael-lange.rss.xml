In this talk we introduce Devito, an open-source domain-specific framework for solving partial differential equations from symbolic problem definitions by the finite difference method. We highlight the generation and automated execution of highly optimized stencil code from only a few lines of high-level symbolic Python for a set of operators used in seismic inversion problems, before exploring the use of Devito for a range of scientific equations.&lt;/p&gt;
