structure. Originally a domain of academic institutions, however,
nowadays it is getting used more and more, particularly thanks to its
usefulness in distributed systems. Examples of functional properties in
code include: usage of immutable variables, recursion, pattern matching
or higher-order functions, which are not always easy to understand for a
beginner. In this talk, we will introduce some of the functional
programming properties and their usage in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
