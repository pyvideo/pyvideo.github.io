It uses asyncio and thus required that I created/adapted a number of libraries to use asyncio throughout. AutoBuddy grew organically through hit and misses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been a software engineer for over 30 years. I used the Internet before the World Wide Web existed. I still love the stuff. Now, Home Automation is my hobby even though my wife and kids keeps complaining about it. I wrote AutoBuddy, so I think I am the best person to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
