It takes on many forms from instructing an entire team to a new process or an informal knowledge transfer between two engineers. Many shy away from the opportunity, but can find that often the mentor can learn as much as the mentee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me as we explore the importance of teaching in tech, where we will start with Bloom's Taxonomy as the driver for learning. From there, I'll provide examples and case-studies from my own experiences in tech and how I learn from those specific use-cases to generalize for future applications.&lt;/p&gt;
