Lessons learnt from the human side of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When JPMorgan decided to give Python development tools to hundreds of non-developers, it was a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the huge amounts of financial data available and the tools becoming easier to use, it made sense to allow the business to extract relevant information directly themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly the infrastructure had to be there: a Python development &amp;amp; runtime environment, access to data and to JPMorgan analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But having the infrastructure ready was only the beginning.  We needed training.  It needed to be relevant, rewarding, and even fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about the culture?  How do we get non-developers to take their first plunge into Python, and then get into good development habits, without becoming full-time developers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of our on-going journey.  We learnt some important lessons along the way.  Weâ€™ll share them so that you too can give Python to non-developers.&lt;/p&gt;
