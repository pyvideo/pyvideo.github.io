first success story related to the collection of vibration data in wind
turbines and the analysis of vibrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wendelin (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wendelin.io/"&gt;http://wendelin.io/&lt;/a&gt;) combines automated cluster deployment,
distributed data persistency for NumPy arrays, parallel data processing,
fluentd compliant data ingestion interface and JIO compliant javascript
interface. It is an all­in­one open source solution that provides a 100%
native python alternative to hybrid solutions based on Spark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is derived from the presentation made at MariaDB community
event (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mariadb.org/en/community-events/"&gt;https://mariadb.org/en/community-events/&lt;/a&gt;). The presentation of
Wendelin Full Stack will be shorter than in Santa Clara in order to
provide enough time to present the first implementation for Wind
Turbines. We will show in particular which parts of data analysis are
handled on server side with pydata libraries, which parts of data
analysis are handled on browser side in javascript and how both can be
integrated to minimize implementation costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk concludes on Wendelin platform roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
