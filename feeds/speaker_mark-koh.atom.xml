However, when python code bases start to become large and have many contributors, they can start to become unmaintainable and error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MyPy is a static type-checking library that you can add to your python projects to check the Type Hints proposed in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/"&gt;PEP 484&lt;/a&gt;.  Static typing allows you to explicitly specify what types of objects your functions expect -- it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- code-block: python

from typing import Iterator

def fib(n: int) -&gt; Iterator[int]:
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a &lt; n:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MyPy is a project blessed (and being worked on) by Guido himself, and is the key to making Python robust enough for enterprise production code bases.  This talk will cover the following topics:
- The benefits of static type checking in Python
- A crash course on adding Type Hints and MyPy to your code base
- A demo for adding MyPy type checking to your CI/CD pipeline
- Learnings from adding static type checking to systems at Spotify&amp;amp;trade;&lt;/p&gt;
