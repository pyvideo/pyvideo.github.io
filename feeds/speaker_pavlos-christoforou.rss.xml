&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point Nine provides operations outsourcing and support to large and
complex financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our day to day responsibilities we are required to process
our client's trading activity which generally involves receiving data in
various formats and through various protocols, apply transformations,
validations and enrichment processes and distribute the resulting data
to various third parties, in short Data Plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to introduce the audience to the (vast) field
of financial data processing which we believe presents a tremendous
opportunity for python and it's community and provide a brief overview
of Point Nine's deployment of Python as the main framework for all data
plumbing activities.&lt;/p&gt;
