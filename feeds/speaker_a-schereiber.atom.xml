&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many scientists are using a laboratory notebook when conducting
experiments. The scientist documents each step, either taken in the
experiment or afterwards when processing data. Due to computerized
research systems, acquired data increases in volume and becomes more
elaborate. This increases the need to migrate from originally
paper-based to electronic notebooks with data storage, computational
features and reliable electronic documentation. This talks describes a
laboratory notebook based on the Python data management software
DataFinder. It allows to manage data from experiments and simulations,
to run analysis software and to create visualizations of results. The
laboratory notebook assures that the complete history of all performed
steps (&amp;quot;Provenance&amp;quot;) is recorded, that results can be signed digitally,
and that results can be archived in a secure archive to avoid and
prevent legal issues.&lt;/p&gt;
