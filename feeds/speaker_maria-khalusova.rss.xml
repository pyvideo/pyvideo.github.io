is crucial, as it decides which model youâ€™ll ultimately use. How do you
choose an appropriate metric? This talk will explore the important
evaluation metrics used in regression and classification tasks, their
pros and cons, and how to make a smart decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll go through evaluation metrics for regression tasks
(R squared, MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RMSLE) and classification tasks
(Classification accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC/AUC,
Precision/Recall AUC, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and ways to
extend some of these from binary to multiclass problems). I'll talk
about the differences between them, the trade- offs, and when some may
be more helpful than others.&lt;/p&gt;
