I want to talk about the challenges migrating a system with over 2 million sign ups with no downtime. The systems are radically different making it challenging at time. We're 60% done.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll be talking about what we learned from our initial implementation and sharding style as well as the details we used in implementing a newer system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, learn about why we shard, why you probably want to shard, what we originally tried and why it didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, learn about how we re-implemented sharding including the router, unique id generation and all the code that went into the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I'll touch on some of the more advanced topics such as shard re-balancing and dealing with replication lag time.&lt;/p&gt;
