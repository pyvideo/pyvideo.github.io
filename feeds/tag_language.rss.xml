Gone are the days where simply knowing one technology really really well is sufficient to stay on the cutting edge. We are expected to write web-based applications, mobile applications, cross-platform applications and so on. Even as we know we should learn more and branch out, that choice is increasingly difficult as the technology options explode.
This talk will give you one very solid choice that is familiar to .NET developers: Python. It may seem like a very different language and ecosystem when compared to .NET but just below the surface, there are many more similarities than there are differences. For .NET's Entity Framework, Python has SQLAlchemy. For .NET's ASP.NET MVC, Python has The Pyramid Web Framework. The list goes on and on.
Come learn why your team should learn Python as a complementary language to .NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dr. Graeme Cross&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess
and put in a speed hack until you have proven that's where the
bottleneck is.&amp;quot; (Rob Pike)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is a great balance of productivity, expressiveness and
performance, but there are times when it would nice to have a Python
application run faster. This is particularly true for large scale data
processing, numerical work, controlling real world devices, and
animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using some real-world examples, this talk covers tools and techniques
that allow you to systematically understand where the bottlenecks are in
your code and then how to effectively optimise your code, without having
to resort to writing modules in C/C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Richard Jones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present a whirlwind update of the state of Python as of
June 2010. It will cover the evolution of the language itself, its
variants, versions and veracity. It will cover the state of packaging,
distributing and pypi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Tennessee J Leeuwenburg (Australian Government Bureau of
Meteorology)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is used within the Bureau of Meteorology to automatically
generate weather forecast text based on numerical data. In addition, the
development team has also used Python to introspect the forecast
language and statistics used in the past. NTLK is an open-source
language processing toolkit which can be used for visualising language
patterns. This presentation will talk about some of the techniques used
for automatically describing datasets and also how NTLK can be used to
discover information about language uses and requirements in an
organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

Systems and Applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented by Ivan Beschastnikh, Justin Samuel, and Justin Cappos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seattle is an open-source platform for developing and deploying
networked applications. Core feature of Seattle is that it allows safe
execution of untrusted code on end-user systems. In our talk we look at
how we used Python to build a safe, restricted code execution
environment for Seattle that not only provides execution safety but also
enforces strict resource consumption limits. In addition, Seattle
includes a high-level API to hide inconsistent OS-specific behaviors
from developers. What results is a platform that welcomes the
participation of end-user machines for general-purpose distributed
programming and creates new possibilities for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
