&lt;p&gt;[Wicklow Hall 1 on 2022-07-14]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the effort put in at every Python version to increase the runtime performance, we know that throughput efficiency is one of the top priority items in the Python ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the extensibility and ease of use of the Python Web ecosystem and the increased focus on performance, Robyn was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn is one of the fastest, if not the fastest Python web framework in the current Python web ecosystem. With a runtime written in Rust, Robyn tries to achieve near-native rust performance while still having the ease of writing Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will demonstrate the reasons why Robyn was created, the technical decisions behind Robyn, the increased performance by using the rust runtime, how to use Robyn to develop web apps, and most importantly, how the community is helping Robyn grow!
Finally, I will be sharing the future plans of Robyn and would love to get feedback from the developers to see what they would like to see in it.&lt;/p&gt;

know that throughput efficiency is one of the top priority items in the
Python ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the extensibility and ease of use of the Python Web
ecosystem and the increase of performance by using Rust as a core, Robyn
was created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn is one of the fastest Python web frameworks in the current Python
web ecosystem. With a runtime written in Rust, Robyn achieves
near-native rust performance while still having the ease of writing
Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on the increased involvement of Rust in the Python
ecosystem. It will also demonstrate why Robyn was created, the technical
decisions behind Robyn, the increased performance by using the Rust
runtime, how to use Robyn to develop web apps, and most importantly, how
the community is helping Robyn grow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will briefly demonstrate my experience and challenges of building a
community around the project and how it allowed Robyn to ensure a smooth
sail even in turbulent situations. I shall also share my future plans
for Robyn.&lt;/p&gt;
