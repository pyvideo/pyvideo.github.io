know that throughput efficiency is one of the top priority items in the
Python ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the extensibility and ease of use of the Python Web
ecosystem and the increase of performance by using Rust as a core, Robyn
was created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn is one of the fastest Python web frameworks in the current Python
web ecosystem. With a runtime written in Rust, Robyn achieves
near-native rust performance while still having the ease of writing
Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on the increased involvement of Rust in the Python
ecosystem. It will also demonstrate why Robyn was created, the technical
decisions behind Robyn, the increased performance by using the Rust
runtime, how to use Robyn to develop web apps, and most importantly, how
the community is helping Robyn grow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will briefly demonstrate my experience and challenges of building a
community around the project and how it allowed Robyn to ensure a smooth
sail even in turbulent situations. I shall also share my future plans
for Robyn.&lt;/p&gt;
