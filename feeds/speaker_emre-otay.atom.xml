&lt;p&gt;Unlike few 16-year-olds out there, we have been in the unique position
of experiencing computer science education both as students and as
educators. Having both learned Python from other students, and taught it
in a workshop to others, it is clear to us that one of the best ways to
enhance a computer science education is through peer learning. Students
usually have a knack for explaining things to their peers in a way that
is approachable and understandable. (Although the presence of a teacher
as a moderator is crucial in peer learning, it is often easier for
students to relate to someone their own age.) Even if there’s no direct
explaining involved, working together with another student can lead to
enlightening discussions. We’d like to share our experiences with peer
learning with other educators to encourage them to implement similar
practices in their own classrooms, hopefully paving the way to an even
more effective computer science education.&lt;/p&gt;
