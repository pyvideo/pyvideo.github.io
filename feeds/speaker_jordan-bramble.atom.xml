engineering to detect and localize the absence of signatures in legal
documents. This talk is targeted towards attendees with some familiarity
with computer vision who are interested in an applied case study,
learning how to leverage deep learning with small amounts of data, or
applying computer vision to text documents.&lt;/p&gt;
