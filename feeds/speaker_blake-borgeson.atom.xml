&lt;p&gt;Despite our knowledge that the vast majority of life's processes at a
cellular level are carried out by complexes of multiple proteins,
knowledge of all the complexes formed in a cell and their members is a
distant goal. By using a new approach first applied to human cell lines
by collaborators Havugimana and Hart, et al, consisting of 1) subjecting
biological samples to many levels of many types of fractionations, 2)
using mass spectrometry to quantify protein levels in each fraction, and
3) processing the data through a machine learning pipeline, we are able
to seek complexes using a high-throughput all-by-all approach. By
incorporating additional functional genomic information into our
learning process, we are able to reconstruct maps of complexes that
rival in quality and far surpass in coverage those generated with
previously-used, much more labor-intensive methods such as affinity
purification followed by mass spectrometry, or AP-MS. Here, using 6,000
mass spectrometry experiments from more than 60 fractionated biological
samples from human, mouse, sea urchin, fly and worm, we predict with
high confidence hundreds (~500) of expected and putative novel conserved
complexes. IPython, SciPy, and scikit-learn are the foundational tools
used to handle data integration and machine learning, and an integrated
python environment for this work has been critical to the speed of
progress.&lt;/p&gt;
