tool-set to aid in assessing the response of the UK's Advanced Gas
Reactor nuclear power stations to earthquakes. The seismic analyses
themselves are carried out with a commercial Finite Element solver, but
understanding the raw data this produces requires customised
post-processing and visualisation tools. Extending the existing tools
had become increasingly difficult and a decision was made to develop a
new, Python-based tool-set. This comprises of a post-processing
framework (&amp;quot;aftershock&amp;quot;) which includes an an embedded Python
interpreter, and a plotting package (&amp;quot;afterplot&amp;quot;) based on numpy and
matplotlib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new tool-set had to be significantly more flexible and easier to
maintain than the existing code-base, while allowing the majority of
development to be carried out by engineers with little training in
software development. The resulting architecture will be described with
a focus on exploring how the design drivers were met and the successes
and challenges arising from the choices made.&lt;/p&gt;
