&lt;p&gt;Presented by Wesley J. Chun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about the evolution of Python. We will discuss Python 2 and
Python 3: what the compatibility issues are, what the main differences
are, and also talk about migration, Python 2.6, and other transition
tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by wesley chun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about the evolution of Python. We will discuss Python 2 and
Python 3: what the compatibility issues are, what the main differences
are, and also talk about migration, Python 2.6/2.7, and other transition
tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is currently at a crossroads: Python 2 has taken it from a quiet
word- of-mouth language to primetime, with many companies around the
world using it and an ever-increasing global marketshare of the
programming world. But now comes Python 3, the first version of the
language that is not backwards compatible with previous releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Are all my Python programs going to break? Will I
have to rewrite everything? How much time do I have? When is Python 2
going to be EOL'd? Is the language undergoing a complete rewrite and
will I even recognize it? What are the changes between Python 2 and 3
anyway? Also, the next generation is already here, as Python 3 is over
two years old now. What has been ported so far, and what is its current
status? Are migration plans or transition tools available? If I want to
start learning Python, should I do Python 2 or Python 3? Are all Python
2 books obsolete?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will attempt to answer all of these questions and more. Join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OUTLINE/TOPICS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python 2 vs. Python 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to Python 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backwards Compatibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generational Changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key Differences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role of Remaining Python 2.x releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transition &amp;amp; Migration Plans &amp;amp; Tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Futures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
