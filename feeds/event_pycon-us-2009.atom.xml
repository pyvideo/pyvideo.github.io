application is typically an evolutionary process. You experiment and
find things that work, and things that don't, particularly if you have
little programming experience. Sometimes, you proceed down a path that
binds your hands later down the road, and a massive refactor is needed.
I would like to present a simple testing framework built upon several
existing, free technologies (ConfigObj, twill, nose) and models (Page
Objects, Scenario Objects, Abstract State Machines) that is easy to
configure, extend, and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When faced with the simple task of figuring out how to use configuration
to your advantage in Python there are a myriad of methods. The purpose
of this talk is to walk through the standard library modules and the
popular Python Package Index modules comparing and contrasting
configuration formats and the code that consumes them. Specifically, I
would like to walk through the use of the csv module, the ConfigParser
module, ConfigObj, lxml, PyYaml and SimpleJSON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented at PyCon 2009 by David Beazley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a programmer who cares about Python and concurrency, then you
should also care about Python coroutines. Although they were first
introduced in Python 2.5, coroutines remain one of Python's most
overlooked features--- often vaguely described as a curious &amp;quot;extension&amp;quot;
of generator functions with little insight as to how they might be
applied to real-world problems. This tutorial examines coroutines in a
more practical light by showing how they are actually a very elegant way
to implement a processing &amp;quot;task.&amp;quot; Using this task abstraction, it is
possible to use coroutines to implement processing pipelines, event
handling systems, and programs based on cooperative multitasking.
Moreover, if you define tasks using coroutines, they can be easily
incorporated into more traditional concurrent programs that utilize
threads or message passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Django is a high-level web development framework designed for rapid
development of database-backed web sites. Since its release three years
ago Django's grown by leaps and bounds; it's now part of a highly
successful new generation of web development tools.&lt;/p&gt;

framework, and the final release of Jython 2.5 should be available a
couple of months before PyCon. This means we can now use a modern Python
web framework on top of Java infrastructure by running Django on Jython.
In this talk, we will show examples of how to use this combination,
engage a discussion about what can take the Python (and Django)
community from the Java world, especially the necessary infrastructure
bits, and how a Django/Jython stack compares with other JVM web stacks
like JRuby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

Wondering how to repeatably pull
together collections of packages into standalone development, testing
and deployment environments, all while managing inter-dependencies? In
this participatory tutorial, we'll start with distutils, walk through
using eggs in the cheeseshop and creating your own eggs, touch a bit on
using virtualenv to set up a development environment, and then dig into
using zc.buildout to rigorously control assembly specifications, with
build recipes, versioning and dependency management. We'll close by
showing how to create your own recipes. Attendees are strongly

&lt;p&gt;This half-day tutorial presents intermediate and some advanced features
of Python to beginning and intermediate programmers. It pairs well with
Python 101 following a similar outline but at a deeper level. Rather
than starting with &amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;, we use the interactive Python
interpreter to get hands- on familiarity with much of core Python before
covering blocks and scripts. The tutorial is divided into short

&lt;p&gt;There is a distinct lack of Design Patterns discussed in relation to
Python. Are the communities ignorant of Design Patterns or is there
something else going on here? This talk is based on my well-trafficked
article &amp;quot;Python isn't just Java without the compile&amp;quot; and expands on that
article by using Design Patterns as a crude metric of gaps in a

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Chris McDonough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you a Python web developer who thinks there might be some great
stuff hidden away in Zope but you consider it inaccessible to you
because you feel that Zope imposes too many foreign concepts for your
tastes? Are you a more- or-less happy Zope developer that has the
nagging feeling that much of Zope is unnecessary &amp;quot;baggage&amp;quot; on your
current project? Maybe you're a Plone developer who feels that Plone is
unsuitable for one of your current projects because it's too
complicated? This tutorial will present everything you need to know
about repoze.bfg, a small Python web framework in the spirit of Pylons.
The goals of repoze.bfg are simplicity, familiarity to Zope programmers
(but no Zope experience is required), execution speed, and complete,
comprehensive, and up-to-date documentation. In this tutorial, we'll
explain the core concepts in repoze.bfg, then we'll lead a guided
development session where we make a small application using the
framework. We'll also cover packaging and deployment of the application.
Questions are highly encouraged during the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

having to re-create the same content in multiple places in your web
application it might be time to look at ToscaWidgets. ToscaWidgets gives
the developer the ability to create reusable web content. This 3 hour
lesson will cover installation, integration, and usage of ToscaWidgets.
After we have a handle on how to create validated forms with
ToscaWidgets, we will spend the second half of this lesson creating a
working ajax widget, which we will test the client side component using
ToscaWidget javascript technology.&lt;/p&gt;

for many. In this interactive tutorial, I will cover both the basics of
deferreds and many non-trivial use-cases, with discussion of various
approaches. Common mistakes, gotchas and other issues will be explained,
as well as good idioms and techniques to use deferreds without pain.
Deferreds bring asynchronous APIs the clarity and programming power that
is sometimes lost when using event-based programming. They are an idea
taken from many other programming languages, and made into a Pythonic
solution If you are using Twisted, or would like to use Twisted, this
tutorial can help you with one of the most subtle issues inherent in its
APIs - Deferreds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Holger Krekel and Maciej Fijalkowski&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPy has come a long way. It's gone from being purely a research project
to providing a flexible and reasonably fast Python Interpreter, itself
implemented in Python. Although PyPy is not yet a viable CPython
replacement, PyPy is able to run sophisticated python applications like
Django and Twisted. In this talk, we'll focus on improvements that
happened during the last year in PyPy. This talk will also explain the
motivations driving current PyPy development and its targets for the
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 2 part tutorial presents the basics of Python to beginning and
intermediate programmers. It pairs well with Python 102 which follows a
similar outline but goes much deeper. Rather than starting with &amp;quot;Hello,
world!&amp;quot;, we use the interactive Python interpreter to get hands-on
familiarity with much of core Python before covering blocks and scripts.
The tutorial is divided into short sections, each with presentation and
exercises, to quickly cover lots of ground. Advanced topics are
introduced throughout and covered in &amp;quot;extra credit&amp;quot; exercises such that
more advanced participants can learn at their own pace.&lt;/p&gt;

Together let us explore
the various modules, which will help you to build robust working
programs. Once you know about a particular library well, you will start
replacing those 20 odd lines of code you used to write with a 2-3 lines
and feel safe that your code will now work on all the platforms that
Python supports. Just like the galaxy, the Python Standard Library is
vast and when hitch-hiking I will take you through some important ones
that happen to be used most often. You can explore, ask questions,
experiment through out the ride. Welcome! And let the journey begin.&lt;/p&gt;
