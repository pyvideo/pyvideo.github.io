&lt;p&gt;This talk will have special meaning for Final Fantasy fans, but anyone with nerdy non-coding hobbies should be able to enjoy it. The intended outcome is for attendees to see their own hobbies in a new light, where they can find their own abstract lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMO gaming is becoming a more mainstream hobby, and as a lifelong gamer, I have plenty of experiences and stories to share on how the genre helped my transformation from a shy bundle of nerves to a confident professional. I also have experience applying my problem solving skills from software development into solutions for the community to combat problems that arose within the game.&lt;/p&gt;
