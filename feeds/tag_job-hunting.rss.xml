&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you're bored at your current job. Perhaps you're new to the tech job market. Perhaps your company lost funding and you were laid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a million reasons why, but one common element: Sometimes we all have to play the job hunt game. And the game sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From unresponsive recruiters to pointless interview questions, a job hunt can be a demoralizing and dehumanizing process, but there are a lot of things which you can do to make it more productive and less stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding the good job postings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resume and Cover Letter dos and don'ts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize Organize Organize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You rule the interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negotiating the offer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
