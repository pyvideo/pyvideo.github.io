do you think this will take you?&amp;quot;  Without tons of experience and deep self-
awareness, it's always hard to size up a data project.  Even with
experience, sometimes there are spectacular failures.  Let's have a fun
discussion about a few key ways to size up a project, including how to ask
good scoping questions, how to budget for unexpected and time-consuming
scenarios.  The discussion will also be liberally sprinkled with personal
anecdotes of scoping failures from my career as a data freelancer.&lt;/p&gt;
