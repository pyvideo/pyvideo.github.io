artificial intelligence has pushed the limits of existing systems for
distributed computing. We introduce Ray, a new system designed to
support these workloads and to provide the required scalability,
flexibility, and fault tolerance. Ray provides a lightweight API based
on dynamic task graphs and actors to flexibly express a wide range of
applications. We discuss architectural and API design decisions and show
how to build high-performance applications on top of Ray. The code is
