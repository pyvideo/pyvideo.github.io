within your reach with the use of third party kits such as Kivy and the
Pygame Subset for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kivy is an &amp;quot;Open source Python library for rapid development of
applications&amp;quot; and comes with tools which allow Kivy based programs to be
packaged as Android apks for deployment to Android devices. In this
session I will give an overview of the Kivy development and deployment
process. I will also draw inspiration from my successes and failures in
developing Python programs with Kivy to highlight Kivy's strengths,
weaknesses and idiosyncracies. Code examples will be kept to a minimum,
with a focus on illustrating the capabilities of the Kivy library and
explaining how its parts work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also reserve some time to discuss the Pygame Subset for Android
and how it can be used to deploy Pygame based games to Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;

We are in the midst of a boom in interest in
amateur programming, particularly among children. Brendan spent the most
recent summer past using his blog python4kids.brendanscott.com as
inspiration for a new project based instructional book, Python for Kids
for Dummies (US release by Wiley this northern summer). This talk will
provide an overview of the development cycle for the book both in
respect of the book's content and the process involved in creating that
content and shepherding it through the publisher's internal processes.
Topics to be covered include engaging and negotiating with the
publisher, the different functions provided by a publisher, project
management of the writing, interacting with editorial and technical
reviewers, integrating with an existing &amp;quot;house style&amp;quot;, art requirements
and cross platform issues. In relation to content, Brendan will discuss
the thought that went into targeting the material to a kids audience and
the challenges involved in structuring a narrative which wends its way
through each of the concepts that need to be introduced and providing a
motivation for each of them. This includes how the content was
structured, what concepts were included and what were passed over,
trying to balance material to maintain interest without overwhelming the
readers, the tension between explanation and demonstration and how to
remain mindful of the audience's limitations. The highs, the lows, the
triumphs (getting it done!) and tragedies (whole chapters consigned to
the pyre), it's all here.&lt;/p&gt;
