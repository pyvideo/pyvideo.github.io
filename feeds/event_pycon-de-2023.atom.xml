Today, you can write high performance code in Julia instead, which is much much easier for Python users. This tutorial will give you hands-on experience writing a Python library that incorporates Julia for performance optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia is a modern data science language which solves the two-language problem by being both easy to use and high performant. Although different from Python, the language can be quickly learned by Python users, making it a good choice for speeding up pieces of code. Julia, in addition to being a similar language, is designed for high-performance applied mathematics and has high-quality libraries for multi-dimensional arrays, dataframes, distributed computing and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older alternative of writing pieces of code in C, C++, Cython or Rust is much more cumbersome: Here, programmers have to cope with a low-level language, static types, pointers, no garbage collector, lack of scientific libraries and other difficulties not normally faced by Python users. There was simply no better alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial will be fully hands-on, using Jupyter Notebook and Binder to provide a smooth and easy-to-use environment for each participant. Both Julia and Python work seamlessly within Jupyter. We start with an introduction to the basics of Julia, focusing on the core differences with Python and how to work around common translation difficulties. Then we'll take a look at the interfaces between Julia and Python and build a Python sample project that runs Julia code. Finally, we will benchmark our solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tutorial you will be able to use Julia to speed up your Python code.&lt;/p&gt;

Besides of all security and safety concerns that usually are not addressed from the very beginning when playing around with an algorithmic idea, performance concerns are quite frequently a reason for not taking the Python code to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will look at the &amp;quot;missing performance&amp;quot; worries using a simple numerical problem and how to speed the corresponding Python code up to top notch performance.&lt;/p&gt;

Python offers decorator to implement re-usable code for cross-cutting task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is an in-depth introduction to decorators.
It covers the usage of decorators and how to implement simple and more advanced decorators. Use cases demonstrate how to work with decorators.
In addition to showing how functions can use closures to create decorators,
the tutorial introduces callable class instance as alternative.
Class decorators can solve problems that use be to be tasks for metaclasses. The tutorial provides uses cases for class decorators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the focus is on best practices and practical applications, the tutorial
also provides deeper insight into how Python works behind the scene.
After the tutorial participants will feel comfortable with functions that take
functions and return new functions.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the main advantages of BLE is that everybody can integrate those devices into their tools or projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, BLE is not the most developer-friendly protocol and these devices most of the time don't come with good documentation. In addition, there are not a lot of good open-source tools, examples, and tutorials on how to use Python with BLE. Especially if one wants to build both sides of the communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will introduce the concepts and properties used in BLE interactions and look at how we can use the Linux Bluetooth Stack (Bluez) to communicate with other devices. We will look at a simple example and learn along the way about common pitfalls and debugging options while working with BLE and Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for everybody that has a basic understanding of Python and wants to have a deeper understanding of how BLE works and how one could use it in a private project.&lt;/p&gt;

The size of their models, libraries and necessary files can be challenging, especially in a microservice environment. When services should be built as lightweight and slim as possible, large (language) models can lead to a lot of problems. With a recent real-world use case as an example, which runs productively for over a year and in 10 different languages, I will walk you through my experiences with deploying NLP models. What kind of pitfalls, shortcuts, and tricks are possible while bringing an NLP model to production?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you will learn about different ways and possibilities to deploy NLP services. I will speak briefly about the way leading from data to model and a running service (without going into much detail) before I will focus on the MLOps part in the end. I will take you with me on my past journey of struggles and successes so that you don't need to take these detours by yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

In We are going to explore the Ports and Adapters(Hexagonal) pattern by showing a simple web app using Repository, Unit of Work, and Services(Use Cases) patterns tied together with Dependency Injection. All those patterns are quite famous in other languages but they are relatively new for the Python ecosystem, which is a crucial missing part.
As a web framework, we are going to use FastAPI which can be replaced with any framework in a matter of time because of the abstractions we have added.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, your notebook looks anything but production grade. The good news is, there's finally a cure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-source python package LineaPy aims to automate data science workflow generation and expediting the process of going from data science development to production. And truly, it transforms messy notebooks into data pipelines like Apache Airflow, DVC, Argo, Kubeflow, and many more. And if you can't find your favorite orchestration framework, you are welcome to work with the creators of LineaPy to contribute a plugin for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you will learn the basic concepts of LineaPy and how it supports your everyday tasks as a data practitioner. For this purpose, we will transform a notebook step by step together to create a DVC pipeline. Finally, we will discuss what place LineaPy will take in the MLOps universe. Will you only have to check in your notebook in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

For it to succeed and thrive you can't expect it to be isolated from the world. You need to establish trade routes, offer your products to other islands, and import items from them. Doing this will certainly make your economy grow! We're not going to talk about land masses or commerce, however, you should think of your application as an island that needs to connect to other applications to succeed. Unfortunately, the sea is treacherous and is not always very consistent, similar to the networks you use to connect your application to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will explore some techniques and libraries in the Python ecosystem used to make your life easier while dealing with external services. From asynchronicity, caching, testing, and building abstractions on top of the APIs you consume, you will definitely learn some strategies to build your connected application gracefully, and avoid those pesky 2 AM errors that keep you awake.&lt;/p&gt;

The demographic of the contributors to these libraries is predominantly white and male. This situation creates problems not only for individual contributors outside of this demographic but also for open source projects such as loss of career opportunities and less robust technologies. In recent years there have been a number of various recommendations and initiatives to increase the participation in open source projects of groups who are underrepresented in this domain. While these efforts are valuable and much needed, contributor diversity remains a challenge in open source communities. This talk highlights the underlying problems and explores how we can overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;

Post execution, it notifies the main thread about the completion or failure of the worker thread. There are numerous benefits to using it, such as improved application performance, enhanced responsiveness, and effective usage of CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asynchronicity seems to be a big reason why Node.js is so popular for server-side programming. Most of the code we write, especially in heavy IO applications like websites, depends on external resources. This could be anything from a remote database POST API call. As soon as you ask for any of these resources, your code is waiting around for process completion with nothing to do. With asynchronous programming, you allow your code to handle other tasks while waiting for these other resources to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we are going to talk about asynchronous programming in Python. Its benefits and multiple ways to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;

It was voted in as they felt they were &amp;quot;unbalanced and not seeing the true spectrum of the greater community&amp;quot;. And thought that with time they could &amp;quot;advance towards a more diverse representation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that a big thing? Codes of conduct are an important part of any community, outlining the values of the community. They establish clear guidelines for acceptable behavior and help to create a safe and inclusive environment in the community. This can prevent discrimination and promote equal opportunities for all members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will explore the role of code of conduct in communities, it's history in the PSF, and discuss strategies for rethinking what it means to have and enforce a Code of Conduct. We will look at the existing challenges that the Python communities face when implementing codes of conduct and talk about possible solutions. How does it look like when it works well and when it doesn't?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an essential part of any open source project, reflecting on these guidelines can help to ensure that the projects are successful and sustainable in the long term. Thinking back to Python, which also turns 20 in 2023: &amp;quot;Python got to where it is by being open, and it'll continue to prosper by remaining open&amp;quot;. It's important we continue this mission, after all, one of the things many people love about Python is the community.&lt;/p&gt;

Rust, on the other hand, is known for its lightning-fast runtime and low-level control, making it an attractive option for speeding up performance-sensitive portions of Python programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will present a case study of using Rust to speed up a critical component of a Python application. We will cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of Rust and its benefits for Python developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profiling and identifying performance bottlenecks in Python application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing a solution in Rust and integrating it with the Python application using PyO3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measuring the performance improvements and comparing them to other optimization techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We will compare and contrast the syntax and implementation of these constructs in each language and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We will also look at real-world examples of how these features are used in each language to specify behavior, and consider differences in terms of type system expressiveness and effectiveness. By the end of the talk, attendees will have a better understanding of the differences and similarities between these three language features, and will be able to make informed decisions about which one is best suited for their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

Because of this, it's critical to identify the key areas to focus our efforts, so we can ensure our machine learning pipelines are reliable and scalable. In this talk we dive into the state of production machine learning in the Python Ecosystem, and we will cover the concepts that make production machine learning so challenging, as well as some of the recommended tools available to tackle these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover key principles, patterns and frameworks around the open source frameworks powering single or multiple phases of the end-to-end ML lifecycle, incluing model training, deploying, monitoring, etc. We will be covering a high level overview of the production ML ecosystem and dive into best practices that have been abstracted from production use-cases of machine learning operations at scale, as well as how to leverage tools to that will allow us to deploy, explain, secure, monitor and scale production machine learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

I will shed some light on the multiple sources of biases in data applications: Where are potential pitfalls and how can we prevent, detect and mitigate them early so they never become a risk for our data product. I will walk you through the different stages of a data product lifecycle and dive deeper into the questions we as data professionals have to ask ourselves throughout the process. Furthermore, I will present methods, tools and libraries that can support our work. Being well aware that there is no universal solution as tools and strategies need to be chosen to specifically address requirements of the use-case and models at hand, my talk will provide a good starting point for your own data ethics journey.&lt;/p&gt;
