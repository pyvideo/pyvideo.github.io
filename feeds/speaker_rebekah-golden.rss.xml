&lt;p&gt;A fundamental understanding of algorithms is good not only for writing solid code but also for that pesky part of an interview where you're asked to white board psuedocode for a story problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a beginner level talk for people who want to learn to relax and love algorithms. Come learn how to break down an activity like making a quiche into an algorithm. Or come learn how to make a quiche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is welcome. Python quiche recipe provided with slides, sorry no quiche.&lt;/p&gt;
