&lt;p&gt;The Genetic Algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm inspired by Charles
Darwinâ€™s theory of natural selection. It may be one of the most popular
biologically inspired algorithms. In this talk, you will discover how a
genetic optimization algorithm works and how to implement it from
scratch in Python. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a stochastic global search
optimization algorithm inspired by the biological theory of evolution.
It is commonly used to find solutions to search and optimization
problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will explain how GAs work going through a Python example
implemented from scratch. I will show how the genetic algorithm,
starting from a population of candidate solutions repeatedly evolves
them toward better solutions trying to solve an optimization problem. I
will illustrate a Python implementation of the main biologically
inspired operators of GAs such as selection, crossover and mutation.
Finally, I will mention limitations and variants of genetic algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the talk, you will be able to implement your own genetic algorithm
and apply it to solve a large variety of optimization problems,
especially those that are not well suited for standard optimization
techniques, like problems in which the objective function is
non-differentiable or highly non-linear.&lt;/p&gt;
