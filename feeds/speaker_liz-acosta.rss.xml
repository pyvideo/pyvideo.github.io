This talk hopes to change your mind about testing and offer strategies to make those vegetables taste a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

Wherever you fall on the spectrum, as a developer, you likely won’t be able to avoid AI.And yes, you still have to write your unit tests – more so now than ever.This talk hopes to help you strike the right balance between leveraging and leaning on AI by stepping through different strategies for approaching unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;

writing good and – most importantly – relevant tests in Python. While
the advent of APIs has made using external services so much more
accessible, APIs can lead to flaky or deceptive tests, ultimately
putting applications at risk. In this talk, you will learn how to use
Python’s Mock object to create more reliable stand-ins for APIs beyond
your control … all within the unittest framework.&lt;/p&gt;
