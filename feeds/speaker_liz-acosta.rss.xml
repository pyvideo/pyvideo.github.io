writing good and – most importantly – relevant tests in Python. While
the advent of APIs has made using external services so much more
accessible, APIs can lead to flaky or deceptive tests, ultimately
putting applications at risk. In this talk, you will learn how to use
Python’s Mock object to create more reliable stand-ins for APIs beyond
your control … all within the unittest framework.&lt;/p&gt;
