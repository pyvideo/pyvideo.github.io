Writing code to clean data or make visualizations seems categorically different from building robust &amp;quot;software&amp;quot; on which other people rely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll show why that distinction is not necessarily true by discussing my personal experience from learning R in graduate school to reporting bugs on GitHub to becoming a co-author of the tidycensus package and a practicing data scientist. The positive and supportive R community on GitHub, Twitter, and elsewhere contributes to why anyone who writes R code can become a package author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have not actually gotten rich but I did get freelance data work based on my package contributions!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
