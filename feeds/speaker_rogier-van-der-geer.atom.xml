But while it seems everyone is
using them, training your first neural network can be quite a hurdle to
overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will take you by the hand, and following an example image
classifier I trained, I will take you through the steps of making an
image classifier in PyTorch. I will show you code snippets and explain
the more intricate parts. Also, I will tell you about my experience, and
about what mistakes to prevent. After this all you need to start
training your first classifier is a data set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I will provide a link to the full codebase at the end. The
talk will focus on the practical aspect of training a neural network,
and will only touch the theoretical side very briefly. Some basic prior
knowledge of neural networks is beneficial, but not required, to follow
this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training a genetic algorithm to play the game of Risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular board game of Risk has many fans around the world. Using a Python-based simulation of the game, we use a genetic algorithm to train a risk-playing algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk we’ll explain what genetic algorithms are and we’ll explain an entertaining use-case: how to win at popular board games. During the talk we’ll demo how object oriented patterns help with the design and implementation of these algorithms. We’ll also demonstrate a library that allows users to push their own risk bots into a game and battle it out on.&lt;/p&gt;
