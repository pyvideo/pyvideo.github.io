rewrite of about 1000 pages of documentation - changing the markup
language, the focus (feature to user story), and the structure (linear
to modular) - without actually being in charge of strategy, scheduling,
tooling, or content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk charts the process and provides recommendations for others
attempting to instigate massive change on multiple fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

that feels human, helpful, and how we know if it’s successful. Part of
that experience bridges the information gap between the messages you
receive before you log into an Atlassian product and the messages you
receive in the form of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introductory states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blank states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Directional and instructive text in the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI copy and it's connection to user expectations and perceptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation and how it supports different functional journeys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll cover how working ahead of time with our marketing, content, and
brand teams allows us to know and influence user expectations throughout
their early journey. We’ll also talk about how far we have yet to go.&lt;/p&gt;

It's those
moments that encourage industries to become better regulated, in order
to prevent further disasters. The IT industry has had many moments that
could be considered consequential enough to encourage better regulation,
but the changes have never been made. Because the industry has avoided
effective regulation for so long, it is possible that we are hurtling
towards a disaster of epic proportions, one that we haven't even managed
to conceive of yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will go through some historical examples of disasters
leading to regulation in other industries, and the measures that were
put into place to mitigate the problem. I will also address some of the
major moments from the IT industry that should have prompted regulation,
and haven't. Finally, I will discuss ways that documentation
professionals are uniquely placed to identify, and potentially blow the
whistle on, potential disasters before they happen.&lt;/p&gt;

We are the guards
of the mystical “good” code and defenders against evil technical debt.
It’s universally agreed that it’s easy to spot “bad” code and much
harder to determine “good” code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to share some of my experiences working on a team producing a
large amount of code every day, with few reviewers. We’ll dive into
looking for smart architectural and design decisions, coherently
understanding what problem the author intended to solve and
understanding how they implemented a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll touch on automating away the most common issues within Code Review
and pulling the technical brains out of your team mates into great
documentation. Most importantly we’ll talk about the human side of code
review and how to manage code review within large and small teams. Code
review helps our teams grow institutional knowledge and shared
understanding of the systems we build together. A strong understanding
of how to review code will help you to write better code and help you
help your teammates to write better code.&lt;/p&gt;

There seem to be too many
questions and not enough answers, and so much assumed knowledge about
the company you joined and the products they make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to talk about how you can make those first few weeks your most
productive and valuable to your new company. By writing internal
documentation that answers all the questions only someone new on the
block knows to ask, you can help pave the way for new hires in the
future, and even help identify and solve customer pain points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from my own experiences working as an intern and support agent
among highly technical teams, I will go over deciding what to document
based on the level of technical proficiency you would expect the reader
to have, how to use tone to convey the company’s spirit and keep a
future reader interested, and how to future-proof your internal
documentation so it doesn’t stop being updated when you move on.&lt;/p&gt;

They know documentation is
important, and they love to refer customers to it, but finding time to
actually write and maintain those documents is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That endless support queue and its ceaseless demand for attention mean
that documentation is too often ignored. Mat shares his hard earned
practical advice to help technical writers and support team knowledge
base owners create a more effective documentation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn why documentation falls behind, how to reduce support writing
friction and how other SaaS teams have made support an engine for great
documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

ways to present that content to readers on a vast array of devices and
hardware has been even more problematic. This session will explore best
practices for enabling your content to automatically adapt to various
computers, browsers, devices, and platforms. This is a rapidly changing
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation Mike will cover the most recent developments in the
industry that have made responsive content presentation much easier for
content authors. Mike will visit the concept of Media Queries and
compare that with the newer and easier techniques such as using the
FlexBox Model. It has never been easier to ensure that your content is
presented to your reader in an optimized manner.&lt;/p&gt;

hands, a style guide is a necessity. It can provide consistent quality
across documents, and over time it can lift the writing standard within
your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will aim to cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does your style guide need to contain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the pitfalls that you need to consider?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you communicate the style guide across the organisation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

To do this, you need information from other
people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that they're too busy, or in another office, or another timezone,
or they just don't want to help. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will look at the psychology behind why we often don't get the
help we ask for, how we can work with what we've got, and ways we can
get information out of unwilling participants, in spite of themselves!&lt;/p&gt;

includes microcopy for the user interfaces. However, that is not
correct. Writing snappy messages on the UI is only a part of it; more
important aspect is developing a voice for the product and imbibing that
voice in your content (UX, help, knowledge base, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers some of the necessary skills required for being good at
UX writing and how these skills help us in designing a better product
experience. Whether be it the decision of keeping the tone professional
vs casual or using title case vs sentence case, decisions must be taken
based on the audience and should always be in-context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yea, one last thing, technical writers are/can be great UX writers!&lt;/p&gt;

are turning to static site generators like Jekyll, Sphynx, Hugo, or
GitBook to turn that 'code' into user-facing documentation websites. In
this mini- workshop, you'll get an introduction to the static site
generator landscape, and apply what you learn by publishing your own
site in class. We'll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How static site generators work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison of popular generators, with guidelines for choosing one
for your next project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands-on editing and publishing of your own statically generated
portfolio website&lt;/li&gt;
