completely open-source, and at every stage we've focused on making it
usable not just with LSST, but with generic astronomical image data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors: Bosch, Jim, Princeton University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track: Astronomy and Astrophysics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is a 8.4-meter survey telescope that
will image the entire visible sky twice a week with a 3.2 Gigapixel
camera, expected to come online early in the next decade. That means a
lot of data: approximately 30 TB each night, and over 60 PB at the end
of the 10-year survey, all of which will be made available to the
public. The software system for LSST is completely open-source, and at
every stage we've focused on making it usable not just with LSST, but
with generic astronomical image data (in fact, it has been used to
reduce data from several other telescopes already). We're building the
software system for LSST using a combination of C++ and Python, making
use of third-party software such as NumPy, Swig, and Eigen, along with a
lot of custom code (much of which may be of broader use). In this talk
I'll go over some of the advantages and disadvantages of the C++/Python
combination, and some of the tricks and tools we've developed (and
trials and tribulations we've encountered) in making them play well
together in the context of astronomical data analysis. While LSST is
still years away, and our software pipeline is still in many ways a
prototype, in many respects it is already at the cutting edge of
astronomical data analysis, and the lessons we have already learned will
be of value not just to astronomers, but to scientists in other &amp;quot;big
data&amp;quot; fields and general-purpose scientific software developers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
