How can we effectively engage with Pfizer R users and celebrate the successes of this community, while sharing best practices? Additionally, how do we avoid isolated groups duplicating efforts to solve R-related problems across different parts of the organization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, we established the Pfizer R Center of Excellence (CoE) in early 2022. We focus our efforts on bringing together a rapidly growing community of colleagues, providing technical expertise, and offering best-practice guidance. A well-established, maintained and engaged R community promotes an inclusive and supportive learning environment that drives innovation within organizations. Our aim is to help colleagues thrive in their R journey, regardless of their expertise level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my talk, I will share the techniques we used to build a supportive R community, the tools employed to increase community engagement, and the successes and challenges encountered in building an engaging community of R users.&lt;/p&gt;
