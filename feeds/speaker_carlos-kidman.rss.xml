&lt;p&gt;Zillow lost millions because they didn’t have proper MLOps or testing
processes. They relied on the training metrics, like accuracy, but
Software Quality goes beyond that. I will cover different testing types,
techniques, and concepts that you can apply to make high-quality ML
Systems. As ML/AI systems are becoming more prevalent, the need for
setting quality standards and testing practices has become crucial.
Testing these models goes beyond validation metrics like accuracy,
precision, and recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, quality attributes like model Behaviors, Usability, and
Fairness need to be tested and measured using exploratory and automated
strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll cover some of the risks and biases that can happen
throughout the MLOps pipeline, demonstrate a few techniques to test a
model’s behaviors and fairness, and apply them against some real-world
scenarios and state-of-the-art models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end, you will have new ideas and techniques that you can use to
test your own ML/AI systems and approach these quality attributes from a
customer’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
