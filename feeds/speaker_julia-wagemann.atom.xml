Computational notebooks, including Jupyter, are in particular valued for facilitating reproducibility and collaboration. However, quantitative analyses and empirical research have identified unique challenges when it comes to using them. Critics claim that notebooks foster bad coding practices due to the possibility of an out-of-order execution of cells, that only a small percentage of notebooks hosted on Github are in fact reproducible and that annotations are not evenly distributed and do not reach the objective of well-described computational narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are the motivation to develop and share best practices to make Jupyter notebooks more educational and reusable. During the development of a Jupyter-based training course on Earth Observation data (Learning Tool for Python (LTPy)), we defined and applied five guiding principles from different fields (mainly scientific computing and Jupyter notebook research) to make these notebooks more educational and reusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jupyter notebooks developed (i) follow the literate programming paradigm by a text/code ratio of 3, (ii) use instructional design elements to improve navigation and user experience, (iii) modularize functions to follow best practices for scientific computing, (iv) leverage the wider Jupyter ecosystem to make content accessible, and (v) aim for being reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will share with you five guiding principles to make Jupyter notebooks educational and reusable and for each principle we share a practical example of how it can be applied and implemented. The guiding principles have also been published in the Journal of Remote Sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

This is enabling new science, services, operational applications and businesses in the fields of meteorology, climate, air quality, oceanography and, at large, environmental monitoring.
TheJupyter ecosystem is becoming central to support users in discovering, using and analysing this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) is an implementer of the Copernicus programme and this talk will show how Jupyter is used to provide know-how and access toCopernicus Earth Observation data on the following aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training and awareness - jupyter-based platforms used in events to self-paced approach over a wide range of domains, including atmosphere, climate change, and marine. For example in 2022 have been held more than 50 international events making use of Jupyter environment with more than 5000 users
Data ready - using jupyter notebooks to showcase applications and grant a seamless access to data - providing notebooks and access to hubs through advanced and open platforms .
Among these, the European Weather Cloud and the WEkEO Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS) as collaboration among key international organisations and agencies (ECMWF, EUMETSAT, EEA and Mercator Ocean International)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communications and outreach- make use of Jupyter to engage with a large public scientifically literate. This includes competition of jupyter notebooks applied to innovative data analysis and access and practical sessions using Jupyter Notebooks in largely attended massive on-line courses (MOOCs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description
Learn how Jupyter Notebooks are a highly beneficial tool for modern geospatial data analysis and for creating reproducible workflows, both for web-based access of large geospatial data and its effective manipulation and geospatial data visualisation with bokeh or jupyter widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Jupyter Notebooks benefit geospatial data analysis in multiple ways since geo data access, manipulation and (interactive) visualisation can be combined in one workflow and programming environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial session presents practical examples of workflows with Jupyter Notebooks for Earth Observation and Climate data analysis. An introduction to Python’s owslib package is given, which will showcase how standardised web services provide a time and cost-efficient way to access and process large volumes of environmental data. Hands-on examples will show how terabytes of open environmental data can be accessed, manipulated and visualized within one workflow without requiring data download. Different Python packages for data visualisation and geospatial data analysis will be harnessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the tutorial is a walk-through session, where participants are able to run the example workflows alongside. In a second part, the participants will get challenged to setup their own geospatial workflow, from data access and manipulation up to data visualization, based on the tools and data services that were presented during the walk-through session&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Session participants require their own laptop with Jupyter installed. We are investigating the feasibility of setting up mybinder or JupyterHub for this workshop. Notebooks will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
