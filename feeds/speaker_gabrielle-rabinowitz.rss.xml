In this talk, we’ll use a new Python and Earth Science curriculum piloted at the American Museum of Natural History as a model to share best practices for teaching Python to young students. We’ll discuss the value of collaborating with content experts, using online tools, and introducing coding concepts with games and hands-on activities. You’ll even get to walk through an example activity yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
