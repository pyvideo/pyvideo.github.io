Studying psychology gave him a great knowledge of marketing, but the combination with Python is a killer for phishing, writing malware, hacking and all the fun stuff. He's doing all of this just as a hobby trying to test and protect his company and his team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get tickets for PyCon Estonia 2020 - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bit.ly/pycon2020"&gt;https://bit.ly/pycon2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is nearing 3 decades in existence (yes, kinda hard to believe). Where do we go from here? We have the same question, hence PyCon 2019 will be a peek into the future of Python. Come, hang out with an inspired crowd, have rich, direct conversations and who knows, maybe you’ll even find an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

From getting people’s Facebook accounts or access to their LastPass accounts to custom written malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat that anyone can steal your customer data is a potential killer of any (financial) company. Being suspicious and aware of all potential phishing attacks and other traps is a must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will look at the practical (dark) examples I have executed and why Python was the best language of choice. From social engineering (sophisticated phishing attacks), custom malware, dropping nasty USB drives on the street to technical/network attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to be really successful in doing social engineering you need to prepare the ultimate user experience. You can not make a mistake and you can not overlook little details (that usually happens if you develop your own apps/websites). Those little details make UX in your app/website awesome (if you are on the good side) but can be exploited pretty easily by the dark side.&lt;/p&gt;
