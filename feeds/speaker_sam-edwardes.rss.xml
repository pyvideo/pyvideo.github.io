Lightning Talk: During this lightning talk I'll present Pooch, an open-source Python library for downloading and catching data files from the web. It provides easy ways to download data files from different protocols, cache it locally, check their integrity through checksums, and more. It also provides tools for downloading collections of files, useful for managing sample datasets for scientific and data-processing Python packages. Currently Pooch is being used by well-known libraries like SciPy, scikit-learn, Xarray and scikit-image, amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;
