But that's not the case when you have to handle a lot of requests on a
large scale. So how do you reduce memory consumption without affecting
the CPU?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I'll discuss about memory management in Python from
the basics, where the necessity for PEP 683 came from, and the changes
introduced by it. I also intend to discuss why this PEP is so important
for the language, and what we'll be able to achieve with it in the
future, such as changes to the GIL and true parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is targeted for folks who are intermediate/advanced
pythonistas. People who are just starting with Python (maybe less than
1.5 years) may feel a bit lost. Even so, curious learners are more than
welcome to join, and I'll try my best to make it easy for all audiences
on this advanced topic. After this presentation, participants will learn
a bit more about how memory management works under the hood in python,
and how it may change in the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

if we take it for a ride then? There is almost no software completely error
free. And catch all of the possible errors is hard, not to say almost
impossible, but what if we use tools that help us bring possible issues to
our attention? Those that might cause security issues, or bad user
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I'll discuss how to get started with fuzz testing: The
art of hitting software with invalid, unexpected, or random data and seeing
how it reacts. I'll present valid scenarios for fixing the bugs found, some
of the existing tools, and how to integrate fuzz testing with our existing
tests.&lt;/p&gt;
