execution in Python. This talk will, after a short introduction to
Celery, share what we learned when we used it as the backbone for the
campaign automation module of Exponea experience cloud. Serving over a
hundred millions of our client's customers across the world with
incredibly diverse use cases, we have heavily used some of Celery's most
obscure functionality in often unintended ways. Join us for a bumpy ride
towards a stability and scalability and learn many insights useful if
you ever need to run some serious asynchronous jobs yourself. Barf bags
not included.&lt;/p&gt;
