typing out large blocks of text. This talk will talk about elements of
fiction writing that improve the process of writing docs: Understanding
audience: the tools fiction writers use to understand their audience (as
well as to communicate with them) offer deeper looks at who reads what.
The process of connecting with an audience is integral to fiction, but
often overlooked in documentation — resulting in hard-to-use docs that
don’t help users. Building story arcs: arguably, all fiction boils down
to about seven different plots, retold in millions of different ways.
Understanding underlying story structure makes the process of writing
new tales much easier. Those story structures and plot elements can map
directly to parts of documentation, as well as show options for creating
standing elements for documentation. * Writing prose worth reading:
documentation can be enjoyable to read, provided a writer is willing to
invest time in crafting good reading material. This talk will draw on
examples from both popular fiction and documentation out in the world
today.&lt;/p&gt;
