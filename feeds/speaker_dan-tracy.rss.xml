were required for deployment. With Pip, Fabric, and Jenkins we've
developed a pipeline to simplify deployments and rollbacks that
dove-tails into configuration management and virtualization. New
machines can come fully deployed and ready to rock at a moments notice
allowing you to scale out nodes quickly and painlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
