The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source environment to write fast code with higher productivity than CUDA, but also with greater flexibility than other existing DSLs. Triton has been adopted as a fundamental component of Torch inductor to synthesize efficient kernels targeting GPUs. This has multiple advantages compared to traditional library usage. It allows for the creation of a wide variety of fusions, it can be tuned independently, and it has a smaller memory footprint. This talk will present the Triton compiler and describe the process that enables it to generate lightning-fast kernels with minimal user effort.&lt;/p&gt;
