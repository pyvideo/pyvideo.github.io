The existence of Docker and Docker compose have reduced the time needed to set up new software and implementing complex technology stacks for our applications. Now, six years after the initial release of Docker, we can say with confidence that containers and containers orchestration have become some of the defaults in the current technology stacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of tutorials and getting started documents for those wanting to adopt Docker for apps deployment. However, if you are a Data Scientist, a researcher or someone working on scientific computing wanting to adopt Docker, the story is quite different. There are very few tutorials (in comparison to app/web) and documents focused on Docker best practices for DS and scientific computing. If you are working on DS, ML or scientific computing, this talk is for you. We'll cover best practices when building Docker containers for data-intensive applications, from optimising your image build, to ensuring your containers are secure and efficient deployment workflows. We will talk about the most common problems faced while using Docker with data intensive applications and how you can overcome most of them. Finally I'll give some practical and useful tips for you to improve your Docker workflows and practises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave the talk feeling confident about adopting Docker across a range of DS, ML and research projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who and Why (audience)
This talk is designed for folks working in data-intensive environments (i.e. Machine Learning, Data Science, research and scientific computing) and that are either using Docker or want to learn more about how to use Docker in these environments. Attendees will leave the talk feeling confident about adopting Docker in their workflows as well as have acquired several best practices and guidelines to do this robustly.

individual’s time is spent preparing data into a digestible format. In
general, a data science pipeline starts with the acquisition of raw data
which is then manipulated through ETL processes and leads to a series of
analytics. Good data pipelines can be used to automate and schedule
these steps, help with monitoring tasks, and even to dynamically train
models. On top of that, they make the analyses easier to reproduce and
productise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, you will learn how to migrate from ‘scripts soups’ (a
set of scripts that should be run in a particular order) to robust,
reproducible and easy-to-schedule data pipelines in Airflow. First, we
will learn how to write simple recurrent ETL pipelines. We will then
integrate logging and monitoring capabilities. And we will end using
Airflow along with Jupyter Notebooks and paper mill to produce
reproducible analytics reports.&lt;/p&gt;
