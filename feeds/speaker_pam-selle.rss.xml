&lt;p&gt;AngularJS is one of, if not the, most popular JavaScript framework out there today. But a new day is coming: The dawn of Angular 2! Angular comes with a robust community and standard of practice, but Angular 2 is something even more intriguing: a JavaScript framework based on components (not unlike React!), with an eye towards complying with future web standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll cover the broad strokes of Angular 2, including some of the big game changers: web components and “choose your own language” support, and how it integrates into back-ends like Django to provide some structure to your front-end. You'll learn about Angular 2's approach to the &amp;quot;JavaScript framework&amp;quot; problem, how components create modularity in your application, and a little bit about the JavaScript build toolchain (mysterious to many!) that the JavaScript world is constantly debating over.&lt;/p&gt;
