&lt;p&gt;“Developing a Security Mindset Practical Lessons for Pythonistas” by Hayley Denbraver&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss why developers should grow their security mindset and will give them practical advice for how to do so—even in a workplace where many issues compete for their attention. Examples will be given from the Python and Django world and should be of interest to those new to security and those wanting to help their team develop a security mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second hour of your day, you may sit down at your desk to write
code that dozens, hundreds, thousands, millions of people interact with
in some way–but what do they know about you, your intentions, and your
training?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A licensed Civil Engineer turned software developer will talk through
how her former field approached ethics–something they have been
iterating on for more than 3000 years. She will discuss how lessons
learned from other engineering professions could apply to software, and
where our industry may need a new approach to ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

Alternatively, you could come to a talk that will demonstrate the basics
of recursion, using fractals drawn by the python turtle module!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are fractals? Fractals are psychedelic designs that appear
basically the same regardless of scale. They also appear all over
nature–consider how a tree trunk and branches is similar in structure to
branches and twigs or how a wave is made of mini waves. Best of all,
fractals can be constructed using recursive functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the turtle module? It is part of the standard python library
that can be used to draw amazing things and is commonly used as a tool
for learning to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come for the recursion, stay for the amazing fractals, and leave knowing
that no turtles were harmed in the making of this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is suitable for all python enthusiasts. Those who love
mathematics will love this talk. Advanced developers will learn more
about a tool that can be used to teach people to code. There is
something for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does Open Source Software factor into this equation? OSS is used
across the industry, but is written and maintained primarily by
volunteers. What are best practices for maintainers, contributors,
individual users, and companies who incorporate open source into their
work? How can we protect ourselves and our users, while still benefiting
from the innovation and collaboration of open source software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers are asked to solve complex problems and balance competing interests--and sometimes security may fall by the wayside. It is easy enough to consider security as &amp;quot;somebody else's problem&amp;quot;, but that attitude can come back to bite us. This talk will cover secure coding practices (for both general Python development and Django development) that you can incorporate into your work.  Every step towards more secure code is a win!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the strange things in the galaxy, the SEP Field might be the strangest. A Somebody Else’s Problem field renders something not invisible, but unnoticed. An SEP field relies on people’s natural disposition not to see anything they don’t want to, weren’t expecting, or can’t explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where might SEP fields be in your software? Where are they in your teams? What intergalactic threat is waiting for you, out in the open but entirely ignored?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, don’t panic. Second, make sure you have your towel. Third, forgive the speaker for her Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy jokes. Finally, confront the problems in front of you. All 42 of them.&lt;/p&gt;
