REST APIs. We'll start with a little introduction of this server and
continue with more complicated possibilities to solve problems uWSGI
was designed to solve. I'll show you how to built a robust app,
capable of serving thousands of requests per second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming in Python in more than a decade. Lukáš used to work on
selling digital content, later spent 6 years in Seznam.cz working on
mobile web and related things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He now works as a Head of R&amp;amp;D of a small company solving problems of
distributing digital content, telco messaging, eCommerce
(radioteka.cz, palmknihy.cz, galerie.vodafone.cz), and mostly an
advertisement management system for a HbbTV layer in TV broadcast…
all of it designed and implemented in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

HbbTV is a standard binding world of linear broadcast and stateless HTTP together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many challenges to correctly handle web content in TVs, especially with a completely different approach from broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show you, how to serve advertisements and measure traffic to hundreds of thousands always connected devices on the single server. With just 40% of devices capable of WebSocket, you have to find ways to get performance elsewhere. Ad targeting and caping in shared memory for linear subscribers on 10+ years old devices with Python and uWSGI.&lt;/p&gt;
