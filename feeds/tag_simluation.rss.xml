As performance hotspots being replaced by C, the software can be organized by using Python for a clear structure. The resulting software provides high flexibility along with high performance. In this talk, SOLVCON, a Python-based software framework for solving conservation laws, is used to demonstrate the approach.&lt;/p&gt;
