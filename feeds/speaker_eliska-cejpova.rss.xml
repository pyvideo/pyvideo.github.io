ocean. It's full of small and nice projects, bigger and nicer ones
and it's also full of uncontrolled collaboration in big repositories.
If you go fishing for the first time, you don't try to catch a shark,
but try to have some luck with trouts in the neighbourhood lake. And
we see how to go for your first fish today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source projects are great opportunity for getting a lot of
experience from community and also how to give something back. But if
you are a new to all of this, you might find it overwhelming. We will
get through some main tips for contributing in beginners-friendly
projects and also starting one of your own. Public contribution will
never feel like a walk of shame!&lt;/p&gt;
