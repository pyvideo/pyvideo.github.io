Join us in this interactive session as we hear from three popular authors about their experiences publishing a book from start to finish. We’ll be joined by Al Sweigart, who’s most popular book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python has been met with rave reviews, April Speight, author of Bite-Size Python and Harry Percival who authored Test Driven Development with Python. They’ll clue you in on what the process is like from start to finish, tips on how to get started if you’d like to write your own book, and warn you of unexpected pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
