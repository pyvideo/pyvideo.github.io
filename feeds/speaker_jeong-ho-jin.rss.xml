I will explain the difficulties of testing due to the nature of deep learning and the dependency problems that occurred during the checkpoint packaging process, and I will tell you what effects you can achieve through Poetry. I hope that this session will be helpful to many deep learning developers as well as developers who want to effectively manage dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
