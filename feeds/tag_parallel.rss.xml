&lt;p&gt;As the complexity and scope of applications grow, it is very common to run into slow performance issues. In Python, it is possible to improve the speed of execution with the use of parallel processing and the Cython compiler. The Jupyter Notebook makes the implementation of both of them a relatively simple task, which will be the focus of this session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dask is a relatively new library for parallel computing in Python. It builds around familiar data structures to users of the PyData stack and enables them to scale up their work on one or many machines. This tutorial will introduce users to the core concepts of dask by working through some example problems. The tutorial will be distributed via Jupyter Notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will introduce ParaView, an open source application
developed by researchers around the world for parallel visualization and
analysis of large scale datasets, which in can be used to visualize and
analyze terabytes of data in real time. ParaView’s core algorithms are
implemented in C/C++ but all its major functionality can be scripted
from python with ease. I’ll give a short introduction to AstroViz, a
parallel visualization tool for astrophysical simulations implemented as
an opensource plugin to ParaView, which I have been lead developer on
since 2009. The focus of the talk will be on driving ParaView from
within python however, both general out of the box use and customized
extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have access to several parallel supercomputers so if there’s a
huge dataset we as a crowd would like to tackle visualizing during the
course of the week that would be fun project. The end of the talk will
be a short brainstorm of cool applications of analysis and visualization
of large scale datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="section" id="contents"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Contents&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is a great language for writing programming frameworks. Python
frameworks are normally addressed to software developers who are Python
professionals. I developed a software package in a scientific
institution, designed to be used by non-programmers, but also designed
to enable customisation through programming by some users. I finally
designed a three level package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Python programming framework, addressed whoever wanted to invest in
Python and had plans to develop applications;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An application built on that framework with an interface designed for
non-programmers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ways of customising the behaviour of the application by providing
some basic Python functions or more elaborated code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges was to offer an application with an easy to use
interface, not graphical, not web-based and not requiring Python
programming. This interface was necessary for batch processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk addresses how this project was carried out, the technical
solutions adopted and how Python was introduced in an operational
scientific institution (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ecmwf.int"&gt;http://www.ecmwf.int&lt;/a&gt;) where most users were
Fortran programmers. Python was introduced as early as 2004 and it was a
challenge to gain acceptance. I will also make a parallel with a project
I am currently working on for NASA (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/"&gt;http://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;em&gt;Desperately trying to forget technical details&lt;/em&gt; summarises how I tried,
using Python, to help Meteorology scientists to focus on their domain of
expertise instead of constantly solving technical problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="background"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Background:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciplines of Meteorology and Climate involve numerical modelling
of physical phenomena. The amount of data going in and out of the model
is considerable. The organisation and the storage of data is
complicated, their post-processing is a challenge. Scientists need to
access and process input and output data to monitor the trends of the
input data and to evaluate the performance of their models. Those
statistics, diagnostics, plots and verifications are crucial to the
improvement of the quality of the models. Finding the right data,
decoding it, transforming it to be ready for use are necessary steps to
initiate the pre-processing. All these actions are fundamentally the
same between different prediction centres, but the data organisation and
file formats can differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is an accepted high-level scripting language with a growing
community in academia and industry. It is used in a lot of scientific
applications in many different scientific fields and in more and more
industries, for example, in engineering or life science). In all fields,
the use of Python for high- performance and parallel computing is
increasing. Several organizations and companies are providing tools or
support for Python development. This includes libraries for scientific
computing, parallel computing, and MPI. Python is also used on many core
architectures and GPUs, for which specific Python interpreters are being
developed. A related topic is the performance of the various interpreter
and compiler implementations for Python. The talk gives an overview of
Python’s use in HPC and Scientific Computing and gives information on
many topics, such as Python on massively parallel systems, GPU
programming with Python, scientific libraries in Python, and Python
interpreter performance issues. The talk will include examples for
scientific codes and applications from many domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Roy Hyunjin Han&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Andreas Klöckner's PyCUDA, you can harness the massively parallel
supercomputing power of your NVIDIA graphics card to crunch numerically
intensive scientific computing applications in a fraction of the runtime
it would take on a CPU and at a fraction of the development cost of C++.
We'll cover hardware architecture, API fundamentals and several examples
to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two approaches to parallelizing a computationally heavy
procedure: use a messaging queue such as AMQP to distribute tasks among
a networked cluster or increase the number of processors in a single
machine. This talk focuses on techniques for adapting mathematical code
to run on specialized multi-core graphic processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern graphic processors have hard-coded transistors for common vector
and matrix operations, making them ideal for general scientific
computing. However, the NVIDIA CUDA's unique design requires knowledge
of its hardware to adapt algorithms effectively. This talk covers basic
CUDA architecture, API functions and several examples to illustrate the
different kinds of problems that will benefit from parallelization.&lt;/p&gt;
