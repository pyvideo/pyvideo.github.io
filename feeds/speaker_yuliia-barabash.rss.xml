alternative for search and analytics needs. When coupled with Python's
flexibility and the efficiency of serverless architecture, it transforms
into a dynamic trio that empowers developers to create efficient and
modern search applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us on a journey as we explore the synergy between OpenSearch,
Python, and serverless architecture. In this talk, we'll provide an
overview of OpenSearch and demonstrate how to utilize Python with
serverless architecture to power your search engine. Additionally, we
will delve into best practices and challenges that arise when employing
this combination in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this talk, you'll gain a clear understanding of how to
architect, build, and deploy efficient search applications using
OpenSearch, Python, and serverless architecture. Whether you're a
developer aiming to enhance your search capabilities or an architect
exploring modern search solutions, this talk will equip you with the
tools and insights needed to embrace this exciting synergy.&lt;/p&gt;
