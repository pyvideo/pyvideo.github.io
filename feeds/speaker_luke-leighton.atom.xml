&lt;p&gt;The Libre-SOC Project aims to bring to market a mass-volume System-on-a-Chip suitable for use in smartphones netbooks tablets and chromebooks, which is end-user programmable right to the bedrock. No spying backdoors, no treacherous DRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python and standard Libre Project Management is used throughout:
* nmigen, a python-based HDL, is a fundamental and critical strategic choice in creating the hardware.
* An IEEE754 FP hardware library has been developed using nmigen/python, as are hundreds of thousands of unit tests
* An OpenPOWER ISA simulator is written in python, and is actually a PLY compiler based on the GardenSnake example
* Several thousand unit tests for the HDL and simulator are written in python
* coriolis2, the VLSI ASIC layout toolchain, is a mixed c++ python application
* cocotb, a hardware co-simulation system, is used to verify the HDL is correct, down to the gate level
* a JTAG &amp;quot;remote&amp;quot; system has been written in python which allows the simulated processor to be connected to with openocd.
* Even the Standard Cell Library being used, called FlexLib, by Chips4Makers, is in python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say that python is critical to the project would be a massive understatement.  This talk will give a brief overview of the above areas and give a glimpse into why python was chosen for each.&lt;/p&gt;
