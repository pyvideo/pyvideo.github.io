&lt;p&gt;Networks in your infrastructure set the foundation for how your application can be deployed, maintained, and serviced. Python is the ideal language for network engineers to explore tools that were previously available to systems engineers and application developers. In this talk, we'll embark on a Python-based journey to transition from traditional network engineers to network developers ready for the next-generation of networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code examples, further recourses, and latest trends will be provided for audience with different level of needs depends on the scope of their network.&lt;/p&gt;
