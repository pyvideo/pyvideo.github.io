Markus Törnqvist - Plug in with Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are plugins? Why are they nice? How do you write them for applications? How do you make your application accept plugins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author: Python for about 15 years, since version 1.5 at school. Started coding Python for the web making his own frameworks before they were a thing. Since then a Django veteran who likes to take breaks writing Python in other ways, like Ripwhine the CD ripping tool. Original roots in system administration, then onto coding, being CTO at his startup for some years and currently Software Architect at Codento. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://fi.linkedin.com/in/mjtorn"&gt;https://fi.linkedin.com/in/mjtorn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From there it's on to
show an overview of the philosophy of plugins and different ways they're
used in different types of applications, what kinds of peculiarities
there are. I will top it off with some live coding!&lt;/p&gt;
