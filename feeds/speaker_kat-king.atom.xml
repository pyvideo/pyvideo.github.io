is any good? What does “good” mean, anyway? Well, you’re not alone - but
the good news is, there’s a way to find out! The secret lies in caring
about your developers and actively working to learn how your docs serve
them (or don’t!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll share the story of Twilio’s journey toward
empathy-driven documentation. By leveraging direct user feedback, user
experience research, and constantly testing the effectiveness of the
docs you provide, you can learn how your users work with (and wish they
could work with) your docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way I’ll share a few tips about what worked well for us, what
ideas didn’t pan out, and some of the documentation principles we’re now
sold on.&lt;/p&gt;
