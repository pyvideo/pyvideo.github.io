be scaled up almost trivially using Spark. For instance, we'll see

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apache Spark is becoming the new lingua franca for distributed
computing. In this talk I'll show how many machine learning tasks can be
scaled up almost trivially using Spark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After introducing the Spark computational model I'll detail some useful
design principles for running Spark programs on large datasets. I'll
also give some tips for effective configuration of a PySpark cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will include a step-by-step walk through of the scaling-up of
several NLP algorithms. For instance, we'll see how a semi-supervised
NLP algorithm can be trained on a billion training examples using a
PySpark cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

not what they seem. A/B test reports an uplift of 20% and yet this
increase never seems to translate into increased profits. So whatâ€™s
going on? I'll use python simulations to show that A/B testing is often
conducted in such a way that it virtually guarantees false positive
results. I'll also mention some python functions that can be used to
avoid these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
