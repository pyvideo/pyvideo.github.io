&lt;p&gt;What percentage of your users will spend? Typically, analysts use the conversion rate to assess how successful a website is at converting trial users into paying ones. But is this calculation giving us results that are lower than reality? With a talk rich in examples, Tristan will show how Shopify reframes the traditional conversion questions in survival analysis terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
What percentage of your users will spend? Typically, analysts use the conversion rate to assess how successful a website is at converting trial users into paying ones. But is this calculation giving us results that are lower than reality? With a talk rich in examples, Tristan will show how Shopify reframes the traditional conversion questions in survival analysis terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get started we will see examples of how skewed conversion rates can be when analyzing conversions that are delayed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, we will cover the basics of survival analysis (survival function, hazard function) and the kind of data it requires.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the lifelines python library, we will apply survival analysis to answer the limitations of conversion rates and gain insight about new merchants on Shopify.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a second case study, we will code to extend our toolbox outside of lifelines with the analysis of multiple outcomes (competing risks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
