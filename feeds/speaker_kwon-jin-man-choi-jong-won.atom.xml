In the server part, we talk about the hardships we experienced when migrating Wanted's actual service from Flask to FastAPI. We introduce three major difficulties we experienced when applying FastAPI, which has not yet been released as a major version, to the production level, and talk about how we solved those difficulties. We also briefly introduce our plans to use FastAPI better in the future. In the data engineering part, we introduce representative cases that can clearly show how Wanted Lab's data team independently solves problems in the life cycle from product development to distribution. Wanted Lab's data environment enables flexible collaboration with other teams through responsibility separation and environment separation. We introduce the method of how we built this independent data environment, and talk about how we can further advance the data team in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
