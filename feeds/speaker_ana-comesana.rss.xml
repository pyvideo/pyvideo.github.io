The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from all types of organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development. SciPy is organized by NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes open source scientific computing.&lt;/p&gt;

We seek to accelerate the development of sustainable aviation fuels using an early-stage design tool with a data-driven approach. We developed our strategy using the Python-based optimization packages BoTorch and Ax, and also rely on Pandas. We will discuss how to down-select from many possible fuel components to a specified number of chemical species and identify which combinations are most promising for a novel sustainable aviation fuel. We will also present its integration in our open-source web tool supporting biofuel research.&lt;/p&gt;
