conventional methods to detect outliers do not work effectively. I shall
discuss the application of two open source libraries in Python to build
an application that can reveal the presence of outliers in the
high-dimensional noisy data from ASML sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical outlier mining depends on identifying a contrast between
inliers and outliers. As the dimensionality of data increases, this
contrast starts to decrease owing to what is known as the curse of
dimensionality, and the data points start to become equidistant. A way
to prevent this is to use dimensionality reduction techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we build an application to detect outliers in the noisy data
collected by ASML sensors using open source Python packages. We first
use a neighbor graph based algorithm, to embed the high dimensional data
into low (2-3) dimensions, to aid in easy visualization. This is
followed by clustering the embedded data to reveal the distinct types of
outliers. All this is achieved in a completely unsupervised way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application provides valuable clues to an expert user trying to
decipher the sanity of data. A correlation of the physical pattern of
the detected outliers with location/time-stamp of the measurements helps
in the determination of the reason behind the failed measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
