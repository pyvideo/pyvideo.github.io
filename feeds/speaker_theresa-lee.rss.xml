Can you explain the following?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does &lt;cite&gt;a is b&lt;/cite&gt; evaluate to &lt;cite&gt;True&lt;/cite&gt; when both variables have a value of 201? Why does the statement evaluate to` False` if they both have a value of 498?
When will Python still hold a reference to an object that has been deleted?
How does Python collect garbage and is it any different from other languages like Ruby?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn the answers to these questions and better understand concepts like interning, reference counting, reference cycles, and generational garbage collection in this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
