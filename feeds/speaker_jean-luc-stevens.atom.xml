You'll learn how to use Panel to lay out your existing plots with widgets to make apps in the notebook or as deployed dashboards, hvPlot to make your Pandas or Xarray .plot() API calls return interactive, explorable plots, HoloViews and GeoViews to help you explore multidimensional data naturally without having to build a plot for each combination or sample of the data space, and Datashader to visualize even the very largest datasets faithfully in a web browser.

You'll start by using the HoloViews library to annotate your numpy, pandas, or xarray data and make it have an instantly available visual representation. These declarative objects make it easy to visualize how different sets of data relate to each other, by flexibly overlaying and laying out data in any combination. Once you have these objects, you can select, slice, or sample your data as needed, quickly making new types of plots so that you can fully understand your data. You'll be able to choose between Matplotlib plots suitable for publications, or Bokeh plots that support interactive exploration in Jupyter Notebooks or as separate dashboard apps. You'll then see how to use HoloViews and related tools to transform your data for viewing in different ways, defining complex analysis pipelines if needed that preserve the raw data while making each step visible for analysis. When your datasets are too large for web browsers, we'll show how to use Datashader to reveal &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the data faithfully, rendering it into an image that can be displayed safely even for billions of datapoints. When it is time to share your results with non-developer colleagues, we'll show how to use Param to add interactive widgets to let them explore parameter spaces, how to link plots to respond to user selections and events, and how to put plots and widgets together into a separately launchable dashboard. Throughout, we will demonstrate how to customize plots as needed, how to follow up on specific topics to get more information, and how and when to use each of the libraries described. The aim is to give users the tools and know-how to effectively explore, analyze and visualize even large and complex datasets easily, concisely, and reproducibly. You can see a detailed breakdown of the topics included, including the full training materials as Jupyter notebooks, at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pyviz.github.io/pyviz/tutorial/00_Welcome.html"&gt;https://pyviz.github.io/pyviz/tutorial/00_Welcome.html&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualization represents a major bottleneck in scientific research, engineering, data science, and data analytics. The tools in the Python scientific ecosystem make it very simple to do many of the tasks required, but building visualizations to help understand complex patterns and relationships in your data still typically involves a large amount of custom coding for every new type of plot. Writing long and detailed scripts for plotting slows down the process of exploration and reporting, while the difficulty involved means that many important observations and discoveries are missed due to inadequate visualizations. The complexity of the resulting plotting code makes it difficult to rapidly build sophisticated, interactive visualizations that can quickly reveal the underlying structure of the data, and once such complex plotting scripts have been created they can be a major impediment to future understanding, reproduction, and modification of the research process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you will learn how to approach the problem of interactive visualization declaratively. Using the HoloViews library, you can annotate your data and store it in general-purpose containers that will be instantly visualizable. The declarative objects in HoloViews wrap your data to make it incredibly easy to visualize how different sets of data relate to each other, using subfigures, animations, interactive widgets and custom interactions. This flexibility has made HoloViews the chosen future replacement for the high-level Bokeh Charts API and works particularly well with IPython/Jupyter notebooks, where you can immediately see the output from selecting, combining, slicing, or sampling these objects. Each of these operations generates a different type of visualization, that can be flexibly extended even to complex dashboards deployed using the Bokeh server or Jupyter dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core design principle of HoloViews is to make it simple to create complex plot layouts and interactivity by applying compositional operations to a small number of elements and containers. Since HoloViews separates the declaration of the data from the precise visual details of the plotting code, the same HoloViews objects can be rendered using matplotlib for publication-quality plots, or bokeh for interactive use. Overall, this means the user can focus on &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; to plot before worrying about &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; exactly it should be displayed, providing a huge boost in productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
