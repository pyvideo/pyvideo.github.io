documentation and the entire (then draft) Django Book. Over the next few
years I became a frequent contributor to Django, including becoming a
core developer and later a member of the DSF board. Now I'm largely
uninvolved with Django's development. This talk is the story of my time
with Django. This talk is a walk through my time with Django -- from
emailing Adrian to ask about attending a sprint that had already
happened, to contributing patches, to the multi-db GSOC, to Eric
Florenzano's keynote, becoming a core developer, joining the board, to
slowly fading away and becoming an emeritus developer.&lt;/p&gt;

You'll leave this talk with some concrete things you can do to make your
next meetup, workshop, or conference more inclusive of people with
disabilities, including how to advertise your accommodations, what to
look for in a venue, and some free tools to help your website be more
accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

what was once a US Post Office in downtown Lawrence. After all, as I
hope to show, our lovely #LFK has a history of influencing the wider
world.&lt;/p&gt;

civic tech to make government more accountable and transparent. From a
single Drupal site, to an organization powered by Django, we’ll tell the
story of how a Python web framework built a successful nonprofit. The
history of our open source Django apps tell the story of a growing
organization and an open government movement. We'll cover various Django
apps we have published and how each reflected the state of our
organization, the open government community, or Django at the time they
were created.&lt;/p&gt;

public, there are still unanswered questions. Why did one of the
original authors flee the country? What happened to all the removed
magic? And, more importantly, why are there secret messages hidden in
the template parser's regular expressions? I'll be attempting to throw
light on some of the dark secrets of Django and, perhaps, finally divine
its true purpose, after almost a decade of searching.&lt;/p&gt;

as it has grown over the years. As a primary person involved with Read
the Docs, and Write the Docs, I have seen a lot of angles, and
appreciate documentation more every year. I believe better documentation
is a fundamental aspect of how we can improve programming culture, and
an often misunderstood part of outreach and education. Read the Docs
started in Lawrence, and has grown from there. This seems like the
perfect venue to wax poetic about why documentation matters, and tell
the story of Read the Docs along the way. The Django community is one
where documentation has always been valued, and I think that
understanding how it lead to its success and why it's an important
virtue going forward is important. This talk will make you think more
deeply about the social impact of documentation, and hopefully make you
question if it should be a higher priority in your development.&lt;/p&gt;

there is for a self-employed developer: I was burned out. The blinking
cursor in Vim was taunting me and no number of GitHub issues could
motivate me to churn out more than a few lines of code in a day. This
burnout, though, led me back to an early love: I started teaching full
time.This is a talk in two parts. In part one, I’ll talk about some of
the teaching triumphs I’ve had and witnessed thanks to a new career, the
Python and Django worlds, and my employer, Treehouse (and others!). In
the second part, I’ll share ways you can start teaching in your own
communities and using your own talents, so we can all make the world
better through learning.&lt;/p&gt;

in love with programming. Ola will share with you how she went from not
knowing anything about teaching programming or feminism, to knowing a
little bit more thanks to thousands of people who participated in the
workshop formula Django Girls created. You'll learn the secrets of
explaining the Internet, servers or Django ORM to people who never done
this before. And how to find 100+ women who want to learn to code just
