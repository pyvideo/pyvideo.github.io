authorities, legal pressures on businesses to have appropriate
compliance systems in place, and the constant pressure on their law
firms to commoditise compliance services, Pandas may be about to make a
foray from its venerable financial origins into a brave new fiscal world
- and can revolutionise an industry by doing so. A case study covering
the author's development of a Pandas-based stamp duty land tax engine
(&amp;quot;ORVILLE&amp;quot;) is discussed, and the inherent usefulness of Pandas in the
world of tax analysis is explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers are not famed for their mathematical ability. On the contary -
the law almost self-selects as a career choice for the
numerically-challenged. So when the one UK tax that property lawyers
generally felt comfortable dealing with (lease duty) was replaced with a
new tax (stamp duty land tax) that was both arithmetically demanding and
conceptually complex, it was inevitable that significant frustrations
would arise. Suddenly, lawyers had to deal with concepts such as net
present valuations, aggregation of several streams of fluctuating
figures, and constant integration of a complex suite of credits and
disregards. This talk is a description of how - against a backdrop of
data-drunk tax authorities, legal pressures on businesses to have
appropriate compliance systems in place, and the constant pressure on
their law firms to commoditise compliance services, Pandas may be about
to make a foray from its venerable financial origins into a brave new
fiscal world - and can revolutionise an industry by doing so. A case
