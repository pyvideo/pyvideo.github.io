Systems and Applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented by Ivan Beschastnikh, Justin Samuel, and Justin Cappos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seattle is an open-source platform for developing and deploying
networked applications. Core feature of Seattle is that it allows safe
execution of untrusted code on end-user systems. In our talk we look at
how we used Python to build a safe, restricted code execution
environment for Seattle that not only provides execution safety but also
enforces strict resource consumption limits. In addition, Seattle
includes a high-level API to hide inconsistent OS-specific behaviors
from developers. What results is a platform that welcomes the
participation of end-user machines for general-purpose distributed
programming and creates new possibilities for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
