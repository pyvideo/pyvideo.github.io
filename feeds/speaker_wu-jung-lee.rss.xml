These data provide opportunities to study the marine ecosystems at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. However, to date, these data remain significantly under-utilized, mainly due to the lack of data interoperability and scalable analysis workflow. We address these challenges by developing an open-source Python package, echopype, which defines an interoperable netCDF file format and leverages the power of Xarray and Dask for explicit and efficient sonar data analysis in the Jupyter environment.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the broad usage of these data has been hindered by the lack of modular software tools that allow flexible composition of data processing workflows that incorporate powerful analytical tools in the scientific Python ecosystem. We address this gap by developing Echostack, a suite of open-source Python software packages that leverage existing distributed computing and cloud-interfacing libraries to support intuitive and scalable data access, processing, and interpretation. These tools can be used individually or orchestrated together, which we demonstrate in example use cases for a fisheries acoustic-trawl survey.&lt;/p&gt;
