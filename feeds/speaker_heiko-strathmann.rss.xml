Learning, which is the art of finding structure in data, with
applications in object recognition, brain-computer interfaces, robotics,
stock-prices prediction, etc. We give a gentle introduction to ML and
Shogun's Python interface, focussing on intuition and visualisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present the Shogun Machine Learning Toolbox, a unified framework for
Machine Learning algorithms. Machine Learning (ML) is the art of finding
structure in data in an automated way and has given rise to a wide range
of applications such as recommendation systems, object recognition,
brain-computer interfaces, robotics, predicting stock prices, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our toolbox offers extensive bindings with other software and computing
languages, Python being the major target. The library was initiated in
1999 and remained under heavy development henceforth. In addition to its
mature core-framework, Shogun offers state-of-the-art techniques based
on latest ML research. This is partly made possible by the 21 Google
Summer of Code projects (5+8+8 since 2011) that our students
successfully completed. Shogun's codebase has &amp;gt;20k commits made by &amp;gt;100
contributors representing &amp;gt;500k lines of code. While its core is written
in C++, a unique of technique for generating interfaces allows usage
from a wide range of target languages -- under the same syntax. This
includes in particular Python, but also Matlab/Octave, Java, C#, R,
ruby, and more. We believe that users should be able to choose their
favourite language rather than us dictating this choice. The same
applies for supported OS (Linux, Mac, Win). Shogun is part of Debian
Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features of Shogun include most classical ML methods such as
classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, etc,
most of them in different flavours. All implemented algorithms in Shogun
work on a modular data representation, which allows to easily switch
between different sorts of objects as for example strings or matrices.
Common ML-tasks and data IO can be carried under a unified interface.
This is also true for the various external open-source libraries that
are embedded within Shogun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code examples are provided for all implemented algorithms. The main and
most complete set of examples is in the Python language. In addition, in
order to push usage of Shogun in education at universities, we recently
started adding more illustrative IPython notebooks. A growing list of
statically rendered versions are readily available from our
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/notebook"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;
and implement a cross-over of tutorial-style explanations, code, and
visualization examples. We even took this up a notch and started
building our own IPython-notebook server with Shogun installed in the
cloud at (try cloud button in notebook view) . This allows users to try
Shogun without installation via the IPython notebook web interface. All
example notebooks can be loaded, interactively modified, and executed.
In addition, using the Python Django framework, we built a collection of
interactive web-demos where users can play around with basic ML
algorithms,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/page/documentation/demo"&gt;demos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the proposed talk, we will give a gentle and general introduction to
ML and the core functionality of Shogun, with a focus on its Python
interface. This includes solving basic ML tasks such as classification
and regression and some of the more recent features, such as last year's
GSoC projects and their IPython notebook writeups. ML material will be
presented with a focus on intuition and visualisation and no previous
familiarity with ML methods is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Key points in the talk&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the goals in ML?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example problems in ML (classification, regression, clustering)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some basic algorithm ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on Visualisation, not Maths&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="intended-audience"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Intended Audience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All people dealing with data (data scientists, big-data hackers) who
are looking for tools to deal with it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with a general interest but no education in Machine Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People interested in the technology behind Shogun (swig, cloud
notebook server, web-demos)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People from the ML community (scipy-stack)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ML scientists/Statisticians&lt;/li&gt;
