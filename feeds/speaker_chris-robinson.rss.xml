Aimed at beginners, this talk will explore the work I am currently doing at Aberfoyle Park High School; enabling beginner students with no programming experience to learn the basics of the Python language, create their own games and apps using only their iPads and reaching the end goal of publishing their creations to the App Store. This content would be suitable for Year 6 students and above.&lt;/p&gt;
