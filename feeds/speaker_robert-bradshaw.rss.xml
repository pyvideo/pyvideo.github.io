In this talk, we present Apache Beam--a parallel programming model that allows one to implement batch and streaming data processing jobs that can run on a variety of scalable execution engines like Spark and Dataflow--and its new Python SDK. We discuss some of the interesting challenges in providing a Pythonic API and execution environment for distributed processing, and show how Beam allows the user to write a Python pipeline once that can run in both batch and streaming mode. We walk through a few examples of data processing pipelines in Beam for use cases such as real time data analytics and feature engineering with Tensorflow for machine learning pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Bradshaw is a software engineer at Google, working on tools for doing petabyte-scale data processing. He is also active in the open source community, leading the Cython project since it's inception and as a long-time contributor to the open source mathematics software Sage. He received a B.S. in Mathematics and Linguistics from Brigham Young University and a Ph.D. in Mathematics from University of Washington with William Stein studying questions related to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Robert currently resides in Seattle, Washington with his wife Camille and their two sets of young twins.&lt;/p&gt;
