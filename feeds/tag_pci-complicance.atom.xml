or you plan on accepting them in the future, then you will need to worry
about PCI DSS. Learn what you need to do to make sure that your
application is PCI DSS compliant, and if it is not, what you need to do
to bring it into compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCI DSS is a set of twelve different security standards that are
required for any organization that handles credit or debit card
transactions. These standards are created by the Payment Card Industry
Security Standards Council and they require all organizations to
validate that they are compliant every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these rules and how they effect you is sometimes a
daunting task. The goals of this talk will be the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain PCI DSS, and quickly go over the rules that will effect your
application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show how to securely handle credit card transactions in your Django
application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storing credit card information isn't ideal, but if you need to, I'll
explain the different ways to securely store the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go over the different ways to limit your PCI DSS liability
(BrianTree, Akamai Edge Tokenization, Auth.net CIM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore the different tools you will need in order validate your PCI
compliance (Web application scans, IDS, Network Scan, firewalls)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to be PCI Complaint in the cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll close out the talk with some of the details on how I haver
personally satisfied PCI DSS Requirements on my projects in the past.
I'll cover some of the tools and services that I used, and why I decided
to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the talk you should have a better understanding of
PCI DSS, and what you need to do, in order for your Django application
to be certified as compliant.&lt;/p&gt;
