In this talk we'll explore why it exists, how it works, and what the heck it's doing in your stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great web framework abstracts away all the low-level stuff so that you can focus on the core functionality of your application. This is helpful for getting you going quickly but can be a source of frustration when you want to start optimizing your application. In the Law of Leaky Abstractions Joel Spolsky makes the case that abstracting away the low-level stuff prevents us from learning important concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's learn about WSGI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WSGI is the Web Server Gateway Interface and it's the foundation of almost every Python web framework. This isn't going to be a talk that you'll walk out of with immediate tips for tuning your web service (don't worry, Graham Dumpleton has that covered). Instead, you'll develop an appreciation for the low-level goings on of your stack every time you handle a request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is intended primarily for Python web developers, but should be approachable for anyone with an intermediate experience of Python. I look forward to talking to you!&lt;/p&gt;
