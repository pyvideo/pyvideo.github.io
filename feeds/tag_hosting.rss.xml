Fabric, and other modern tools. It made a short appearance in a
lightning talk and at the sprints during EP 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk gives an overview and demonstrates with practical examples how
we deploy web applications with many complex components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modelling service components with Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multiple environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multiple platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;development environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;convergent behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remote deployments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;secrets management (database passwords, SSL certificates, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no additional run-time dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show how the real-life requirements in our projects led us to
develop a general model that integrates existing practices without
building a huge stack of technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year there's a been a whole new crop of specialized
hosting platforms for Django applications. In this panel, we speak to a
number of the people behind these new platforms to discuss what benefits
they offer, what challenges they face, and what the Django
project/community can do to encourage their growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenStack is an innovative open source project written in Python, backed
by Rackspace Hosting and NASA, building a massively-scalable and
reliable cloud computing platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of this talk will clarify the place of OpenStack in the
general &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot; landscape and explain why a fully open cloud
infrastructure stack is necessary to avoid vendor lock-in. We'll then
focus on the OpenStack project goals, its developer community, its open
design and release processes, and the developer tools it chose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the talk will present into more technical details the
different components of OpenStack: Nova (compute) and Swift (storage),
including the Python libraries that are used (libvirt, SQLAlchemy,
eventlet…). A Q&amp;amp;A session at the end of the talk will give the audience
a chance to clear any remaining dark area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google App Engine is a unique hosting platform that lets you build
applications and run them in Google's data centers using the massive
global infrastructure built to run the Internet's most powerful company.
App Engine offers a development environment that uses familiar
technologies (Java and Python) and provides a powerful and robust set of
APIs to users while maintaining security and independence from other
apps running in the cloud. It is always free to get started so you can
try it out with no risk, and if you need additional computing resources,
you can purchase additional computing resources beyond the free quota
limits. (If you enable billing and trust us with your credit card, we
will extend your free quotas even further; you won't get charged until
you exceed those &lt;em&gt;extended&lt;/em&gt; quotas.) Scale your application to millions
of users and pay only for what you use at competitive market pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we provide an update of the newest features found in
the most recent releases of the App Engine platform. We also share some
suggestions for best practices to existing App Engine developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginners to the App Engine platform will be interested in the
introductory workshop which may be offered (see description below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google App Engine workshop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we'll give you a comprehensive introduction to the
platform in two/three components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-hour Introduction to Cloud computing and Google App Engine seminar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-hour App Engine hands-on workshop/codelab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first hour, we review Cloud Computing as an industry and where
Google App Engine fits into the picture. Specifically, we discuss App
Engine as a PaaS solution because of the inherent challenges of building
web and other applications. We'll outline the architecture of App
Engine, what it's major components are, introduce its features and APIs,
discuss the service and how it works (including information on the free
quotas), present some information about current users and usage,
including integration with Google Apps, and finally, give an overview of
its enterprise edition called Google App Engine for Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the approximately one-hour lecture, we'll show you how to create
applications that run on App Engine by building a simple but real web
application from the ground up via a hands-on coding laboratory.
Although based on the online tutorial, this codelab goes up and beyond
what's in the documentation: you will get a more detailed step-by-step
instructions to replicate that example as well as have the opportunity
to extend your application with some of the newer APIs that come with
App Engine. The codelab will cover the Users service, non-relational
Datastore, and Memcache APIs. Time-permitting, we'll also discuss some
of the newest features found in recent App Engine releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At ep.io we built a Python hosting platform from the ground up, designed
to run large numbers of web applications on a small number of physical
machines both securely and in a reasonably scalable way. This talk will
show you how we built our infrastructure - using Redis, eventlet,
PostgreSQL and more - and what lessons we learnt from our first few
thousand deploys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how we split services into multiple processes and greenthreads; the
pains of building a cooperatively-multitasking PTY module; how Redis
isn't the answer to everything, but is still very useful; how to
persuade third-party software to work securely in a shared environment;
and how important it is to have good logging, especially when you have
more than five servers.&lt;/p&gt;

Lasagne&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;XMPP is an open technology for real-time communication. Although
primarily known for its application in the IM service &amp;quot;Jabber&amp;quot; (and,
subsequently, gchat/gtalk), it has numerous applications and creates new
opportunities for inter-system communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While researching for an alternative to webservices at Mendix, we came
across XMPP and realized it solved many of the shortcomings of
webservices. It is currently being used to handle all inter-system and
inter-process communication in the Mendix cloud hosting environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will give a general overview of what XMPP is, an introduction
to the sleekxmpp python library and how the core features of xmpp can
help an architecture scale well horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Required knowledge: basic understanding of hosting environments.&lt;/p&gt;

have&amp;amp;nbsp_place_holder;become a crucial part of the Internet
landscape, with Python becoming an increasingly popular choice for the
implementation of all manner of web applications. In order though for
users to be able to access your web application you need to host it. The
choices available are however many and varied with accurate information
on which may be a good choice not always easy to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brandon Craig Rhodes (Rhodes Mill Studios, Inc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of WebFaction has been dramatic in the world of Python-friendly
hosting services. What are the secrets to getting the most out of their
features? From the point of view of a customer with no other affiliation
with WebFaction â€” as a customer advising other customers â€” this talk
offers lessons learned in using WebFaction to host everything from lone
static content to multiple Python web applications and services
co-existing together. WebFaction uses some unique techniques to support
both user-local &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; application-local Python packages. Should you use
their special installation techniques, or install and use virtualenv on
your own initiative? Learn the trade-offs, and learn how &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to get
yourself in trouble while running &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;easy_install&lt;/tt&gt; on WebFaction, my
favorite hosting service.&lt;/p&gt;
