There
are tools and algorithms mature enough to add value in almost any
industry and you do not need a Math Ph.D to learn Deep Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will briefly paint a picture of the exciting world of
Deep Learning and then explain Deep Learning concepts using
Convolutional Neural Networks as a base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part will be a live demo of a Convolutional Neural Network
written in Python doing image classification.&lt;/p&gt;
