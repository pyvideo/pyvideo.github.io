Building and serving
individual machine learning models for thousands of customers every
single day is harder. Model training time must be kept to a minimum,
memory constraints are exacerbated and the love and insight that one
would usually apply to refining a single model must be automated and
scaled. At Zendesk we successfully use pandas, scikit-learn, flask and
hadoop to run a machine learning ecosystem that builds, tunes and serves
account specific models via an API for many of our customers. This talk
is about what we learnt building it and how Python's data stack let us
get it to production really really fast.&lt;/p&gt;
