&lt;p&gt;Thursday 2:45 p.m.--3:30 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience level: Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION This talk will introduce both Class-based Views (CBV) and
Class-based Generic Views (CBGV), before moving into how to customize
CBGV, focusing in particular on data generation at the view and form
level. The talk will further involve the source code for CBGV,
Validation, and Python's Method Resolution Order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT When tasked with building a Banking website, I set out to build
the the site using Class-based Generic View (CBGV). As I built the
features, I quickly discovered that assumptions I had made about
Validation and CBGV were wrong, circumventing data generation and
propagation in the banking app. In this talk, I will detail the
solutions I came up with to the various problems I encountered while
building the site. As such, this talk is an in-depth look at CBGV, that
will involve a short tutorial in both Class-based Views (CBV) and CBGV.
We will then examine the source code of CBGV, allowing for customization
of the project's views. Notably, these customizations allow for data
generation in Forms and Views, instead of Models. This talk will also
offer a short analysis of Validation, and quickly look at Python's
Method Resolution Order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the talk, you will have a fundamental understanding of
both CBV and CBGV, and you will know which functions to override in
Models, Forms, and Views to automatically generate data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to make views and HTTP as clear as daylight.
This talk is for you if you're confused about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how function views compare to class-based views when to use generic
class-based views- the difference between class-based views and generic
class-based views- or when to use any of these This talk will start with
an introduction to HTTP and how Django handles HTTP. We will then look
at each kind of view in Django, focusing on how each works and why
Django implements it that way. This will allow us to look at the
advantages and shortcomings of each type of view. Finally, with a full
understanding of Django views, we will be able to easily determine when
to use each type of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table of Contents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is HTTP, anyway? Django's HTTP Request/Response Cycle What is a
callable? History of View Functions Functions Generics Classes and
Generics View Functions (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love
Non-Compliance) Class Based Views (or As DRY as the Sahara) Generic
Class Based Views (or Oh For The Love of Graph Theory) Enhancing Views
(or 1-Size fits no-one) Fixing Your Views When to Use What&lt;/p&gt;
