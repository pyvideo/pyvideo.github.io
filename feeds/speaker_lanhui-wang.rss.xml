combine models developed by multiple analysts for distinct subsets of
a large feature space. We apply the framework to retail sales data,
but its design can accommodate other types of target variables. This
is a novel application of ensemble learning since it addresses both
analytical and organizational challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
