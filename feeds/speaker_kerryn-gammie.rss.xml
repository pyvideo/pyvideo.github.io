something more accessible for business-users to engage with is tricky.
While this speaks to a larger problem of upskilling and making education
more accessible, one method of translation is through story telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learn best when an &lt;strong&gt;idea is relatable, simple, and colourful&lt;/strong&gt;. This
talk is going to look at how to convey complex ideas simply. I'm going
to be covering two sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That's So Random (Forests)!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You Gotta (Neural) Network to Get Work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll run through the high level concepts and methodologies, and then
show the work/code that was done to create a random forest, and a neural
network. Note: this will cover how I built the RF, and NN using Python
via Jupyter Notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session is for anyone who uses/wants to use ML to solve problems
but struggles with translating the black-box-magic. It's going to be an
engaging, and slightly animated, talk with the intention of reinforcing
concepts and showcasing different ways of explaining them.&lt;/p&gt;
