This talk will take you through our adventurous journey in rewriting a monolithic Waartaa into several microservices and how we implemented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inter process communication
Keeping services as stateless as possible
Single source of truth
Realtime publishers
The end result of this venture is ircb, a scalable IRB bouncer for humans, written using Python 3 asyncio, and on top of homebrewed zeromq based store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will be organized as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the scene
Why move to microservices?
Managing state in microservices can be a nightmare?
Server side Flux to the rescue
Walk through IRCB architecture
Demo - concepts in action
Future
Questions&lt;/p&gt;
