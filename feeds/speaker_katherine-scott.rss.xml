The process starts with a flask application to label your data, followed by characterizing, training, and evaluating the CNN using Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks, and Bokeh plots. Finally we show how the CNN can be deployed and used in real-world applications.

Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks: they’re new, they’re big, they’re complex, they’re poorly documented and accordingly they are a little scary. At Planet we will image the entire earth every day, and to deliver that data to customers we need to analyze images without it ever being seen by human eyes. In this talk we’ll cover how to build, train, and characterize a neural net for image classification all from the comfort and safety of a Jupyter notebook. This talk will serve as a template for building and using your very own CNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bio
Katherine Scott is a senior software engineer at Planet working on image classification. Prior to planet Ms. Scott was the co-founder and CTO of Tempo Automation and a co-founder at Sight Machine.&lt;/p&gt;

The talk will cover finding, processing, evaluating and visualizing open satellite data using open source tools written in python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth imaging satellites, just like our computers, are shrinking and becoming more ubiquitous than ever before. It is now possible to obtain open satellite data on a daily if not weekly basis and for this data to be put to work; helping us better understand our planet and quickly respond to disaster situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will work through a jupyter notebook that covers the satellite data ecosystem and the python tools that can be used to sift through and analyze that data. Topics include python tools for using Open Street Maps data, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), and OpenCV and NumPy for image processing. This talk is intended for novice and intermediate python developers who are interested in using data science and satellite imagery for social good and fundamental scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

PyCon. In this talk we will discuss what computer vision is, why it's
useful, what tools exist in the Python ecosystem, and how to apply it to
your project. The talk will focus on the SimpleCV library but also touch
upon NumPy. SciPy and iPython notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;

archive for images of cats, or create a dart turret that follows your
face? This tutorial will show you how to do this and a whole lot more
with computer vision. The tutorial will be suitable for all levels of
developers and is a great way for python novice’s to explore the world
of computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;

the internet! In this talk we'll connect physical things and people to
the internet. In this talk we will live code a tiny web server that
interacts with the physical world via sensors, actuators, video, and
audio. We will explore tools in the Python ecosystem that make this
possible and show how they work together.&lt;/p&gt;

start. Turns out there is a python robotics framework, and it runs some
of the most sophisticated robots in the world! It is also open source,
well-documented, and has a great community. In this talk we will look at
Robot Operating System ROS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few of us would write our own web server from scratch using first principals. The python ecosystem has so many tools to make it fast and easy to create a fairly sophisticated web application. But what about if you want to build a robot? It turns out that one of the best robotics packages in the world has python hooks, and you can use it to do all sorts of awesome things. This talk will give a brief introduction to Robot Operating System and how to interface with it in python. In this talk we will cover the basics of ROS setup, package building, and robot software development. In particular we will look at how to interface with different bits of hardware, build up complex robot behaviors from that hardware, and then deploy the results.&lt;/p&gt;
