as important as it is stressful. What belongs in there? What constitutes
your &amp;quot;best work&amp;quot;? What if all your work is proprietary? Do you really
need a portfolio if you have a great job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a portfolio is an exercise in documenting yourself: your
writing, your skill, your journey as a professional. Like any other kind
of documentation, it isn't easy or intuitive to create something great.
And like any other kind of documentation, it's worth doing the hard work
to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why you need a portfolio even if you have a stable job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to create a well-rounded portfolio and decide what's your best
work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategies for adding proprietary work (legally!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options to present it that aren't just a series of email attachments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
