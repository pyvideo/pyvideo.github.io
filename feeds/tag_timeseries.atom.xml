successive intervals of time. Time series analysis is performed to
extract meaningful statistics and characteristics of the data. For
example, this analysis can be used to predict future based on the past
events. Such use cases of this analysis are stock market prediction,
weather prediction and web traffic prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll be understanding the basics and how to perform time
series analysis and machine learning for a given dataset. For this talk,
we’ll be using the UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Data Set to
classify a given activity performed by the human as one of the following
activities: Walking, Sitting, Standing or Laying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk would be intermediate level and basics of Python and Pandas are
required. Understanding of Machine Learning algorithms and signal
processing would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

of data that humans supposed to exceed in - images, video, sounds,
texts. They can not only predict something based on some input but also
generate new images or sounds. Meanwhile, we are forgetting about
another very important source of data - signals (or time series, which
will be interchangeably here), that gets less hype in public but
benefits a lot from applying deep learning comparing to classical
approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will review what are sources of time series and what
business goals are we solving while analyzing them, what are “old” tools
for analysis and how deep neural nets overcome them, we will learn the
latest trends and ruin some myths and, moreover, we will see how
generative models can be applied to the signal processing as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this talk, you’ll be able to boost your current solutions in
signal processing or time series analysis with deep learning. It will be
also interesting for practitioners in other areas, like computer vision
or NLP since we will discuss some concepts that are widely applicable.
Previous experience with time series is not required, but some
theoretical or practical experience with machine learning and/or neural
networks is preferred.&lt;/p&gt;
