&lt;p&gt;The development of web applications rarely ends with deploying the code to a host server, and some would say that’s when the real work actually begins. An application which works fine in a development environment could present a wide range of issues when running in the wild, some of which are easier to anticipate than others. The web application developer has many tools and techniques available to minimise the chance of failure and maximise the chance of fixing an issue quickly. This results in more robust deploys, happier customers, increased productivity and of course more developer sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
