The primary purpose of JOSS is to enable developers of research software to receive citation credit equivalent to typical archival publications. Rather than a review of a lengthy software paper (including, e.g., methodology, validation, sample results), JOSS submissions undergo rigorous peer review of both the abstract and software itself, including documentation, tests, continuous integration, and licensing. The JOSS review process is modeled on the established approach of the rOpenSci collaboration. The entire submission and review process occurs openly on GitHub; papers not yet accepted remain visible and under review until the authors make appropriate changes for acceptance---unlike other journals, papers requiring major revision are not rejected. Since its public release in May 2016, JOSS has published 87 papers as of March 2017, with an additional 38 currently under review.&lt;/p&gt;

We seek to accelerate the development of sustainable aviation fuels using an early-stage design tool with a data-driven approach. We developed our strategy using the Python-based optimization packages BoTorch and Ax, and also rely on Pandas. We will discuss how to down-select from many possible fuel components to a specified number of chemical species and identify which combinations are most promising for a novel sustainable aviation fuel. We will also present its integration in our open-source web tool supporting biofuel research.&lt;/p&gt;
