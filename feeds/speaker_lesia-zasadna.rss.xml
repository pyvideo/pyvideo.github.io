requirements it satisfies. Typical requirements revolve around target
audience, method of delivery, technical limitations. But after the doc
is done, then come unexpected expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, your docs should not only make users happy, but also help your
stakeholders achieve their aims - move up a career ladder, impress the
boss, get a bigger paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;
