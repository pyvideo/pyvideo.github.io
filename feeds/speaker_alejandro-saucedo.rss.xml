In this talk we demystify machine learning bias through a hands-on example. We'll be tasked to automate the loan approval process for a company, and introduce key tools and techniques from latest research that allow us to assess and mitigate undesired bias in our machine learning models.&lt;/p&gt;

the productization of machine learning systems, including concepts such
as reproducibility, explainability and orchestration. The talk will also
provide a high level overview of several key open source tools and
frameworks available to tackle these issues, which have been identifyed
putting together the Awesome Machine Learning Operations list
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-machine-learning-operations"&gt;https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-machine-learning-operations&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The key concepts that will be covered are:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Reproducibility&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Explainability&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Orchestration of models&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reproducibility piece will cover key motivations as well as
practical requirements for model versioning, together with tools that
allow data scientists to achieve version control of model+config+data to
ensure full model lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explainability piece will contain a high level overview of why this
has become an important topic in machine learning, including the high
profile incidents that tech companies have experienced where undesired
biases have slipped into data. This will also include a high level
overview of some of the tools available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the orchestration piece will cover some of the fundamental
challenges with large scale serving of models, together with some of the
key tools that are available to ensure this challenge can be tackled.&lt;/p&gt;

throughout my career building &amp;amp; deploying machine learning systems in
critical environments across several sectors. I will provide a deep dive
on how to build scalable and distributed machine learning data pipelines
using Airflow with a Celery backend. I will also compare Airflow with
other technologies available out there and how it differentiates, such
as Luigi, Chronos, Pinball, etc. If you attend the talk, you will obtain
an understanding on the solid fundamentals of Airflow, together with its
caveats and walk-arounds for more complex use-cases. As we proceed with
the examples, I will cover the challenges that you will run into when
scaling Machine Learning systems, and how Airflow can be used to address
these using a manager-worker-queue architecture for distributed
processing with Celery. By the end of this talk you will have the
knowledge required to build your own industry-ready machine learning
pipelines to process data at scale, and I will provide further reading
resources so people are able to implement the knowledge obtained almost
right away.&lt;/p&gt;
