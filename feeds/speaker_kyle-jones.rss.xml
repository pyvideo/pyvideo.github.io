&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will dive into the various resources required to develop and host modern software, some of the innovative ways in which large organisations like Microsoft are reducing their resource consumption, as well as the ways in which we can reduce our impact on the environment through architectural choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
