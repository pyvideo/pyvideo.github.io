and form, such as; architecture, geometry, material, and even energy,
which requires in thorough investigation and understanding of the
outcomes to discover optimum design solutions. However, without this
understanding, analysis and the overlay of interactive data seems
impossible and fanciful. Although it was not possible to analyse and use
data in traditional architecture, today it is getting real to do with
the large volumes of information such as, annual climatic data, sun
positions, environmental data, energy data etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is the most adaptable and robust program which we use to analyse,
overlay and optimise data in the field of architecture. We want to
understand how it works in a three-dimensional program such as Rhino and
how it can help us to develop our ideas and utilise the recent
architectural design methodology, which is known as parametric
architecture, or algorithmic architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will demonstrate 3 different experiences in the fields of; geometry,
energy, and optimization, and what the approach of each is. Python aids
the design of architectural elements through the relation of form to and
data simulations. This would be of interest to those who want to see the
future of algorithmic design for; architects, designers, and
programmers. There is no experience needed, we just want to express the
enjoyment these tools can add to three-dimensional design.&lt;/p&gt;
