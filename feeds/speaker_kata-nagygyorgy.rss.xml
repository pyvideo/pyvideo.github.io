and we're incredibly happy to see the wide diversity that it contains.
In the beginning of 2016 we put together a survey to investigate how
people are doing their jobs, what the current status is of
documentation, and what the future will bring. We're calling this effort
&amp;quot;Poll the Docs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the 100+ participants who already filled it out and shared
their experiences and thoughts about documentation. We will be able to
share insights about the demographic background of the community, how
documentarians usually start working in this field and give an overview
of the most supported practises, tools, languages and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
