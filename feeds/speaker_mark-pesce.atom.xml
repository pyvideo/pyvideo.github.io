&lt;p&gt;Presented by Mark Pesce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Mark Pesce does know Python, he doesn't consider himself any
sort of expert so he won't be talking about Python, except to whinge
that his friends pick on him for choosing a language which uses
whitespace as syntax. Try as he might, he can't get his friends to see
the logic of this - even though they always pretty-print their own code,
in whatever language they write. Go figure. So, Mark will not be talking
about that. What will Mark be talking about? Well, um, err... (sound of
shuffling papers) ...oh, yeah, here it is: 'Mark Pesce will be talking
about stuff. And things. And how great it all is. No, really. You'll
see. Promise.' ? Mark is best-known as the co-inventor of VRML, and as
panelist/judge on ABC's &amp;quot;The New Inventors&amp;quot;. The author of five books
and numerous articles, he has a monthly column in NETT magazine, is a
frequent contributor to ABC Unleashed, and is a sought-after commentator
on both radio and television. Since 2006, Pesce has held an Honorary
Appointment in the Digital Cultures Program at the University of Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
