But how do you do that without recreating all of your Django business logic in JavaScript?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the problem faced by Wagtail CMS (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wagtail.io/"&gt;https://wagtail.io/&lt;/a&gt;) when building a new version of StreamField, the framework for editing and organising structured page content. Our solution was a new library, 'telepath (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wagtail.github.io/telepath/"&gt;https://wagtail.github.io/telepath/&lt;/a&gt;)', which can be thought of as a cross-platform version of Python's pickle mechanism, allowing arbitrary object to be unpacked into JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll show how Wagtail has used telepath to enhance Django forms with new client-side capabilities, and how you can use it in your projects to get the best of both the server-side and client-side world.&lt;/p&gt;
