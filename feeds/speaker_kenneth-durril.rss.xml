Use PDFs with Python the Robust Way</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pyohio-2017/lazy-is-too-hard-use-pdfs-with-python-the-robust-way.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lazy is too hard. When I had 40,000 PDFs and needed to extract their data, I knew that the &amp;quot;lazy&amp;quot; approach was insufficient. This talk reviews tools to tame PDFs with confidence. I'll use my open-data project's workflow as an example (ETL anyone?). It's also a follow-up/response to PyOhio2016's &amp;quot;We Don’t Need No Stinkin’ PDF Library: Build PDFs with Python the Lazy Way&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
