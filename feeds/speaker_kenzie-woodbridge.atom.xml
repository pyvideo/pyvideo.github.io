&lt;p&gt;You have found a secret room in the castle! You gain 26 xp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You enter a large interior space with stone walls and a high stone
ceiling. Torches flicker in wall brackets. A large self-referential
tapestry hanging on the north wall shows a guild workshop full of happy
weavers busily weaving the very tapestry in which they are depicted.
There are exits to the east, west, and south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linden&lt;/strong&gt; , another player, is here. &lt;strong&gt;Gwyrian&lt;/strong&gt; , another player, is
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;gt; say &amp;quot;Hi&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say &amp;quot;Hi&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwyrian says &amp;quot;Hey! Do you want to explore this area together?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linden attacks you with a critical hit from their sword!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are dead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people: sometimes difficult to work with and often impossible to
predict. In your technical or documentation project, how can you get the
right people interested and involved? How can you keep those people
happily engaged until the work is done? Is there anything you can do to
prevent griefing… err, “interpersonal difficulties” from causing delays?
And why do some people seem to thrive in an environment with poor
documentation and how can you encourage them to participate in
effectively documenting everything anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll explore ways to accomplish these aims, using
strategies drawn from “Player Type Theory” . For 20 years, this theory
has been employed by game designers to encourage stable long-term play
communities in online multiplayer games. These are strategies that I
have used successfully in my workplace and they can work for you too.&lt;/p&gt;
