&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the growth of AJAX and other client-side technologies many Python
programmers, web-applications increasingly involve large amounts of
JavaScript. Many of us find that, just to keep doing our job, we have
understand JavaScript better. This tutorial, which was also given at
EuroPython 2009, 2010 and 2011, provides an introduction to JavaScript
that emphasises the similarities and differences between Python and
JavaScript. It has a focus on the concepts underlying JavaScript, and in
particular the object model and the lack of built-in classes. It also
covers quite a few JavaScript gotchas and other traps for the unwary.
This course is suitable for those who are Beginners or better in Python.
Previous JavaScript knowledge is not required, but would helpful. This
course was prepared and previously delivered by Jonathan Fine. I was
assisting in the course in 2010 as a helper and worked a little on
improving the materials during the sprints. I intend to improve the
materials further and bring them up to date with recent developments in
the JavaScript world, and then deliver the tutorial, because Jonathan
will not be attending the conference this year.&lt;/p&gt;
