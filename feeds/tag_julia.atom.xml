Today, you can write high performance code in Julia instead, which is much much easier for Python users. This tutorial will give you hands-on experience writing a Python library that incorporates Julia for performance optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia is a modern data science language which solves the two-language problem by being both easy to use and high performant. Although different from Python, the language can be quickly learned by Python users, making it a good choice for speeding up pieces of code. Julia, in addition to being a similar language, is designed for high-performance applied mathematics and has high-quality libraries for multi-dimensional arrays, dataframes, distributed computing and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older alternative of writing pieces of code in C, C++, Cython or Rust is much more cumbersome: Here, programmers have to cope with a low-level language, static types, pointers, no garbage collector, lack of scientific libraries and other difficulties not normally faced by Python users. There was simply no better alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial will be fully hands-on, using Jupyter Notebook and Binder to provide a smooth and easy-to-use environment for each participant. Both Julia and Python work seamlessly within Jupyter. We start with an introduction to the basics of Julia, focusing on the core differences with Python and how to work around common translation difficulties. Then we'll take a look at the interfaces between Julia and Python and build a Python sample project that runs Julia code. Finally, we will benchmark our solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tutorial you will be able to use Julia to speed up your Python code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia is a performance oriented language written from the ground-up to support numerical processing and parallelisation. The basic syntax of Julia resembles a cross between Matlab and Python, but offers performance which is comparable to compiled C-code. I will present an overview of the language with particular emphasis on where Python users may benefit in using it in their daily work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python users have long benefitted from the less verbose nature of Python, when compared with C and Fortran. However, Python was originally designed for scripting tasks, using dynamic types and widescale object orientation, neither of which features are necessarily beneficial when it comes to numerical computing. Thus, we have seen the widespread use of Python libraries for numerical computation (scipy, numpy, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia is a new language, developed at MIT, which attempts to learn from the experience of development of Python and similar languages. The main goals are to provide a non-verbose, performance oriented language written from the ground-up to support numerical processing and parallelisation. In its most basic syntax Julia resembles a cross between Matlab and Python, but via compilation through an intermediate level representation (llvm) it offers performance which is comparable to compiled C-code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to argue that Julia is ready for primetime yet. However, it is definitely worth consideration by anyone currently resorting to cython or needing distributed access to large datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will present an outline/introduction to the language, including the main benefits and current weaknesses. Of particular interest to the audience may be the fact that Python libraries are importable and callable from within Julia, allowing a continuity of existing workflow but from a Julia-based host environment. My main focus will be for a numerically literate audience who are already contending with the technical limitations of Python and are curious about the new language in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia is a new, up-and-coming language that has many similarities to
Python, but some differences. One of its main advantages is the speed
gain obtained by automatically compiling all code (in a somewhat similar
way to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;PyPy&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Cython&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;numba&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.), despite having an
interactive interface very similar to that of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a tutorial on the basic features of Julia from scratch,
given by a user (rather than a developer) of the language, emphasising
those features which are similar to Python (and hence do not require
much explanation) and those features which are rather different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the tutorial is to give an idea of why there is suddenly
such a buzz around Julia and why it can be useful for certain projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is aimed at people who are already familiar with the basic
scientific Python packages; it is not aimed at beginners in scientific
programming.&lt;/p&gt;
