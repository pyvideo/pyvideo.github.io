[EuroPython 2015]
[24 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see users starting to use your feature, you feel very proud
and fulfilled. So why feel this only once every few weeks, why not
feel it every day? In this talk I will show how we changed our
workflow to automate deployment of code changes to production every
time a feature is ready - sometimes even few times per day. I will
present how to successfully combine open-source tools like Git,
Jenkins, Buildout, Fabric, uWSGI, and South, in order to simplify the
process and make it more reliable. I will discuss challenges that we
faced implementing this workflow in a real project based on Django and
how we resolved them. During this talk you will gain the knowledge
required to implement Continuous Deployment in your own project.&lt;/p&gt;
