With signac, users can track, search, and archive data and metadata for file-based workflows and automate workflow submission on high performance computing (HPC) clusters. We will discuss recent growth in the software's feature set, scalability, scientific applications, usability, and community. Newly implemented synced data structures, workflow subgraph execution, and performance optimizations will be covered, as well as recent research using the framework and the project's efforts on improving documentation, contributor onboarding, and governance.&lt;/p&gt;
