Business
logic and process analysis, reinventing the wheel and questioning every
line of code are what we do best. But when it comes to making this very
complex systems work for users, we are quickly frustrated, because it
feels like they just don't get it. As people of code, we are no longer
regular users because we understand what is going on behind the curtains
of the big show that is called a User Interface. What means, that by
default, users have a totally different experience then we developers
do. In this talk, I want to extend my lightning talk from last year to
half an hour, to give you some tips on how to get a users perspective on
the user interface you want or have to create.&lt;/p&gt;
