electronics and programming to create games using MicroPython and a
micro:bit board. In this talk you'll learn how the micro:bit board works
with MicroPython and how you can use push buttons, an accelerometer
sensor and a LED display to create interactive games. The game examples
will be Chase the Dot, Genius and Car Crash. For each game we'll see how
the game works, the source code and a demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MicroPython is an re-implementation of Python targeted to
microcontrollers. It's optimized to run on devices that have constrained
memory and CPU power . It makes it easier to interact with hardware,
compared with low level languages such as C and C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial you'll learn how to use the resources of the BBC
micro:bit, an open source embedded device that lets you control
electronic components using MicroPython. Some of the components you'll
learn to use in this tutorial include: * Push buttons * 5x5 LED matrix
* Accelerometer sensor * Radio communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the tutorial is to implement a version of the Battleship
game that can be controlled using the accelerometer sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is designed for attendees with a basic understanding of
Python. No prior knowledge of electronics is required. The tutorial will
cover all necessary concepts from the ground up, making it suitable for
those who are new to the world of electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
