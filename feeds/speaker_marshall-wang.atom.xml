their Python implementations to build AI's that can play LaserCat, a
video game written with Pygame. We start with building an imitation AI
that can imitate a human player's decision-making. Then we build a
self-evolving AI that can explore and learn on its own to eventually
achieve super-human level.&lt;/p&gt;
