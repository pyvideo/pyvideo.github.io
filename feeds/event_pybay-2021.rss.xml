&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION
There has been a strong drumbeat to move away from server-side programming and lean more and more heavily on JavaScript, especially for dynamic and interactive web sites. With the recent release of HTMX, there is another path Python developers can choose. Use declarative programming on the client side with nearly pure HTML and CSS and double down on back-end Python (Flask, Django, FastAPI, and other frameworks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Michael Kennedy will present some of the cleanest Flask code you have seen while at the same time adding rich interactivity on the front-end -- all the while with no JavaScript in side. It's a new, and likely better, way to think about building dynamic Python web apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION
Python is great at helping ideas and companies get off the ground quickly. It is elegant, simple and offers great library support for getting ideas off the ground and into the hands of customers. But with success we need to adjust the way we write python to support more &amp;quot;enterprise&amp;quot; development. This space is filled with industry buzzwords like Domain Driven Design, Hexagonal architecture, design patterns, CQRS, Kafka, and the list goes on and on. But what is missing is advice on how to structure your classes, package and overall code to support this intimidating world of enterprise development. This talks is about those techniques to keep you code simple regardless of framework choices that made you successful in the first place while preventing the dreaded &amp;quot;rewrite&amp;quot; phase of your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPEAKER BIO

&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION
Good data for testing can be a nightmare to manage. Sometimes, teams don’t have much control over the data in their systems under test—it’s just dropped in, and it can change arbitrarily. Other times, teams need to build their own data sets, either before testing or during testing. Inaccurate data can leave test gaps. Incorrect or stale data can break tests. Large data can consume too much time. Ugh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll cover strategies for defeating many types of test data nightmares:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recognizing the difference between product data and test case data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deciding when to prepare data statically beforehand or dynamically during testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using data to control how tests run or reflect product state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hard-coding values versus discovering data in the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoiding collisions on shared data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategies we cover can be applied to any project in any language. After this talk, you will wake up from the nightmare and handle test data cleanly and efficiently like a pro!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION
What is your Python application doing in production? How do you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logs, events, and metrics are all concepts that are bandied about for the elusive goal of &amp;quot;observability&amp;quot;. When should you use structlog? Is OpenTelemetry worth it? How do you integrate with Prometheus? What sort of data goes where?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION
In this talk we discuss why the polyglot approach to development is sometimes not only necessary but inevitable. We will discuss the benefits to this approach as well as the downsides that can be a challenge to overcome. We will discuss how Python specifically fits into a polyglot design pattern and why it could help bridge gaps in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the language you prefer to develop in, theres a place for you in the polyglot architecture I will cover. Come learn how you can superpower the innovation and agility of your application development using modern open source tools!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION
In this talk, we will overview standard methods for hyperparameter tuning: grid search, random search, and bayesian optimization. We will also showcase the cutting edge methods such as BOHB, BlendSearch and HyperSched. We will discuss the challenges of using diverse libraries and algorithms in order to experiment and implement cutting edge optimization. Then, we will showcase Ray Tune and its sklearn-wrapper, tune-sklearn, which present a unified API for distributed hyperparameter optimization and how simple tune-sklearn is to use and integrate within existing scikit-learn based pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
