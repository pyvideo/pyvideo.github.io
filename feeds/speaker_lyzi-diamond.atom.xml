editing the work of others than writing ourselves. When you have a large
team or a large product (or both!), the cooks in the documentation
kitchen come from all parts of the company: marketing, product,
engineering, sales, and more. This adds a significant burden on you and
your team to make sure the content they produce is accurate, fits within
your style guide, uses the correct tone, and doesn''t add additional
confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Mapbox, we have both a large team and a complex product, which means
many different writers with individual writing styles and varying depth
of knowledge of the product. To keep our work accurate and unified under
a common voice while avoiding breaking our necks with editing, we
implemented an automated content testing system (fully open source!) to
do some of the work for us. Automated tests have helped us embed quality
writing and editing into the development process as much as code testing
does. &amp;quot;It''s not finished until it''s documented&amp;quot; is more than just a
happy thought -- it''s now an immovable part of our workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will discuss the reasons you might want to implement an
automated testing system in your organization, examples of how it''s
been beneficial, the story of how we set up our system, and a brief
overview of the tools that exist for doing this work. I''ll also cover
the ways that automated tests can sometimes make funny mistakes and how
we found the balance between making tests too precise and not precise
enough. For those who are interested in implementing right away, I will
also provide a comprehensive list of resources for getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
