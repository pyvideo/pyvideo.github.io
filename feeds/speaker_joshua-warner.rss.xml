This tutorial will introduce image analysis using the idea that &amp;quot;images are just NumPy arrays&amp;quot;. Then we will run through various fundamental image analysis operations (filters, morphology, segmentation), and finally we will demonstrate one or two advanced real-world examples. This tutorial is aimed at people who are familiar with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, but it does not require any previous knowledge of image analysis or image processing.&lt;/p&gt;

are producing more images than they can manually inspect. This tutorial
will introduce automated image analysis using the idea that &amp;quot;images are
just numpy arrays&amp;quot;. Then we will run through various fundamental image
analysis operations(filters, morphology, segmentation), and finally we
will demonstrate one or two advanced real-world examples. This tutorial
is aimed at people who are familiar with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib,
but it does not require any previous knowledge of image analysis or
