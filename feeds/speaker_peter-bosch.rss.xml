requirements: the benefits of cloud services in accelerating
development, while at the same time handling security in an adverse
environment where there are more attack surfaces and opportunities for
data breaches. Unfortunately, many security tools do not address the
vulnerabilities of APIs that run in those containers. Cloud-native
applications expose many internal API services and developers are
increasingly using external API services for their applications. Both
internal and external API use expose the workload to new
vulnerabilities; more strongly, workload security and API security are
really two sides to the same coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk specifically focuses on the security problems and
vulnerabilities exposed through APIs, and introduces Cisco’s Panoptica,
a tool for discovering, managing, and repairing these vulnerabilities,
and APIClarity, Panoptica’s open source core.&lt;/p&gt;
