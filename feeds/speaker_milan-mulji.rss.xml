difficult than it may seem upfront. We have to take into consideration
full machine learning lifecycle, which allows focusing not only on the
development of the model but also on the production and monitoring
parts. During this tutorial, we practice building full machine learning
lifecycle using MLFlow as the main tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing a machine learning project to a successful conclusion is more
difficult than it may seem upfront. We have to take into consideration
full machine learning lifecycle, which allows focusing not only on the
development of the model but also on the production and monitoring
parts. Thankfully, there are mature tools available to manage machine
learning lifecycle. One of the tools for end-to-end machine learning
lifecycle management is the open- source platform MLflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the tutorial we are going to deep dive into main MLFlow
components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MLflow tracking: using an API and UI to track/log/visualize machine
learning experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mlflow projects: using standardized format to package reusable data
science code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mlflow models: using provided tools to deploy common model types to
diverse platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
