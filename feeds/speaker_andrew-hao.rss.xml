How can building a TensorFlow-powered cry-detection baby monitor help me understand my little one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a beginner or just curious about machine learning, this talk is for you. Together, we'll go on a ML discovery journey to train a TensorFlow model to recognize and quantify the cries of my little one. We'll see how it works by walking through a keyword-spotting CNN described from a Google research paper, then see how it's deployed on a Raspberry Pi. In the process, you'll see how simple it is to train and deploy an audio recognition model!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the model deliver on its promise to deliver sleep training insights to this sleep-deprived parent? And what can training a model on human inputs teach us about building production models in the real world?&lt;/p&gt;
