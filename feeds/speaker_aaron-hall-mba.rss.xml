If one firm offers X and another Y, the matter may be straightforward if everything else is equal. But that is rarely the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we value options? How do we deal with the uncertainty of vesting and company performance? Should we value perks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present introductory financial theory, with pure Python functions first, and the objects delegating calculations to Numpy, to answer these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker has an MBA, works in finance, has taught Python at Columbia and NYU, and is a former business professor and financial advisor.&lt;/p&gt;
