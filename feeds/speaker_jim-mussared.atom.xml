It runs two streams - Python web development, and embedded electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we updated the embedded stream to use the BBC micro:bit and MicroPython. It was a tremendous success, we learned a lot, and we're excited to share our experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

Wouldn't it be great to be able to explore this magic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, this was out of reach of a hobbyist and required a wide range of skills from analog electronics to signal processing. However, software-defined radio (SDR) has changed all this and playing with radio is now in the reach of more people than ever before. Better yet, you can use Python for the &amp;quot;software-defined&amp;quot; bit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is a brief introduction to radio theory, software-radio, GNU Radio and other Python-based tools, why you might be interested, how to get started, and some demos. We'll also look at exploring some basic FMCW radar concepts using MicroPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No prior radio or electronics experience necessary!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/110/view_talk"&gt;https://2016.pycon-au.org/schedule/110/view_talk&lt;/a&gt;
Embedded programming allows students to take their programs into the physical world - to build robots and interactive gadgets with sensors and displays. Until recently, this has been almost exclusively the domain of lower level languages like C which is not known for its beginner friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MicroPython is an optimized implementation of Python 3 designed to be run on the sort of embedded microcontrollers that are making their way into the classroom, allowing Python to take the place of C. In particular, the BBC MicroBit, the pyboard and the ESP8266 all now support MicroPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using a language that students are already familiar with, more time can be spent on fun things like building robots and less time debugging code or setting up development tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with teaching embedded programming in a classroom environment is the equipment required - both the actual boards and any additional accessories or modules. We will also demonstrate a browser-based MicroBit simulator which makes embedded programming accessible to more students and also allows for the creation of structured lessons, problems and assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
