As tech writers we want to receive adultation
when the docs rock, or constructive criticism when there is cleanup
required. Or EVEN BETTER, we want the engineers/community members/reddit
readers/clowns giving the feedback to come on board and help fix the
problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But. Actually tweaking the signal to noise ratio to something useful is
really difficult. Especially when you are curating a site as enormous as
MDN, the content of which is open licensed, multilingual, and open for
public editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, MDN writer Chris Mills discusses topics such as how to
choose the right feedback mechanism(s) for your situation, how to stem
the torrent and get the right kind of feedback and contributions
(actually useful), effective begging, stealing and borrowing, and how to
balance being firm and keeping control of your product with being
diplomatic and being able to sleep at night.&lt;/p&gt;
