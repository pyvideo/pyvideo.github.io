Gone are the days where simply knowing one technology really really well is sufficient to stay on the cutting edge. We are expected to write web-based applications, mobile applications, cross-platform applications and so on. Even as we know we should learn more and branch out, that choice is increasingly difficult as the technology options explode.
This talk will give you one very solid choice that is familiar to .NET developers: Python. It may seem like a very different language and ecosystem when compared to .NET but just below the surface, there are many more similarities than there are differences. For .NET's Entity Framework, Python has SQLAlchemy. For .NET's ASP.NET MVC, Python has The Pyramid Web Framework. The list goes on and on.
Come learn why your team should learn Python as a complementary language to .NET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION
There has been a strong drumbeat to move away from server-side programming and lean more and more heavily on JavaScript, especially for dynamic and interactive web sites. With the recent release of HTMX, there is another path Python developers can choose. Use declarative programming on the client side with nearly pure HTML and CSS and double down on back-end Python (Flask, Django, FastAPI, and other frameworks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Michael Kennedy will present some of the cleanest Flask code you have seen while at the same time adding rich interactivity on the front-end -- all the while with no JavaScript in side. It's a new, and likely better, way to think about building dynamic Python web apps.&lt;/p&gt;

Some people were excited for the added functionality and safety they brought to the language. Others saw the Java-ification of Python and thought, &amp;quot;no thanks&amp;quot;. Eight years later, the Python community has generally embraced Python types. We've seen powerful and popular frameworks built upon them (Pydantic and FastAPI for example) and tools to fully analyze your code from a typing angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the foundations and history of Python typing. Then we will see some of the common syntax and examples for easily bringing typing into your programming habits. Then we will dive into 5 amazing ways typing can help you write and run better code. Time permitting, we'll close out the session with advice on Python typing guidance, patterns, and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

mean? This talk will take you on a tour of some of the more important
pythonic concepts. You will see many examples of perfectly functional
Python code that is quite non-pythonic. We will evolve that code into
more an idiomatic form that fits better with the Python language and its
users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you new to running web apps in production? Do you have that nagging feeling that you should improve the ways you structure, deploy, and develop your app? Want to see some lessons learned from running a group of Pyramid web apps on a cluster of Linux servers? Join the talk as Michael Kennedy, founder of Talk Python, as he shares his top 10 list of lessons learned running a variety of web apps over the past 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is open to all frameworks. Whether you use Pyramid, Flask, or Django, most of the tips and tricks will apply to your web apps you're building and deploying today.&lt;/p&gt;

Python's memory story is not often told. We hear it uses reference counting and that's about the end of it. But there is so much more going on. There is also a GC backing up reference counting, why? Instagram turned theirs off and got faster, how? Python classes can be memory hogs. But there is an escape hatch that is almost always available to us which uses much less memory and is faster computationally. Yet, almost no one opens it. You might want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Michael Kennedy from Talk Python Training and look at how Python memory works and design patterns for functions and classes making Python more efficient (memory-wise) and get a solid speed boost as a side benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
