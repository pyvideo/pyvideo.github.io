mean? This talk will take you on a tour of some of the more important
pythonic concepts. You will see many examples of perfectly functional
Python code that is quite non-pythonic. We will evolve that code into
more an idiomatic form that fits better with the Python language and its
users.&lt;/p&gt;

Gone are the days where simply knowing one technology really really well is sufficient to stay on the cutting edge. We are expected to write web-based applications, mobile applications, cross-platform applications and so on. Even as we know we should learn more and branch out, that choice is increasingly difficult as the technology options explode.
This talk will give you one very solid choice that is familiar to .NET developers: Python. It may seem like a very different language and ecosystem when compared to .NET but just below the surface, there are many more similarities than there are differences. For .NET's Entity Framework, Python has SQLAlchemy. For .NET's ASP.NET MVC, Python has The Pyramid Web Framework. The list goes on and on.
Come learn why your team should learn Python as a complementary language to .NET.&lt;/p&gt;
