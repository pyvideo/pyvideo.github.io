is critical. The application must be delivered properly to customers
and users. And with frequent releases, manual testing is exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore developers need integration and system tests, aside from
basic unit tests - to make sure their commits are integrated properly
and did not break anything. No more: one hotfix creates two new bugs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For beginners: I will give a brief introduction to software testing
and its types and talk about how easy is to start with writing
automatic tests in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For advanced: I will present integration testing of Cleerio web
mapping application (originally written in JavaScript and PHP) using
Python together with Selenium project.&lt;/p&gt;
