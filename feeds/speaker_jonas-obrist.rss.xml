excellent strategy to do so. To build a production ready system, you
would use asyncio, tornado, twisted, trio or another popular
implementation. However, to fully understand how and why it works, I
will ignore these solutions and instead craft an artisanal asynchronous
implementation in front of your very eyes. Step by step we will turn a
blocking socket server, only capable of handling a single connection at
a time, into a beautiful non blocking server that has no trouble dealing
with many connections at once. By the end, you should see that
asynchronous code is not magical at all, but nevertheless incredibly
useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a Python developer from Switzerland, living in Japan. I got started with Python developing modifications for the video game Counter-Strike before getting my first job building websites using Django. There I got involved with the popular open source Content Management System django CMS. Nowadays I work primarily with the Tornado framework and various asyncio libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

talk, the speaker will show this is not the case. In 100 lines of code,
he will write a low level async network stack in front of your eyes,
explaining how things work as we go. By the end, you should understand
how and why async code works!&lt;/p&gt;

community, especially with the rise of popularity of Python 3 and the
new asyncio library in its standard library. However, it can still be
a confusing and mysterious concept. In this talk, I will explain what
async programming is, how it works and how it could benefit you. My
goal of this talk is that at the end of it, you have an idea about
what we mean when we say asynchronous programming in Python and you
know how and when to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the talk, I will dive into what asynchronous
programming is and what it isn't. Explaining the difference between
IO bound code and CPU bound code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I will explain how this actually works in Python, explaining the
idea of an event loop, coroutines and cooperative multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I will talk about why this may be beneficial, what kind of
applications can really benefit from this and provide some examples
from my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Jonas Obrist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does Django make it that hard to have translated database contents?
And what solutions are there to make it easier? And how can Django make
multilingual database contents less of a pain?&lt;/p&gt;

in Python led me to start a project called pymaging. Pymaging is a pure
Python image processing library that works on Python 2.x and 3.x. This
talk will dive into why I started this project, how I dug into the
problems, what I learned about image formats and my goals for the future
of this project.&lt;/p&gt;
