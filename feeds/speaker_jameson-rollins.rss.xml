&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been searching for the elusive gravitational wave for
more than half a century.  On September 14, 2015, the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) finally observed
the gravitational wave signature from the merger of two black holes.
This detection marks the dawn of a new age of &lt;em&gt;gravitational wave
astronomy&lt;/em&gt;, where we routinely hear the sounds emanating from deep
within the most energetic events in the Universe.  This talk will
cover the events leading up to one of the most important discoveries
of the last century, and the myriad of ways in which Python enabled
the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
