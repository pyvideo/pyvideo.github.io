Do you want to leverage massive vectorization and high-throughput accelerators for evolution strategies (ES)? evosax allows you to leverage JAX, XLA compilation and auto-vectorization/parallelization to scale ES to your favorite accelerators. In this talk we will get to know the core API and how to solve distributed black-box optimization problems with evolution strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

Among its strengths are great functionalities such as native TPU support, as well as easy vectorization and parallelization. Nevertheless, making your first steps in JAX can feel complicated given some of its idiosyncrasies. This talk helps new users getting started in this promising ecosystem by sharing practical tips and best practises.&lt;/p&gt;
