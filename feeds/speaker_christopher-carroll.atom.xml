Such models performed poorly in the Great Recession; but progress in&lt;/tt&gt;heterogeneous
agent' modeling has been held back because the tools for working with
such models are primitive. The Econ-ARK/HARK project provides a
Python-based set of tools that make it much easier to get started, and
to make rapid progress, in handling the computational challenges of
taking account of the differences between agents (in preferences, in
incomes, in beliefs) that matter for overall economic
outcomes.Presenter(s): Speaker: Christopher Carroll, Johns Hopkins
