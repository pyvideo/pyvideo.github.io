&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;In this talk, I will present and discuss several tools for automatic
and&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;interactive image processing with Python. I will start by a short&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;introduction to scikit-image (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-image.org/"&gt;https://scikit-image.org/&lt;/a&gt;), the
open-source&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;image processing toolkit of the Pydata ecosystem, which aims at&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;processing images from a large class of modalities (2-D, 3-D, etc.)
and&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;strives to have a gentle learning curve with pedagogical example-based&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;documentation. scikit-image provides users with a simple API based on
a large number of functions, which can be used to build pipelines of
image processing workflows.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;In a second part, I will explain how to use Dash for building
interactive&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;image processing operations. Dash (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dash.plot.ly/"&gt;https://dash.plot.ly/&lt;/a&gt;) is an&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;open-source Python web application framework developed by Plotly.
Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is meant for
building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in
pure Python. The dash-canvas component library of Dash
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dash.plot.ly/canvas"&gt;https://dash.plot.ly/canvas&lt;/a&gt;) is an interactive component for
annotating images with several tools (freehand brush, lines, bounding
boxes, ...). It also provides utility functions for using
user-provided annotations for several image processing tasks such as
segmentation, transformation, measures, etc. The latter functions are
based on libraries such scikit-image and openCV. A gallery of examples
showcases some typical uses of Dash for image processing on&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dash-canvas.plotly.host/"&gt;https://dash-canvas.plotly.host/&lt;/a&gt;. Also, other components of Dash can
be leveraged easily to build powerful image processing applications,
such as widgets to tune parameters or data tables for inspecting
object&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;properties.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identified in December 2019, the novel Coronavirus has infected 2.7 million worldwide, and claimed the lives of 0.2 million. Amidst this deadly pandemic, I started my open source project, Corona-Net, in the hopes of contributing to the global fight against the Coronavirus. Corona-Net is a 3-part project dedicated to the classification, binary segmentation and multi-class segmentation of COVID-19. I first leverage the EfficientNet model for COVID-19 diagnosis, then utilise and refine the U-Net architecture for both binary and 3-class (ground-glass, consolidation, pleural effusion) segmentation of COVID-19 symptoms, through inference on the COVID-19 CT segmentation (chest axial CT) dataset. Through Corona-Net, I aim to develop a reliable, visual-semantically balanced method for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as extend an invitation to all to collaborate and stand together against this pandemic. My PyTorch code is publicly available at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chinglamchoi/Corona-Net"&gt;https://github.com/chinglamchoi/Corona-Net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of advancements are happening in the field of Deep Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks are one of them. We have seen GANs being applied for photo editing and in-painting, generating new image datasets and realistic photographs, increasing resolution of images (Super Resolution), and many more things. Some people have also exploited GANs for generating fake content. All the above-mentioned examples are result of a technique where the focus is to generate uncommon yet original samples from scratch. However, these examples have very less commercial applications and GANs are capable of doing much more. The focus of this talk is a technique called &amp;quot;Neural Style Transfer (NST)&amp;quot; which has numerous commercial applications in the gaming world, fashion/design industry, mobile applications, and many more fields. Challenges and technicalities of NSTs will be covered in great detail. We will teach the machines on how to paint images and utilize Style Transfer networks to generate artistic artefacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flow of the talk will be as follows:
~ Self Introduction [1 minute]
~ A Succinct Prelude to GANs [10 minutes]
~ Understanding Style Transfer [5 minutes]
~ Learning about Neural Style Transfer Networks [5 minutes]
~ Loss Functions: Content, Style, Total Variantion [10 minutes]
~ Code Walkthrough and Result Analysis [5 minutes]
~ Challenges and Applications [5 minutes]
~ Questions and Answers Session [3-4 minutes]&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://copernicus.eu"&gt;http://copernicus.eu&lt;/a&gt;) makes it possible to perform terrestrial
observations providing data for all kinds of purposes. One important
objective is to monitor the land-use and land-cover changes with the
Sentinel-2 satellite mission. These satellites measure the sun
reflectance on the earth surface with multispectral cameras (13 channels
between 440 nm to 2190 nm). Machine learning techniques like
convolutional neural networks (CNN) are able to learn the link between
the satellite image (spectrum) and the ground truth (land use class). In
this talk, we give an overview about the state-of-the-art land-use
classification with CNNs based on an open dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EuroSAT benchmark dataset (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://madm.dfki.de/downloads"&gt;http://madm.dfki.de/downloads&lt;/a&gt;) is freely
provided by German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI).
It consists of 27.000 image patches for ten different land use/cover
classes, e.g. industrial and residential areas, different crop and
vegetation types and forests. All samples have 64 by 64 pixel dimension
and include either only the RGB images or all 13 bands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use different out-of-box CNNs for the Keras deep learning
library (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://keras.io/"&gt;https://keras.io/&lt;/a&gt;). All networks are either included in Keras
itself or are available from Github repositories. We will show the
process of transfer learning for the RGB datasets. Furthermore, the
minimal changes required to apply commonly used CNNs to multispectral
data are demonstrated. Thus, the interested audience will be able to
perform their own classification of remote sensing data within a very
short time. Results of different network structures are visually
compared. Especially the differences of transfer learning and learning
from scratch are demonstrated. This also includes the amount of
necessary training epochs, progress of training and validation error and
visual comparison of the results of the trained networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we give a quick overview about the current research topics
including recurrent neural networks for spatio-temporal land-use
classification and further applications of multi- and hyperspectral
data, e.g. for the estimation of water parameters and soil
characteristics. Additionally, we provide links to the code and dataset
used in this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk I will describe how we are building an image recognition system with the aim of identifying all known species in the natural world. The system has gone through a number of iterations at this point using a variety of computer vision and machine learning techniques, from nearest neighbour search to classification with fine tuned deep convolutional networks. All of this has been implemented in Python using scikit-learn, Numpy, Caffe and Tensorflow. Aside from the obvious machine learning challenges in designing and training such a system we faced numerous technical challenges while implementing and scaling this system in a cost effective manner. I will discuss these challenges, our solutions and the remaining open problems.

&lt;p&gt;Brief Description Deep Learning is revolutionizing both Data Science and
Artificial Intelligence real-world applications. Yet, being the
discipline so young, it’s not straightforward to understand both the
reasoning at its core and its countless use cases. In this talk we will
review the basics of Neural Networks, from the classical CNNs to the
current state of the art, comparing them through real industry
applications and highlighting pros and cons in a business setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract / Summary Deep Learning has been on a hype roll for a few
years. Being such a young discipline makes deep learning interesting,
but also subject to misunderstandings. Every year, brand new
architectures rise, taking over old ones and outperforming state of the
art benchmarks for accuracy. Further, the applications of deep learning
are at the core of some of the most advanced technologies like
autonomous driving, personal assistants, and customer profiling. In such
a context it is not straightforward to grasp what is at the core of deep
learning itself, and what is common to all the architectures, neither to
realize how concrete use cases can be tackled. Using Python, we’ll take
the audience from the simplest neuron, the atom of the deep learning
world, to the most recent architectures. We’ll achieve this using a
simple Convolutional Neural Network as a building block and comparing
that to the latest breakthroughs in image recognition. In doing this
we’ll try to give an answer to the following questions: • Is deep
learning actually useful in a business setting? • What about state of
the art techniques in the Computer Vision field: are we just stacking
more and more convolutional and pooling layers? We will then address
real industry applications (e.g. the insurance sector) using analyzed
techniques. This will include opening some of these so- called black box
models and retraining them, at least partially, on our datasets, or
building a complete brand new network from scratch, tailoring it
according to the application needs and datasets characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

multi-modal classification models far outperform both text- and
image-only models. This talk will review work that extends Kiela et
al.’s (2018) research by determining if accuracy in classification may
be increased by the implementation of transfer learning in language
processing. The performance of the model over a MM-IMDb (Arevalo et al.
2017) dataset is analyzed and compared to the baseline provided by Kiela
et al. (2018).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is implemented with PyTorch and the goal of the talk will be to
review details of the implementation, and performance of the model as
compared to that recorded in Kiela et al. (2018). Attendees of this talk
should have a basic familiarity with neural nets developed in PyTorch
for the purposes of NLP and computer vision.&lt;/p&gt;

When the user uploads several object images, we internally use Python OpenCV to regenerate them into various image types so that they can be used for model training. I will introduce the results I was able to obtain through this and the parts I was concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;
