In this talk, we'll talk about how digital audio works from the ground up (from sounds, to bytes, to files), how you can use Python to do a bunch of really neat things with audio, and how a Python library - Pedalboard - helps make working with audio much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever used a digital audio workstation (DAW) like GarageBand, Ableton Live, Logic, or Pro Tools? Today's musicians use DAWs as instruments in themselves. But what if you want to combine the power of a DAW with the flexibility of writing your own code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedalboard was built to fill this niche: to pull the power of a DAW into your Python code. Pedalboard makes it easy to build and apply audio effects, read and write audio files, and load audio plug-ins (&amp;quot;VSTs&amp;quot;) without any complicated dependencies or frameworks. Just import pedalboard and go!&lt;/p&gt;

Pedalboard)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python can do (nearly) anything, but using Python to work with audio has always been a complicated and messy affair. In this talk, we'll be going through how digital audio works, how Python can be used to play with audio data, and how a new library - Pedalboard - can help. Pedalboard is a simple, fast, and performant library for doing common audio tasks in Python, including applying effects, using VSTs and audio plugins, and encoding/decoding various audio formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter is a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Spotify in New York, where he helps lead their Audio Intelligence Lab - a machine learning research lab dedicated to pushing the state of the art in audio-based machine learning. He's secretly Canadian (howdy neighbour!) and when not hacking on audio software, he plays drums and bass in a handful of bands.&lt;/p&gt;
