framework for data scientists to create powerful, dynamic web
applications using only Python. In order to utilize the power of our
machine-intelligence platform, we need to be able to quickly generate
web applications to cater to different client solutions. We wanted to
move standard data analysis workflows out of the command line, and into
sleek, modern web apps that allow for dynamic construction of charts,
tables, and other visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our talk will focus on how we addressed this problem statement with the
development of an application framework built on Django, Channels, and
React. We picked these technologies for several reasons. Django is
already an incredibly powerful web framework, and we realized very early
on that we could use Django Models, Forms, and Form Validation to serve
as the core of our backend. However, we opted to take a different
approach than server-side rendering, and opted to utilize React on the
frontend to display large trees of dynamically-generated components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To connect these two segments, we decided to use websockets, via Django
Channels. Our machine intelligence platform is incredibly powerful, and
it allows us to perform tasks on big data with long-running jobs, such
as topological modeling, auto-group generation, and feature selection.
We use Channels as a way for the Django server to notify the React
client on updates to these processes and to refresh different charts and
tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we designed our own Python SDK to allow data scientists to
easily generate Python objects which are serialized and converted into
React components. A developer using this framework doesn’t need to know
Django, React, or Channels, but can utilize the power of all three in
concert to quickly prototype powerful machine-learning applications with
appealing user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this talk, we will focus on how these technologies interact
with one another, the benefits of these design-choices, and the
challenges that we faced. The potential applications of this
architecture extend far beyond our solutions, and it’s valuable for
listeners to understand how Django can be used outside of traditional
contexts. Hopefully this talk will inspire other Django developers to
consider how their apps can utilize websockets, client- side rendering,
and other web-development paradigms to address different and unique
use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;
