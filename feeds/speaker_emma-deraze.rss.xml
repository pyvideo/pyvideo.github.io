&lt;p&gt;Description
DataKind UK share their experiences and critical success factors from 3 years of learning-by-doing in using data in the service of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Most of us will know data for business as the art and science of using proprietary data to solve high value commercial problems. But how can those same techniques be used to solve societal problems as well? From tackling money laundering through network statistics to establishing the true scale of youth homelessness through Bayesian inference, DataKind UK will share examples of how they’ve partnered with charities to use data for good. Reflecting on what has and hasn’t worked in three years, they will share the critical success factors they’ve identified along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
