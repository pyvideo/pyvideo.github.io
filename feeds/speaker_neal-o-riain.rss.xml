At its heart it's object-oriented, but in this talk I want to discuss how you can use Python to write clean, efficient, and modular functional code. I'll begin by giving a little background on what functional programming is and why you might use it. I'll talk through some of the simple primitives of functional programming, and I'll give some useful examples of functional code for data analysis. The aim is to give a practical and pragmatic introduction to these ideas, covering some of the strengths and weaknesses of Python as a functional language.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll present Áireamhán, a small Lisp-like language that I built (in Python of course), that is, as far as I know, the first and only programming language &lt;em&gt;as Gaeilge&lt;/em&gt;. I'll cover some of the core ideas in language design; lexing, parsing, tokenization, with an emphasis on how you can compactly implement these in Python to build your own language. I'll also discuss the features of Lisp (and Áireamhán), and how these functional programming primitives give us a really powerful framework for computation that inspired some of the parts of Python that we all know and love.&lt;/p&gt;
