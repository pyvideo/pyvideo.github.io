Today, services built on Python 3.5 using asyncio are widely used at Facebook. But as recently as May of 2014 it was actually impossible to use Python 3 at Facebook. Come learn how we cut the Gordian Knot of dependencies and social aversion to the point where new services are now being written in Python 3 and existing codebases have plans to move to Python 3.5.  All without official support or sanction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Rules for Radicals&amp;quot; is a book for community organizers by the late Saul Alinsky on how to unite people to effect positive change in their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

But as recently as May of 2014 it was actually impossible at all to use Python 3 at Facebook. Come learn how we cut the Gordian Knot of dependencies and social aversion to the point where new services are now being written in Python 3 while older Python 2 projects are actively migrated to Python 3. All accomplished by a small group of individual contributors in their spare time. Learn to fight the good fight and upgrade your organization to Python 3 like we did at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

Changes in python version usually mean changes all over the place and managing that can be taxing. Like first party code using deprecated api or Third-party code changing API required to change python versions. Lets go over some bad code examples and ways to improve the experience for everyone. So that maybe in the future upgrades are not so hard.&lt;/p&gt;
