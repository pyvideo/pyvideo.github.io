&lt;p&gt;Presented by Brendan McCane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In first semester 2009, CS at Otago introduced an introductory
programming course using Python. This talk will describe the course and
student outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover the following topics: - the problems of teaching and
learning programming - does language make a difference? - why Python is
a good choice for a first language - the structure of the course -
things that worked well, and things that didn't - what students thought
about it - impact on learning Java in the second semester - changes for
2010 Note: this is a preliminary outline, it's likely that it will
change somewhat before the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]&lt;/p&gt;
