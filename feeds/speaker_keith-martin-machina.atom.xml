propose to develop a simulated robotic application tailored for search
and rescue missions. Central to this endeavor is the integration of a
neural network, trained on pertinent search and rescue data, to
effectively guide the robotic agent towards areas with a high
probability of locating survivors. The neural network's computations
yield a dynamic cost map, which takes into account both traversal costs
and the priority of various regions within the search area. This cost
map serves as a comprehensive tool, continuously furnishing the robotic
agent with insights into the search region and optimizing its search
strategy. Importantly, this approach is conceived to address challenges
inherent in reinforcement learning, such as the lack of a global view
and the need to balance multiple objectives in search and rescue
mission.&lt;/p&gt;
