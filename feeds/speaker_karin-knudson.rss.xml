Such students have the potential to connect data science to its societal context in a sophisticated way. For educators working with such students to support this potential, it is essential to 1) welcome newcomers and center student perspectives and 2) consistently and authentically connect technical content with societal context. We present a framework for teaching Python based introductory data science skills in a highly contextualized and domain flexible environment, based on our experience teaching introductory data science to law and diplomacy students.&lt;/p&gt;

We developed Python software that brings together a family of statistical methods that pair voting outcomes with demographic information to infer voting patterns. In this talk we discuss the statistical models and our implementation using scientific Python tools (most notably PyMC3 and ArviZ) and demonstrate how the software has been applied in service of informing redistricting litigation and mapmaking over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
