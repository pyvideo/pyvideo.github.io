complexity of managing and delivering high reliability systems. Based on
our first-hand experience we see that there does not exist one silver
bullet way of doing DevOps and way how you manage Continuous Delivery
features. At Kiwi.com the transformation went from small applications to
complex micro services architectures. This change did also impact the
infrastructure not only by numbers of servers, also on complexity of the
system and ended with hybrid model of cloud and bare metal solution. In
this talk I will cover how our team of DevOps and Engineers battles with
tasks such as deployment to many enviroments, infrastructure changes,
monitoring and also creation of processes and runbooks. We believe that
this talk can inspire you to adapt changes within your teams and never
stop improving how you manage your infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

Phrased that way, it sounds cool and attractive. No wonder: we took the sentence from Wikipedia. Based on first-hand experience, however, we say scrum leaves a lot to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Exponea we grew our IT and Product teams to 20 people in one year without giving excessive thought the process side. Instead, believing that the greatest asset is people, we have been focusing a lot on talent, motivation, engagement and opinions. In my contribution, I will cover how our team goes about software development, what we have tried and rejected, and how we choose to select future colleagues. It is believed our learnings can benefit small and big teams in startups and corporations alike.&lt;/p&gt;
