presentation formats (jupyter notebook + RISE, streamlit, and quarto)
and graphic libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, altair, powerbi, tableau,
vizzu) in search of greater interactivity when presenting and teaching.
At the same time, I became very interested in the related topic of data
storytelling, which focuses on the skills and hacks to make a
presentation memorable and impactful. I think this combination of
concepts (Python and Data Storytelling) is innovative and has not been
sufficiently explored and taught. During the talk, I will share insights
and suggestions on different skills and technical tools that we can use
to create more engaging, entertaining, and memorable presentations using
Python libraries and programs. Let's make the world better, one
presentation at a time!&lt;/p&gt;
