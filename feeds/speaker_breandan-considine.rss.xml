learning experiments can often be a process of trial and error.
TensorFlow is an open source computing framework that places state of
the art algorithms and tools into developers' hands, allowing you to
rapidly iterate experiments, monitor their results and scale into
production. We'll show you how to train machine learning pipelines from
conception to release with TensorFlow.&lt;/p&gt;
