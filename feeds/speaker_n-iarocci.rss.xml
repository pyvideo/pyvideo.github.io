&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last year we have been working on a full featured, Python
powered, RESTful Web API. We learned quite a few things on REST best
patterns, and we got a chance to put Python’s renowned web capabilities
under review, even releasing a couple Open Source projects in the
process. In my talk I will share what we learned. We will consider
‘pure’ REST API design and its many hurdles. We will look at what Python
as to offer in this field and finally, we will dig further down by
looking at some of the code we developed. Some of the
technologies/stacks I’ll cover are (in no particular order): Flask,
PyMongo, MongoDB, REST, JSON, XML, Heroku. Did you know? Like it or not,
there is going to be a REST API in your future.&lt;/p&gt;
