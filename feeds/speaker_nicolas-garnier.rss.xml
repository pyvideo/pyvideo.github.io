to stand back and look at the lessons we learnt. We’ll discuss about how
to get involved into open source, why you would, and how to remain
credible as a company doing open source. We’ll also go over one of the
most important things in open source: community. How to get people
involved, how to communicate and collaborate effectively, but also how
to work with people you might not be best friends with.&lt;/p&gt;
