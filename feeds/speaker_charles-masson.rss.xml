used forecasting techniques usually fall short when used in a real-time
setting for which computation speed, reactiveness to new patterns,
robustness, and reliability are essential. In this talk, we will discuss
forecasting methods that achieve those goals and will show how Python
tools such as NumPy and Cython can help.&lt;/p&gt;

samples and are used in a variety of machine learning applications. In
this talk, we will show how we use SciPy's statistical distance
functions—some of which we recently contributed—to design powerful and
production-ready anomaly detection algorithms. With visual
illustrations, we will describe the inner workings and the properties of
a few common statistical distances and explain what makes them
convenient to use, yet powerful to solve various problems. We will also
show real-life applications and concrete examples of the anomalous
patterns that such algorithms are able to detect in
performance-monitoring and business-metric time series.Presenter(s):
