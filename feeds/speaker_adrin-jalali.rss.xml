As a scikit-learn core developer, I'd give an update on recent changes, current affairs, and the roadmap of the package and the community packages included in scikit-learn-contrib. I'd also briefly talk about how new method proposals are evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded at the PyConDE &amp;amp; PyData Berlin 2019 conference.

In this tutorial we use PipelineIO, to deploy a cluster on the cloud, which gives us a JupyterHub to develop our method, and uses PMML to persist and deploy and serve the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you have a machine learning module in your pipeline, persisting and serving the model is not yet a trivial task. This tutorial shows how an open source framework using several open source technologies could potentially solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey started with this[1] question on StackOverflow. I wanted to be able to do my usual data science stuff, mostly in python, and then deploy them somewhere serving like a REST API, responding to requests in real-time, using the output of the trained models. My original line of thought was this workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;train the model in python or pyspark or in scala in apache spark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get the model, put it in an apache flink stream and serve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the point at which I had been reading and watching tutorials and attending meetups related to these technologies. I was looking for a solution which is better than:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;train models in python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write a web-service using flask, put it behind a apache2 server, and put a bunch of them behind a load balancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just sounded wrong, or at its best, not scalable. After a bit of research, I came across PipelineIO[2,3] which seems to promise exactly what I'm looking for. In this tutorial we use PipelineIO, to deply a cluster on the cloud, which gives us a JupyterHub to develop our method, and uses PMML to persist and deploy and serve the model. My own jurney and take from PipelineIO are documented github[4]. I'll use Amazon AWS, but PipelineIO uses Kubernetes and you can easily deploy in any environment in which you can use Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work in an environment in which you have different machine learning modules, which should be used in production in real time and as a part of a stream processing pipeline, this talk is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
