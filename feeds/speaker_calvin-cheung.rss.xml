&lt;div class="line"&gt;Part 1 – Digitizing documents with powerful python libraries&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;So.. in the digital era you suddenly realise that until very recently
not all valuable information kept is/was machine friendly, there are
tons of word and pdf documents with reports, meetings minutes,
contracts and so-on waiting to be re-discovered. With python libraries
PdfMiner, PyPDF2 among others, we will unlock the power of text data
in pdf format.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2 – Optimise risk assessment with advanced machine learning models
Traditional risk assessment in insurance process can be based on
creating a set of rules to classify cases that are likely to default.
With powerful machine learning libraries such as SCIKIT-LEARN and
XGBOOST, a probability of default model is trained using historical data
to predict the future cases. In order to understand the decision making
process, we can evaluate the output using Eli5 libraries and create
visualisation tools for the end users.&lt;/p&gt;
