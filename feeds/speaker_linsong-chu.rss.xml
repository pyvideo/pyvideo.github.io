&lt;p&gt;Large-scale model pretraining crucially relies on specialized and dedicated dataloaders that can, for example, partition and stream data asynchronously across multiple processes and physical nodes. In this talk we discuss one of the torch-native dataloaders we built and use at IBM Research for addressing these needs. Intended for use in large-scale model pretraining, particularly in research settings where rapid iteration between datasets may be required, our dataloader is distributed, stateful, checkpointable, composable and rescalable – while remaining a simple extension of the existing PyTorch dataloading framework. It automatically and invisibly handles data sharding, shuffling, subdataset weighting, checkpoint saving and loading, and custom user-defined preprocessing functions, with minimal overhead and high throughput. We discuss these properties and how we achieved them, such as reducing overhead by implementing a custom LCG random number generator, and demonstrate proof of concept on production-scale training of a 7B parameter Llama model over 4 trillion tokens.&lt;/p&gt;

A key challenge in getting torch.compile to perform well is to minimize (or eliminate) graph breaks, however, this isn't trivial as even the Llama implementation provided by Meta has many graph breaks resulting in reduced training throughput. In this talk we discuss 1. how we addressed these challenges in order to train a model using torch.compile 2. how we combined torch.compile with FSDP and selective activation checkpointing to achieve the maximum throughput for training 3. model quality comparison between models trained with compile and no-compile, and lastly 4. the best setup we have for different model sizes in the Llama family that achieves the maximum throughput and MFU number (e.g. 68% MFU for the 7B model on A100 GPUs!)&lt;/p&gt;

It is a repo that showcases PyTorch's latest distributed training features in a clean, minimal codebase. We show-cased end to end large scale training features enablement: 1. 3D/4D Parallelism 2. Efficient distributed checkpoint save/load/resharding 3. Many efficient training techniques including Float8, torch.compile, activation checkpoint, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
