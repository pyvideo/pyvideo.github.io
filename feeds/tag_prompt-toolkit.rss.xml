Or maybe color the output a bit? Or do you want to write an immersive
terminal application like top, or even vim? Then you need to speak a bit
of terminal! This talk describes how to talk to your terminal from
scratch and goes on to show why the Python library prompt-toolkit is so
awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terminal emulators we run so many of our programming tools in are
more powerful than we give them credit for, and the key to that power is
understanding the interface. This talk will cover terminal colors and
styles, writing to arbitrary portions of the screen, handling signals
from the terminal, determining the terminal’s dimensions and scrollback
buffer behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminal programming can get hairy, especially if you want to support
multiple platforms like Mac, Linux and Win; along the way we’ll deal
with encoding issues, automatisation issues and look into 4 decades’ of
terminal communication. By gaining a deeper understanding of these
issues, we’ll be able to choose from the abstractions over them offered
by Python libraries like Blessings, prompt-toolkit, asciimatics etc.&lt;/p&gt;
