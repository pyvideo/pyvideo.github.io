To ensure that those users are equipped with some essential knowledge that will help them smoothly transition to using Notebook 7, this talk will go over some of the key details of working with the new Jupyter Notebook. We will explain how users can run multiple frontends like Notebook 7, JupyterLab and NbClassic (the long term supported version of the Notebook 6 code base) that will ease the transition of users not ready to switch to Notebook 7 as well as give users the freedom to choose between the Notebook 7 and Lab interface based on project needs. Through this talk we will also aim to provide Notebook 6 extension developers with information about the resources available to aid the transition of their extensions to both Notebook 7 and JupyterLab. Notebook users will leave this talk having a better understanding of what next steps they may want to take to get started with Notebook 7.&lt;/p&gt;
