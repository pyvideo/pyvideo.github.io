describing all that awesome stuff. - Is it all that easy? Let’s check!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll look into: style transfer (making a picture look like painting),
speech generation (like Siri or Alexa) and text generation (writing a
story). In this talk I’ll describe the whole journey: A fun ride from
the idea to the very end including all the struggles, failures and
successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an ongoing talk on how far we can get creating a full &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_drama"&gt;radio
drama (Hörspiel)&lt;/a&gt; with
deep learning and the resources required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps, we’ll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data challenge: get the data ready&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a character-level language models with an Recurrent Neural
Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a text generator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating artwork&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synthesising speech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making it sound like a real person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this special PyCon X edition we will also try to recreate text in the
style of Dante’ Divina Commedia.&lt;/p&gt;

computing packages. They range from low-level providers of generic
functionality like NumPy to very domain specific tools like
scikit-learn. A few years back, machine learning frameworks could be
easily classified into the second category, but this is changing now.
They become increasingly powerful and start to be applied in a whole
variety of settings different than their original purpose. In this talk,
I’ll present a basic tour of PyTorch, a relatively new library that has
already gathered a significant user base. I’ll describe features useful
both in machine learning and other domains, explain how it fits into the
Python landscape, and showcase scenarios where it provides benefits over
existing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

Tensorflow has its benefits like wide scale adoption, deployment on mobile, and support for distributed computing, but it also has a somewhat challenging learning curve, is difficult to debug, and hard to deploy in production. PyTorch is a new deep learning framework that solves a lot of those problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyTorch is only in beta, but users are rapidly adopting this modular deep learning framework. PyTorch supports tensor computation and dynamic computation graphs that allow you to change how the network behaves on the fly unlike static graphs that are used in frameworks such as Tensorflow. PyTorch offers modularity which enhances the ability to debug or see within the network and for many, is more intuitive to learn than Tensorflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will objectively look at PyTorch and why it might be the best fit for your deep learning use case and we'll look at use cases that will showcase why you might want consider using Tensorflow instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern neural networks have hundreds of layers! How can we train such deep networks? Simply stacking layers on top doesn't work! This talk introduces the deep learning library PyTorch by explaining the exciting math, cool ideas and simple code behind what makes really deep neural networks work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern neural networks consist of hundreds of computation layers! These very deep architectures consistently outperform shallower networks in a variety of tasks. However just simply stacking layers on top of each other won't work because the gradients are either vanishing or exploding during optimisation procedure. This talk explains the exciting math, cool ideas and elegant code that modern neural network architectures such as ResNets, HighwayNets and DenseNets are applying to circumvent the problem using PyTorch. PyTorch is a relatively new deep learning framework that is deeply integrated into Python. Unlike other frameworks such as TensorFlow and Theano, it uses tape-based automatic differentiation to run computation immediately, supports dynamic neural networks and provides a powerful GPU-accelerated Tensor library. The talk concludes with some real-world use-cases for very deep neural networks in chemical-genetic profiling and autonomous driving.&lt;/p&gt;

scientific computing, mainly
aimed at deep learning workloads. The framework consists of an ndarray
library that natively
supports GPU execution, an automatic differentiation engine that is
flexible and fast, and
an optimization package for gradient based optimization methods. We
shall discuss practical
workflows, our features on top of python multiprocessing for efficient
parallel data loaders
and finally we shall briefly look at our upcoming just-in-time Tensor
compiler to fuse
computations and execute them more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

This scheme is applicable to detection of 'soft' anomalies in arbitrarily distributed highly-dimensional data. A soft, or population, anomaly is characterized by a shift in the distribution of the data set, where certain elements appear with higher or lower probability than anticipated. Such anomalies must be detected by considering a large sample set rather than a single sample. Applications include, but not limited to, payment fraud trends, data exfiltration, and system security and health monitoring. We evaluate the scheme on credit card payment and DNS data exfiltration data and obtain both quantitative results and qualitative insights. We discuss our PyTorch implementation of deep gaussianization, and review implementation details, pitfalls, and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
