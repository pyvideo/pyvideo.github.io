Fortunately, things have been getting better! In this talk, I'll describe how members of the scientific Python community have been working with upstream Python to solve some of the worst issues, and show you how to build and distribute binary wheels for Linux users, build Windows packages without MSVC, use wheels to handle dependencies on non-Python libraries like BLAS or libhdf5, plus give the latest updates on our effort to drive a stake through the heart of setup.py files and replace them with something better.&lt;/p&gt;
