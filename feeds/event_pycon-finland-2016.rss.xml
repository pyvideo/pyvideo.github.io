&lt;p&gt;Python may be one of the simplest and most flexible programming languages out there, but it is still a programming language. It still has syntax, datatypes, and some occasional dark corners. Python &amp;quot;&amp;quot;warts&amp;quot;&amp;quot; are things for which people have criticised Python, typically aspects of the language or mechanisms of its implementation, because such aspects either expose certain surprising inconsistencies, are regarded as omissions, or cause irritation for parts of the community in some sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be about common pitfalls (termed warts/landmines) that people face using Python programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author: Manoj Pandey is a rising CS junior, who speaks Python primarily and worked with SquadRun's Engineering Team this summer. Before this he was a Data Analytics Intern at Inspiration Edge and Zouk Fellow at ZoukLoans. He is an avid FOSS enthusiast and Pythonista, almost all of his projects are open-sourced on Github (manojpandey).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How EFF's Let's Encrypt client Certbot is addressing the issues with skill and effort needed in effective, secure TLS adoption and the sysadmin overhead of keeping the certificates and configuration up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll be going over the philosophy behind Certbot client, it's role in the progression of web technologies in paraller with Let's Encrypt project (and possibly upcoming ACME protocol support by other CAs). It's centered around Certbot internals, while touching subjects like configuration management using Python (Apache / Nginx), ACME protocol integration, release management from security perspective - leveraging PyPI, pip version pinning, and hash checking mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is going to have multiple demos, showing various aspects and uses for Certbot client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author:  Joona Hoikkala is a Certbot development team member who has been involved with the project from the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet is full of data but it's not always easily obtainable in a format that is analyzable or presented in an optimal way. Data scraping - pulling data from websites - gives you access to a whole new world of working with data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk I'll go through the basics of data scraping in Python using a popular BeautifulSoup library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional programming is a quite popular paradigm nowadays, but it suffers from a lot of myths and misunderstandings around it. And one of them is that functional programming can be applied only in few special languages, which is wrong. This paradigm is just a language agnostic way of thinking about your code. We will discuss pros and cons of applying it in case of Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do anyone need this at all?
Since Python is a multi-paradigm language, what it already can provide
for FP?
Third-party libraries for FP in Python

with Python - from Model to Web-Service by Aleksei Tiulpin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will describe the basic principles of machine learning: features, cross-validation and powerful, but simple algorithm - Random Forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants will learn basic pipeline for solving a simple pattern recognition problem, tools and libraries which are nowadays used by data scientists worldwide and they will also learn how to deploy their trained prediction module as a Flask web-service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more to serialization than just JSON and Pickle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the course of this talk, beginners will learn what serialization is about and how to use it. More advanced users will learn new serialization techniques including how to work with complex object graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will go over several serializers including JSON, msgpack, CBOR and Pickle and tell about their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in Machine Learning, specifically in Deep Learning have led to a popularization of this discipline beyond research and even into mainstream media. Approaches using Deep Learning and the so-called area of Representation Learning are now being applied to various areas of science and engineering and an active open source developer community has evolved around them pushing the limits of these algorithms and making them widely available and applicable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will look at some of the latest developments using these techniques in the context of Natural Language Processing, in particular looking at the problem of text classification. A special emphasis will be placed on open source tools and libraries in Python that allow cutting edge research while allowing for fast, iterative and explorative research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author:  Clemens Westrup recently wrote his Master's Thesis on Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing in Aalto University's Machine Learning and Data Mining programme. Originally just visiting Finland for an exchange year from Germany he fell in love with the place and the people when finding fellow musicians and falling in love with the amazing Aalto Design Factory where he studied and later taught Product Development and Design Thinking. He now works as a Data Scientist at Sanoma in Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When web applications are created with development frameworks, UI element id tags are also generated. Id tags are widely considered the best way to refer to element but these new tags do not show purpose of the element. Because tags are generated, they can change without warning. That can ruin test automation business case due to laborious maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show how to write understandable and maintainable test automation scripts by finding elements based on their labels or captions. I will also tell how web applications UI should be designed to support this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author: Pekka Kiviniemi is a test automation quality consultant at Qentinel. In his recent projects he has developed test automation for web applications using Selenium and Robot Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing unit tests for algorithms and data processing pipelines poses challenges distinct from those in the web or desktop application domain. A key reason for poor unit test coverage is that writing tests is hard and laborious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll show some real-life unit test scenarios from Eniram along with tools we have developed to ease writing good tests. Many of the presented techniques also apply in other domains besides data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics will include some or all of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;short overview of NumPy and Pandas testing tools
Eniram's testing tools for
asserting vector data
enhanced parametrized tests
two-dimensional parametrized tests
asserting mixed values and exceptions
readable diffs for text block assertions
discovery of configurations and input data for running data processing tests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author: Antti Kaihola is a Python developer working in the Infrastructure team at Eniram. He's been with Python for 17 years, first for web development and scripting before moving into data processing. Building a platform for data processing using great Open Source components keeps Antti and his colleagues busy at work. At home, he occasionally spices family life with a microcontroller here and some MicroPython there, or encourages his kids to experiment with programming and robotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, millions of people use social media like Twitter or Facebook, to catch up on news and engage in discussions with other users. Our research group at Aalto University analyzes such discussions and studies how people interact on social media. Towards this end, visualization can be a very useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we use networkx, a python library, to process and visualize user interactions on Twitter. We introduce networkx with simple examples and continue with the visualization of twitter data. During the talk, we’ll see that discussions about polarized topics (e.g., elections) look quite different than non-polarised ones.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZODB is a mature and well maintained object-oriented database for transparently and persistently storing Python object trees (objects and their references). In other words, ZODB stores Python objects as they are – no object-relational mapping required. In addition to Python objects, ZODB can also store binary blobs (like images) attached to those objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give a small tutorial on getting started with ZODB with a simple command-line app written in Python 3. I cover the basic ZODB usage, testing and maintenance. Finally, I give a short overview of the ZODB ecosystem and demo of SubstanceD – a ZODB embracing web app framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author: Asko Soukka is a system designer at University of Jyväskylä and a core contributor for Plone - an open source CMS written in Python. He has have over 10 years of experience in using ZODB in CMS context with databases up to 100 GB.&lt;/p&gt;
