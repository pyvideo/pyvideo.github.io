least three separate C implementations, each with their own strengths
and weaknesses and in various states of maintenance. This presentation
will review the current state of the art and discuss the future of
crypto in Python including a new library under development, PyPy support
and more.&lt;/p&gt;

flow of learning while doing. Add that to the massive amount of bad or
outdated information on the web and many developers are lost or worse,
build insecure systems. This tutorial will introduce developers to
modern cryptography with an eye towards practical scenarios around
password management, encryption and key management.&lt;/p&gt;
