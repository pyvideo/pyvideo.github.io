&lt;p&gt;Six years ago I was happily teaching Science and a little bit of IT at
school. I had done some basic programming a long time ago but this was
mostly from magazines as a kid. Jump forward six years and I am now
leading on Computer Science at Key Stage 3 and engaging learners in
Chemistry and Physics with physical computing, digital making and
programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been an exciting journey and has transformed the way I teach
Science and developed the skills to teach Key Stage 3 Computer Science.
At the heart of this has been Python and I would love to share that
journey with you and how I brought Python into school in more than just
Computer Science lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
