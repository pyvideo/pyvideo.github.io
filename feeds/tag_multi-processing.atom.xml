to your local machine. The files are fairly small, and you can list and
access these files from the remote server through a REST API. You'd like
to download them as fast as possible. The catch? There's a billion of
them. Yes, one billion files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would would you do this? Would you do this synchronously in a single
for loop? Would you use a producer/consumer queue with threads?
Multiprocessing? Asyncio?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll examine 3 different mechanisms for concurrently
downloading files: multithreading, multiprocessing, and asyncio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of these mechanisms we'll look at design best practices, how to
handle debugging and error handling, and of course the overall
performance. By examining three different approaches using the same data
set, we gain a better understanding of the tradeoffs of each approach so
we can pick the right library for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Modern hardware is multi-core. It is crucial for Python to provide&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;high-performance parallelism. This talk will expose to both

&lt;div class="line"&gt;parallel computing with Python. The goal is to help practitioners and&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;developers to make better decisions on this matter.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I will first cover how Python can interface with parallelism, from
leveraging&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;external parallelism of C-extensions –especially the BLAS family– to
Python's&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;multiprocessing and multithreading API. I will touch upon use cases,
e.g single&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;vs multi machine, as well as and pros and cons of the various
solutions for&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;each use case. Most of these considerations will be backed by
benchmarks from&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;the scikit-learn machine&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;learning library.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;From these low-level interfaces emerged higher-level parallel
processing&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;libraries, such as concurrent.futures, joblib and loky (used by dask
and&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;scikit-learn) These libraries make it easy for Python programmers to
use safe&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;and reliable parallelism in their code. They can even work in more
exotic&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;situations, such as interactive sessions, in which Python’s native&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;multiprocessing support tends to fail. I will describe their purpose
as well as&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;the canonical use-cases they address.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The last part of this talk will focus on the most recent advances in
the Python&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;standard library, addressing one of the principal performance
bottlenecks of&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;multi-core/multi-machine processing, which is data communication. We
will&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;present a new API for shared-memory management between different
Python&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;processes, and performance improvements for the serialization of large
Python&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;objects ( PEP 574, pickle extensions). These performance improvements
will be&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;leveraged by distributed data science frameworks such as dask, ray and
pyspark.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why you might use each of them, how to go about doing so with python and
some of the pitfalls you might fall into along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, I'll give short examples in code of achieving each level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- leveraging multiple hosts using RQ, and also the possibility of RPC
with HTTP&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- multiprocessing and threading using their respective modules from
the python standard library&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- asyncio demonstrated with AIOHTTP&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds great, but there are &amp;quot;gotchas&amp;quot; you should know about before
you get started, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- multiple machines can actually be multiple virtual machines on the
same host&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- effectively communicating between processes is hard, how can we go
about making it easier?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- the limitations of threading and the GIL&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- run_in_executor - do we ever really need to use multiprocessing or
threading directly again&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- use of asyncio when dealing with both networking between hosts and
between processes - you end up using two different kinds of
concurrency at the same time. That can be confusing, but also awesome.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll finish of by showcasing a library I built, arq which is a job
queueing and RPC library for python which uses asyncio and Redis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larger datasets can't fit into RAM - suddenly you can't use Pandas any more - but we need to analyse that data! First we'll review techniques to compress our data (maybe cutting our DataFrame RAM usage in half!) so we can process more rows using regular Pandas. Next we'll look at clever ways to make common operations run faster on DataFrames including dropping down to numpy, compiling with Numba and running multi-core. Finally for still-larger datasets we'll review Dask on Pandas and the new Vaex competitor solution. You'll leave with new techniques to make your DataFrames smaller and ideas for processing your data faster.
This talk is inspired by Ian's work updating his O'Reilly book High Performance Python to the 2nd edition for 2020. With over 10 years of evolution the Pandas DataFrame library has gained a huge amount of functionality and it is used by millions of Pythonistas - but the most obvious way to solve a task isn't always the fastest or most RAM efficient. This talk will help any Pandas user (beginner or beyond) process more data faster, making them more effective at their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a data science project, one of the biggest bottlenecks (in terms of time) is the constant wait for the data processing code to finish executing. Slow code, as well as connectivity issues, affect every step of a typical data science workflow — be it for network I/O operations or computation-driven workloads. In this talk, I will be sharing about common bottlenecks in data processing within a typical data science workflow, and exploring the use of parallel and asynchronous programming using concurrent.futures module in Python to speed up your data processing pipelines so that you could focus more on getting value out of your data. Through real-life analogies, you will learn about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequential vs parallel processing,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronous vs asynchronous execution,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network I/O operations vs computation-driven workloads in a data science workflow,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When is parallelism and asynchronous programming a good idea,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to implement parallel and asynchronous programming using concurrent.futures module to speed up your data processing pipelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk assumes basic understanding of data pipelines and data science workflows. While the main target audience are data scientists and engineers building data pipelines, the talk is designed such that anyone with a basic understanding of the Python language would be able to understand the illustrated concepts and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In real-life environments, performance and delay of algorithms matter.
biped is an AI copilot that guides blind people with limited computation
capabilities. In this talk we show how we dropped computation time by a
factor of four relying on profiling, algorithmic design, multi-threading
and Cython. biped aims to bring autonomous driving capabilities to the
human level, to safely guide blind and visually impaired people in the
street. The device acquires 3D images and then detects, tracks and
predicts trajectories of all surrounding elements, before warning the
user via spatial sounds. In the process of working on this project we
realized that for most problems that we encountered there is already an
existing algorithm that roughly fits our requirements. The majority of
the existing solutions though only work well on very powerful machines
with dedicated GPUs. This is especially true for algorithms from the
domain of Computer Vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the same algorithm work on computationally limited devices, like
a Raspberry Pi, opens up a new set of interesting and non-trivial
problems. In this talk we want to explore some options to adjust new or
existing algorithms to computationally constrained environments to make
them work in the real world. We want to show some common pitfalls as
well as best practices to optimize algorithms build with Numpy, OpenCV
and Python. Furthermore we want to give a swift overview over system and
algorithmic design decisions as well as what options exist to profile
Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it easier to understand the ideas and concepts and to follow
along we will showcase some examples of our work at biped during the
presentation. By presenting some algorithms of our perception pipeline,
we can showcase some of the key aspects for the modelling and
implementation of algorithms. In particular, we present how we implement
the detection of ground in an image and how we optimized the algorithm
to go from roughly two FPS to nearly real-time. We conclude the talk
with a brief demonstration of the capabilities of our whole perception
pipeline and discuss the performance we achieved by applying the ideas
introduced in this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
