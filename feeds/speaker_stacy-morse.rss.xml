Worse, they have little to no controls aside from on/off. Most are not dimmable and changing colors requires the use of gels. In this talk I will discuss how CircuitPython was used in conjunction with LEDs and microcontrollers to make a custom LED photo lighting rig.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only can they catch bugs and errors but they can contribute in positive ways to the individual developer, the team, management and company as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art critiques have existed in academia for hundreds of years. The methodology of the critique has evolved to be time sensitive and productive, while keeping the enthusiasm of the student artist intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the art critique is to get peers and mentors to look at the work and raise any problems they may see. It's also time where people with more experience could contribute their knowledge in a helpful way. This process is about producing the best work, quickly and in a productive and constructive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These methods can be applied to code review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyCon attendees will come away from this talk with a set of methods that will enable them to preform constructive code reviews using art critique principles.&lt;/p&gt;
