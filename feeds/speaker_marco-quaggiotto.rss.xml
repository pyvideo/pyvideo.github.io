social interactions at conference gatherings by integrating data from
online social networks and from wearable proximity sensors. The pipeline
that processes the stream of sensor data and provides proximity-based
services is implemented in Python and Twisted, and has been demonstrated
to scale to thousands of simultaneous users.&lt;/p&gt;
