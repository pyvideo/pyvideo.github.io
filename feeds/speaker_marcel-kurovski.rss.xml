&lt;p&gt;Personalized Playlist Recommendations on Spotify are great – some of them let us discover new songs, some others help us to rediscover songs. However, rediscovery seems to be limited on the more recent past, i.e. going only a month backwards. This is a problem if you like to rediscover some of your favorite songs you might have listened to a longer while ago. Sometimes we add them to our &amp;quot;&amp;quot;liked songs&amp;quot;&amp;quot; where they likely fade away. However, you once explicitly declared those tracks as favorites. So, what is it that we can do about this missing piece in personalized playlist recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the first thing we do is to request our personal usage data from Spotify according to GDPR. Second, we analyze and enrich it with track audio features offered by Spotify’s rich Web API. We derive the music taste profile of ourselves from 12 months of streaming history and use this taste profile to retrieve favorite songs we haven’t listened to for more than a year. In my talk, I present you the Python package I build for this purpose, possible extensions and enable you to create your own personalized playlist to rediscover your past!&lt;/p&gt;

achieved widespread adoption. Two of them are TensorFlow and PyTorch.
Where PyTorch relies on a dynamic computation graph TensorFlow goes for
a static graph. Where TensorFlow shows greater adoption and additional
useful extensions with TensorFlow Serving and TensorBoard, Pytorch
proves useful trough its easy and more pythonic API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data scientists are confronted with explorative challenges, but also
need to be aware of model deployment and production. Do we need to
single out frameworks until we end up with the only one or is there a
case for joint usage of two deep learning frameworks? Can we leverage
the strengths of the frameworks for different tasks along the path from
exploration to production?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I want to present a case combining the benefits of PyTorch
and TensorFlow using the first for explorative and latter for deployment
tasks. Therefore, I will choose a common deep learning challenge and
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of both frameworks along a demo
that brings a model from development into production.&lt;/p&gt;
