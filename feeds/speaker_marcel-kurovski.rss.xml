achieved widespread adoption. Two of them are TensorFlow and PyTorch.
Where PyTorch relies on a dynamic computation graph TensorFlow goes for
a static graph. Where TensorFlow shows greater adoption and additional
useful extensions with TensorFlow Serving and TensorBoard, Pytorch
proves useful trough its easy and more pythonic API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data scientists are confronted with explorative challenges, but also
need to be aware of model deployment and production. Do we need to
single out frameworks until we end up with the only one or is there a
case for joint usage of two deep learning frameworks? Can we leverage
the strengths of the frameworks for different tasks along the path from
exploration to production?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I want to present a case combining the benefits of PyTorch
and TensorFlow using the first for explorative and latter for deployment
tasks. Therefore, I will choose a common deep learning challenge and
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of both frameworks along a demo
that brings a model from development into production.&lt;/p&gt;
