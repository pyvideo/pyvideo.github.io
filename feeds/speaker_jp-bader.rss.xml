in the same sentance. Player Pianos that are 100+ years old are awesome
artisan artifacts, but they don't play digital formats very well. This
talk will show how we take a 100+ year old technology and marry it to
the digital age via Python libraries and precision lasers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this discussion we will cover how we are creating our own
&amp;quot;Plug-n-Stream Player Piano&amp;quot;. We will take a look at the different
digital signal processing Python libraries, their functionality, and
requirements for converting audio streams to piano playable audio files.
After a brief walk through of our prototyped hardware, we will dissect
the digital signal processing, converting streaming music to data for
the Player Piano. With a real Player Piano in the room we will demo
streaming music from our devices onto the piano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LIVE(ish) Piano Playing!&lt;/p&gt;
