You should! But donâ€™t know where to start? In this talk, we'll break down the barriers building your own robotic project using MicroPython and microprocessors. You'll learn what a robot is, why building one is fun (maybe even useful), and how to get started with the essential components. We'll cover microprocessors as the &amp;quot;brain&amp;quot; of your robot, LEDs for visual feedback, actuators for adding movement, and sensors for touch and light.
Whether you're a complete beginner or have dabbled in electronics before, this talk will equip you with the knowledge to start building your own robotic projects.&lt;/p&gt;
