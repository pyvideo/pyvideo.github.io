&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will briefly introduce the problem of genomics and existing home-grown efforts to bring &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot; technology to solve genomics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's amazing that our genome so completely and uniquely encodes each of us with a simple 4-protein code, like a file. More amazingly, we're so similar that we can build a reference map of human genomes and reason about commonalities. Genomics has taken off in the last two decades driven largely by advances in computing; the work of mapping the genome is incredibly data and compute intensive. This talk will briefly introduce the problem of genomics and existing home-grown efforts to bring &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot; technology to solve it. It will compare these with the separate rise of technologies like Apache Hadoop and Spark, and how these ideas are helping genomics scale up even further.&lt;/p&gt;
