&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London Python Code Dojo is a community organised monthly meeting for
Python programmers in the UK. Variously described as social coding,
developer training, &amp;quot;Scrapheap Challenge&amp;quot; for Pythonistas and &amp;quot;I didn't
learn coding like this when I was a lad&amp;quot;, we've forked the traditional
code-dojo format and turned it into something very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain and explore what happens in the dojo, how it's
organised and why various changes were made to the classic dojo format.
Reference will also be made to influences from music education and
philosophy of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, by the end of the talk you'll all want to go organise a dojo!&lt;/p&gt;

Return of Peer to Peer Computing&amp;quot;. He described how developers, in light
of the Snowden surveillance revelations, ought to learn about and build
decentralized peer-to-peer systems with strong cryptography. This talk
introduces, describes and demonstrates ideas, concepts and code that a
group of Pythonistas have been working on since Holger's keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked ourselves two questions: what are the fundamental elements /
abstractions of a peer-to-peer application and, given a reasonable
answer to the first question, what can we build? We will present work
done so far, discuss the sorts of application that might be written and
explore how peer-to-peer technology could be both attractive and viable
from an economic point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces, describes and demonstrates concepts and code
created during sprints and via online collaboration by a distributed
group of Pythonistas under the working title p4p2p (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://p4p2p.net"&gt;http://p4p2p.net&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We asked ourselves, as frameworks such as Zope/Plone, Django, Pyramid or
Flask are to web development what would the equivalent sort of framework
look like for peer-to-peer application development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've tackled several different technical issues: remote execution of
code among peers, distributed hash tables as a mechanism for peer
discovery and data storage, various cryptographic requirements and the
nuts and bolts of punching holes in firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work is ongoing (we have another sprint at the end of March) and the
final content of the talk will depend on progress made. However, we
expect to touch upon the following (subject to the caveat above):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the problem we're trying to solve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why P2P?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The story of how we ended up asking the questions outlined in the
abstract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we've done to address these questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exploration of the sorts of application that could be built using
P2P.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A call for helpers and collaboration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy to answer any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces the asyncio module. I'll cover what it's for, how
it works and describe how I used it to write a real-world networked
application (a distributed hash table). We'll explore the event loop,
coroutines, futures and networking with examples from my code. This
won't be an exhaustive exposition. Rather, attendees will grasp enough
of asyncio to continue with their own studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this introductory talk I hope attendees will want to
learn more about asyncio and perhaps give it a try in their own
projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BBC micro:bit is a small programmable device for children. A
million of them have been handed out to the UK's 11 and 12 years olds.
The Python Software Foundation was a partner in this moon-shot scheme
and, thanks to the efforts of Damien George, MicroPython runs on the
device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk will tell the story of the project, describe Python's role in
it and explain how the wider Python community can become involved. It
may involve demonstrations, live coding and audience participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best aspects of any conference, and EuroPython in particular, is the corridor track. It's when you walk around the physical conference venue and bump into an old buddy, find yourself striking up a conversation with a friendly co-attendee in the coffee queue, or join a huddle of welcoming folks discussing something interesting. The corridor track is where the community comes alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we remotely recreate the opportunity for chance encounters, unexpected conversation and exploration of a venue and new city with friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have a template for a solution: MUDs (multi-user dungeons/dimensions), back in the day, were hugely popular virtual worlds of text. I asked myself, &amp;quot;what would a MUD written in 2020 look like?&amp;quot;. Then, rather foolishly, &amp;quot;how hard can this be?&amp;quot;. Happily, I'd written a MUD in Python as a recent entry to PyWeek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk describes how I initially created, extended and then refined my very own MUD, written in Python using asyncio, structlog, sly, redis and other fun technology. What's more, this MUD is special because it's a programmable MUD: it's really a multi-user development platform for on-the-fly coding of interactive virtual worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could possibly go wrong..? Let's find out..!&lt;/p&gt;

Invent with PyScript by Nicholas Tollervey, Joshua Lowe
https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/invent-with-pyscript

_[PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) is a platform for Python in the browser_, enabled by [web-assembly](https://webassembly.org/). It brings the rich ecosystems of [CPython](https://python.org/) and [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) to the web. _[Invent](https://invent-framework.github.io/) is a PyScript based app creation framework with complementary browser based tooling_ and is designed to be easy to learn and use, no matter if you're a beginner or expert.

This talk introduces Invent, explains how it was built on top of PyScript and describes the design and architecture decisions made to ensure Python and the browser complement each other. Invent apps work anywhere a browser works and by the end of this presentation you'll be armed with all you need to know to build, deploy and extend native Python based applications running atop PyScript on all manner of platforms (mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop, [web-enabled fridge](https://www.standard.co.uk/shopping/esbest/home-garden/kitchen-appliances/best-smart-fridges-b1002542.html), [car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkhbN9B9bbs), point of sale terminal... you name it, so long as there's a browser!).

This talk will be fast-paced, technical, creative, full of possibilities, may include geese 🪿, _and will be a lot of geeky fun_. 

By the end you'll ask yourself, "I wonder what I can invent?" and go create cool stuff in minutes.

the UK. Why? Because it is through education and learning that we engage
with our future colleagues, friends and supporters. It's how we develop
and progress as a community. A community involves both formal and
informal organisations, expectations of behaviour and processes for
making collective decisions. In other words, it's a political exercise.
Organising education to promote and sustain our community is also a
political exercise: it reflects a certain point of view about how our
community should be. In the UK there are several Python community based
projects that reflect our shared outlook that our community should be a
diverse, collaborative and friendly place. With all this in mind, I will
tell the story of one of these educational projects: the BBC micro:bit ~
a device for beginner programmers that runs MicroPython (a million of
which have been given to the UK's 11-12 year olds).&lt;/p&gt;
