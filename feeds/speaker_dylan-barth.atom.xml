can break large, multi-step data processing task into a graph of
smaller sub-tasks that are aware of the state of their
interdependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth Intelligence tracks the performance and activity of all the
companies in the UK economy using their data ‘footprint’. This involves
tracking numerous unstructured data points from multiple sources in a
variety of formats and transforming them into a standardised feature set
we can use for building predictive models for our clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, this data was collected by in a somewhat haphazard fashion:
combining manual effort, ad hoc scripting and processing which was
difficult to maintain. In order to streamline the data flows, we’re
using an open-source Python framework from Spotify called Luigi. Luigi
was created for managing task dependencies, monitoring the progress of
the data pipeline and providing frameworks for common batch processing
tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
