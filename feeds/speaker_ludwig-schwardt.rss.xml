environment and how we believe Python can contribute, particularly when
it comes to the trade off between development time and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors: Simon Ratcliffe SKA South Africa, Ludwig Schwardt SKA South
Africa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track: Astronomy and Astrophysics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Square Kilometer Array will be one of the prime scientific data
generates in the next few decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction is scheduled to commence in late 2016 and last for the best
part of a decade. Current estimates put data volume generation near 1
Exabyte per day with 2-3 ExaFLOPs of processing required to handle this
data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a host country, South Africa is constructing a large precursor
telescope known as MeerKAT. Once complete this will be the most
sensitive telescope of it's kind in the world - until dwarfed by the
SKA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make extensive use of Python from the entire Monitor and Control
system through to data handling and processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk looks at our current usage of Python, and our desire to see
the entire high performance processing chain being able to call itself
Pythonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss some of the challenges specific to the radio astronomy
environment and how we believe Python can contribute, particularly when
it comes to the trade off between development time and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
