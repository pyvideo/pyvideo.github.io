know where to begin, or you may have started as you had time - and
wished to go further. This talk is a guide about where some have gone,
and where you might want to go with AI in python. But it is not the last
stop. This talk is designed to be a stating guide to move from hobbyist
level AI learning to more production-ready coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often where you begin is with some of the low-code GUI tools - for
instance Flowise [ flowiseai.com] - where with a api key and some clicks
you can quickly build a chatbot - and then you leant to add complexity -
maybe you pull out some embeddable code -or start to have more than one
agent talk to each other, or with some walk-throughs you build a
knowledge-base of documents for your bot ( a RAG - Retrieval Augmented
Generation ) and now it knows - all your recipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later you want to give your bot some &amp;quot;hands&amp;quot; or rather tools and later
you connect to N8N [n8n.io] - which is a flexible workflow automation.
You've made your bot reach out into the world to do something (aka made
it &amp;quot;Agentic&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then you want more control - and stability - so you look to do what
you previously did in low-code- directly in python, with a view to
production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when you look to the &amp;quot;Lang&amp;quot; flavor tools: Langchain, Langflow,
Langraph, and Langsmith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the time, this will be a very quick tour of these concepts with
both images and code shown - so it won't be a line-by line build along.
A repo and suggested resources will be provided at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
