Moreover Python's high-level syntax and relatively lightweight Python VM accelerate development process, reduce size of project code, speed up testing and bug-fixing and so on. All the features highly decrease cost of development and allow small teams to write a complex application that works on all the major desktop platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this sounds great but as usual in practice there are a lot of technical issues in this approach. This presentation is dedicated how to avoid potential architectural problems in multi platform development and reach project goals without serious troubles. We will overview major widgetsets and will try finding a silver bullet for multi platform desktop development.&lt;/p&gt;
