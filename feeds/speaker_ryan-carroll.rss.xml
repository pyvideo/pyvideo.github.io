using affordable and accessible technology. In this talk, you'll learn
how to build an IoT system from off-the-shelf components, collect data
from sensors, and visualize the data to tell compelling stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;In this talk I'll showcase a project where I used a Raspberry Pi,
environmental sensor, and Python to measure and monitor noise levels.
This project demonstrates how to design and implement an IoT solution
from concept to deployment, including using InfluxDB and Grafana for
real-time data visualization, all running in Docker.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;By the end of this talk, you'll have the skills to bring various
pieces of technology together to solve real-world problems. Whether
you're an enthusiast, developer, or researcher, this session will
inspire you to apply open-source tools and inexpensive hardware in
innovative ways to address the challenges in your every day life.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
