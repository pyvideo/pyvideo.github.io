I hope that with these insights and consideration of how a modern (i.e., depending on some autograd system) probabilistic libraries is designed, it could help user and practitioner to write better probabilistic programs.&lt;/p&gt;

In TFP land, effectiveness usually comes from writing model that could generate batch-able functions, and utilizing modern hardware (GPU, TPU) with compiler accelerator (i.e., XLA). I will give a walkthrough on how to do so and highlight some gotchas.&lt;/p&gt;

In this
tutorial, we will learn about what is the likelihood function and how do
we use it for inference. Using PyMC3, I will demonstrate how to get the
likelihood from a model, how does it connect to inference using NUTS or
Variational approximation, and some practical usage of the model
likelihood to perform model comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
