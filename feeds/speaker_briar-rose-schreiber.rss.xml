&lt;p&gt;Visual Novels are a large range of games originally from Japan, called otome. These games have grown in popularity and are available on pretty much every platform. Some popular titles include Long Live the Queen and Choice of Robots. We will be using visual novel creator Ren'Py to make our own visual novel games on desktop and mobile platforms. Everyone interested in creative mediums at any skill level will be able to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
