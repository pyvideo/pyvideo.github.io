in it. In a fast paced live demo, I will code a small system and deploy
it without touching the keyboard. I hope to convince you that voice
recognition is no longer a crutch for the disabled or limited to plain
prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I developed a case of Emacs Pinkie (RSI) so severe my
hands went numb and I could no longer type or work. Desperate, I tried
voice recognition. At first programming with it was painfully slow but,
as I couldn’t type, I persevered. After several months of vocab tweaking
and duct-tape coding in Python and Emacs Lisp, I had a system that
enabled me to code faster and more efficiently by voice than I ever had
by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a fast-paced live demo, I will create a small system using Python,
plus a few other languages for good measure, and deploy it without
touching the keyboard. The demo gods will make a scheduled appearance. I
hope to convince you that voice recognition is no longer a crutch for
the disabled or limited to plain prose. It’s now a highly effective tool
that could benefit all programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
