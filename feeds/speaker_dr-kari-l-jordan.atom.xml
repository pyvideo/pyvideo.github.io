who participates and on learning outcomes. This presentation covers
trends in computational teaching, and focuses on how these trends relate
to diversity, inclusion, equity, and access to computational training.
Through the lens of The Carpentries, an organization dedicated to
teaching foundational coding and data science skills worldwide, we
present best practices and opportunities for improvement in
computational teaching pedagogy. Evidence-based teaching practices,
“train-the-trainer” programs, and mentoring are three strategies we
outline that support inclusive pedagogy in computational teaching. We
describe and discuss effective teaching practices that promote inclusive
pedagogy in computational teaching, including formative assessment,
collaborative note taking, a strong commitment to a Code of Conduct, and
creating a welcoming environment for learners.&lt;/p&gt;
