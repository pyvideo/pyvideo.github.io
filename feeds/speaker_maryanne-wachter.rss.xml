Writing A Custom Constraint Solver for Blender with Cython</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2022/will-it-blend-writing-a-custom-constraint-solver-for-blender-with-cython.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to prove Python naysayers wrong in that you can have both fast and approachable code with Python? With a few adjustments to standard Python code, you can harness the power of Cython to vastly improve Python performance, while maintaining the look and feel of a traditional Python package. In this talk, common pitfalls in developing with Cython will be discussed in the context of how Cython was used to bring powerful and fast optimization algorithms to a custom geometric form finding add-on for Blender.&lt;/p&gt;

Cython's capabilities permit users to use Python-like syntax to integrate with existing C code and build their own library and program interfaces accessible from both C and Python. This talk will cover essential tools and workflows for building with Cython and what the interface looks like for integrating with legacy C code, and how to build and package a Cython extension with Poetry and uv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, utilizing the full powers of Cython is not without its own set of challenges. The presentation will also provide practical insights into common errors encountered during build and runtime phases while developing in Cython. Attendees will learn how to navigate these issues, using a detailed account of the specific obstacles faced when wrapping a legacy C library for Python via Cython. We will discuss different memory management and debugging tools, with a focus on Valgrind, and how to utilize these tools during development in Cython.&lt;/p&gt;
