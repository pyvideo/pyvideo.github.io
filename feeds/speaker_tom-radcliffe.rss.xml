&lt;p&gt;Many companies implementing Machine Learning (ML) have learned that noise and other errors in the data set can cause stability issues resulting in time loss and headache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robust algorithms are under-appreciated, particularly by people new to data analysis. This talk will review the basic idea of robust or non-parametric algorithms and look at some of the more important named algorithms, as well as looking at how to apply the philosophy of robustness to any problem.&lt;/p&gt;
