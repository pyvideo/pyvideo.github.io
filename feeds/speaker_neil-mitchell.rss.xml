&lt;p&gt;At Meta, we're dedicated to advancing the Python ecosystem through open-source contributions and community engagement. Our mission is to improve the tooling and runtime, making the language more efficient, scalable, and accessible for developers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing Pyrefly: A Scalable Type Checker for a Unified IDE Experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're excited to introduce Pyrefly, a new type checker designed with scalability in mind. Built from the ground up using Rust, Pyrefly provides a faster and more efficient type checking experience, enabling developers to write better code with confidence. With Pyrefly, we aim to deliver a unified IDE experience power type hints and code navigation on a new type checking engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlocking Better Performance with Free-Threaded Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the Python community, we've been working on making free-threaded Python (No-GIL) available in Python 3.13. This significant milestone allows developers to take full advantage of modern multi-core processors directly from Python. More recently, our efforts have focused on improving the single-threaded performance of the free threading build, ensuring that Python remains a top choice for developers seeking high-performance capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
