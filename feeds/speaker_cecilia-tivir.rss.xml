as being exclusively for boys. Social norms do not teach women to choose
coding or others ICT areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing Django Girls Workshop to Maputo was meant to teach girls more
than how to code and create amazing blogs, we also wanted to use it as a
platform to create opportunities that would empower them and promoting
the diversity in technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we have started to hold small and informal meetings to teach girls
and boys how to program in python. Some of the girls who have
participated in Django Girls Maputo workshops have continued to learn
more and develop their skills. We hope to have more girls learn how to
code in python so they can also share their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our talk will cover the importance of how bringing Django Girls
community to our girls in Mozambique and how powerful it was, is and it
will be to bring them to demonstrate their abilities, skills and belief
in their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message we intend to cover to the audience is that Django Girls is
not only for a some women, but it's for all women that we can reach, so
that we can encouraging more women to strive for programming careers
benefits the tech community at large and also is a way to give them
tools and show them the way that they can empower themselves and
contribute in technological development, so that better the societies
they are situated in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most amazing feedbacks that we got was: &amp;quot;In this event it is
possible to realize that anyone is capable of developing technological
tools. Django Girls has come to say that women are capable of
programming, coding and creating technological solutions&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
