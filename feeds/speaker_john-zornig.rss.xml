It powers courses on edx.org
and those of the many adopters of the Open edX platform. Open edX is a
complex platform with many interconnected parts, but the largest
components are Python Django apps. This presentation will describe the
experiences of developers at The University of Queensland's UQx project
from 2013 when UQ joined the edX consortium through to the present and
the future. Your presenters are John Zornig, Director UQx (former Senior
Architect) and Andrew Dekker Senior Developer.&lt;/p&gt;
