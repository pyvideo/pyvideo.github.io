performs operations on the host that require root superpowers. Following
best-practice design, most of the code runs as an unprivileged user and
only the code that needs additional powers runs as root using a tool
called &amp;quot;rootwrap&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk discusses the evolution that led to the current rootwrap
design, why it has proven to be completely inadequate in practice, and
presents a new &amp;quot;privsep&amp;quot; alternative currently being worked on within
Oslo.&lt;/p&gt;
