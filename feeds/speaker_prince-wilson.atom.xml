integrated in practically every discipline involving software
engineering. When new resources come out for us to develop better or
faster we tend to forget that we build products for people who aren’t
like us or who aren’t in situations like us. This is especially true of
the web. In this talk, we will discuss how to increase our web apps
accessibility through handy techniques and tools and how you can make
use of the features of web frameworks like Flask or Django to make
anyone coming to our spot on the Internet a bit more pleasant for
everyone without it costing much more time.&lt;/p&gt;
