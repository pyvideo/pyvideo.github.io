I learned
about coding by watching my dad and asking questions. To me coding is
like a “sport” and I think lots of kids would like to code if they had a
chance to learn and build things. I’d like to tell you how I got
started, and show some of the projects I’ve built. Then you can have
ideas on how to help other kids get started.&lt;/p&gt;
