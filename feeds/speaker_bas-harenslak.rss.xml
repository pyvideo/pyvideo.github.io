loosing. So he wanted to train a bot to play on his behalf. This is our
story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re using AWS Lambda to get better at a card game named SushiGO. We
make a small genetic algorithm in Python that uses AWS Lambda as a
backend. The talk consists of these parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick Explanation of the rules of the SushiGo Card Game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translation of real life to an algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain why this problem needs a lot of CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain why AWS Lambda fits the simulation use-case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to quickly hack Concurrency in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to deploy lambda very quickly with chalice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimentation Results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss an algorithm that we’ve tried to improve in three
ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying simple maths to make the search algorithm better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throwing lots (lots!) of CPU’s against the problem by leveraging AWS
Lambda and python concurrency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will conclude by discussing whether or not AWS Lambda is suitable for
a gridsearch/grid simulation (hint, it’s not meant for this task, but it
actually kind of works very well).&lt;/p&gt;
