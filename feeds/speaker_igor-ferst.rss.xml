optimization problems related to scheduling, resource allocation,
vehicle routing, and many other areas. This talk will give a brief
introduction to ILP and show how to solve a real-world vehicle routing
problem using Google's open-source python library for ILP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do airlines choose which planes service which routes? How does a
hospital optimize the shift schedule for hundreds of doctors and nurses?
How do you choose the optimal location for a group of fulfillment
centers, or oil derricks, or cell towers? These kinds of problems (and
many others!) can be solved with integer linear programming (ILP), a
powerful and decades-old framework for solving optimization problems. In
this talk we will give a brief introduction to ILP and describe it's
uses, strengths, and weaknesses. We will also show how to solve a
real-world vehicle routing problem using Google's open-source python
library for ILP. Trigger warning: this talk will contain high-school
level math.&lt;/p&gt;
