A tourist guide application.

&lt;p&gt;OpenCV Python bindings provide several ready to use tools for camera
calibration, image recognition and camera position estimation. This
talk will show how to recognize a picture, from a library of known
paintings, and compute the camera position with respect to the
recognized picture using OpenCV and numpy. This is applied to a
tourist guide application for Google Glass through the recognition of
the paintings exposed in the museum.&lt;/p&gt;
