civic tech to make government more accountable and transparent. From a
single Drupal site, to an organization powered by Django, weâ€™ll tell the
story of how a Python web framework built a successful nonprofit. The
history of our open source Django apps tell the story of a growing
organization and an open government movement. We'll cover various Django
apps we have published and how each reflected the state of our
organization, the open government community, or Django at the time they
were created.&lt;/p&gt;
