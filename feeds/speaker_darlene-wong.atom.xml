&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Pytest is a widely-used, full-featured Python testing tool that helps you write better programs. Whether you have been using Pytest for years or are just getting started, you may find features of Pytest that you would like to modify or customize for your own environment or specific use cases. Did you know that you can easily enhance and customize Pytest through the use of plugins? In this talk, you will learn all about some of the useful Pytest plugins that are available, and learn how to create your own plugins. We will walk through the plugin creation process by creating a plugin to upload Pytest reports to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Data is the new bacon. For all industries, including health, security, entertainment, etc., it is impossible for anyone to store and analyze data without using an automated platform. A unified platform is needed to provide data visualization and extract intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elasticsearch is a distributed, real-time, search and analytics platform. With the help of a restful API, Elasticsearch saves data and auto indexes the parsed data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our talk, we will walk attendees through configuring the ELK stack and visualize datasets on Kibana.&lt;/p&gt;
