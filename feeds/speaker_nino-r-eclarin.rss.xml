&lt;p&gt;Data science and software engineering is getting more and more intertwined with each other. But what is the common grounds between the two? How do we define the boundaries of the two disciplines? This talk will discuss the role of python in terms of development process for software engineers working in a data science environment. We will also tackle the different aspects of software engineering in relation to working with a data science oriented team.&lt;/p&gt;
