Leveraging a network of wireless sensors to facilitate decision making with real-time data does sound awesome, but how do I get started? In this talk we’ll examine the wireless sensor network my team created for office automation in a 24 hour company sponsored hackathon. Along the way you’ll learn how to connect real sensors to the NodeMCU IoT platform, transmit information over a network using the MQTT messaging protocol, aggregate data with a Dockerized Python microservice, and display it in real-time with various Python packages. By the end of the talk you’ll be ready to set up a sensor network of your own for some home or office automation!&lt;/p&gt;
