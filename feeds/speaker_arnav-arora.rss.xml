Each
language has so many nuances to it and we've barely scratched the
surface in trying to understand how we came about learning them. In the
talk, I'll be briefly discussing the importance of language in our
society, how it helps us become a sort of a hive mind to learn from each
other. I'll show the progress we've made in text generation and the
various techniques that have proven to be successful so far (bow,
embeddings, language models). Lastly, I'll be showing some recent
advances in unsupervised transfer learning in NLP (ULMFiT, ELMo) with a
practical implementation of a pretrained model learning to write like
Shakespeare using his texts. Will end the talk with possible areas to
explore in the field. The code will be in the form of a Jupyter
notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
