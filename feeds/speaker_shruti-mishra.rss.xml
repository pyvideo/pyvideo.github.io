&lt;p&gt;The proposed project is both a web and a mobile application. The web application makes use of the Django framework for its structure and backend. The mobile application uses Flutter, which is a cross-platform for both iOS and Android. The basis of the application would mainly be concerned as use for Educational Institutes.
The application also projects an important feature, that is, Smart Attendance System. The proposed system keeps track of attendance using barcodes. It uses openCV to scan the barcodes. System stores student attendance details and generates a brief report for the administrator. The libraries used for the project are: openpyxl, cv2, pyzbar, xlsxwriter.&lt;/p&gt;
