Quickly groking and working with deeply nested collections like combinations of dicts and lists (and sometimes other types too) is a common problem, whether it's trying to understand a data set, an API response, or detailed instructions or results from infrastructure as code. Let's talk about current solutions to the problem, their limitations, and how to make that all even easier. Let's talk about making a DeepCollection that can handle anything.

Do you ever look at your software systems and workflows holistically? Do you ever wonder what could be achieved through smarter designs and dedicated effort? When you design your applications, do you consider developer efficiency and satisfaction as much as end-user experience? Python offers the simplicity and flexibility to achieve both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will explore a journey from supporting disjointed components and addressing ad hoc business requests to developing a technical vision and creating an elegant solution that both serves business needs and offers developers a pleasant support experience. I will also highlight the design thinking approach, software architecture “-ilities” concepts, and the decision process that took place during this project.

Software supply chain security is increasingly important to the open-source ecosystem, but the learning curve can be steep. Certificate authorities, transparency logs, keys, signing… and even keyless signing! What do these terms all mean and how can a Python developer incorporate tools that make their projects more secure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide a high-level overview of the developer-first open-source project, Sigstore, within the Python context. We’ll go through each component of Sigstore, including how to sign a software artifact with Cosign, how Fulcio issues certificates, and finally how developers and end users alike can verify claims made on the Rekor public ledger. We’ll discuss how PyPI is leveraging Sigstore to help with verifying and trusting dependencies we all rely on. Finally, we’ll go through a demonstration of creating, publishing and signing a containerized Python app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience will walk away with an understanding of how they can navigate software security more effectively and be better citizens of open source by implementing recommended security practices.

Healthcare organizations generate and store vast amounts of data, but accessing and utilizing this data can be a challenge. One solution to this problem is FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), a standard for exchanging electronic health information. In this talk, we will explore the basics of FHIR and its data model, as well as how to use Python to interact with FHIR servers and manipulate FHIR data. We will also discuss real-world examples of how FHIR and Python are being used in the healthcare industry to improve patient care and drive innovation. Attendees will come away with a solid understanding of FHIR and Python, and be equipped to start using these technologies to unlock the power of their own health data.

Public Cloud is often touted as a cheaper option, but the bills we get in the mail can be long and convoluted. For better or worse, any dollar spent in the cloud is a result of an architecture decision. This talk will give attendees a firm understanding of the relationship between the architecture and the invoice and the key metrics to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will cover:
What is FinOps and why is it important
Key metrics for measuring Cloud spend
Automating Cloud Invoices
Using Python, a SQL database, and FaaS, we can build a pipeline that automatically retrieves our invoice, and populates a searchable table to derive insights such as our top 5 most used services and biggest growing services. Attendees with small developers account to large multi-account deployments will better understand the impact of their architecture on their wallet.

He’s the author of both the old PyEphem astronomy library as well its modern alternative Skyfield, along with smaller projects like the elegant little logging_tree module that’s compatible with every Python back to Python 2.3. He is a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation, on whose behalf he served as the volunteer chair of PyCon 2016–2017 in Portland.&lt;/p&gt;

Looking at open-source security concerns from a socio-technical perspective is currently underexplored. In this talk, we will learn about analyzing such risks by looking at governance structures, pull requests, and GitHub configurations in open-source 3D printer projects and the overall top Python repositories.

Do you find it harder to work with parts of your project? Do you shy away from working with aspects of your code? When showing people what you're working on, do you feel the need to explain why it got that way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our projects grow, they usually become harder to maintain. This happens when we focus too much on adding new features. As a result, our code becomes hard to change or understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will give you a tool you can use to unwind that code, making it easier to change and understand, not to mention giving you more satisfaction.
Speaker: Chris May&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris May is a co-founder of the Python user group in Richmond, Virginia, PyRVA, and had a great career in web and python development, most recently as a Senior Full-Stack Engineer at Markel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing his impact on his coworkers and PyRVA members, Chris decided to step away from his full-time job to teach python to others through group training, coaching, and authoring resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his infectious zest for life and Python, Chris is excited to help you become a better Python developer.&lt;/p&gt;

As real-time event streaming has become a necessity in many organizations, a plethora of libraries, frameworks, and applications have arisen to help meet that need. These different tools each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and you may end up deciding to use one or more of them, but many problems can be solved with a simpler approach.

When it comes to machine learning projects, verifying and trusting model performance results is a particularly grueling challenge. This talk will explore both how we can use Python to instill confidence in model metrics and the best way to keep models versioned to increase transparency and accessibility across the team. The tactics demonstrated will help developers save precious development time and increase transparency by incorporating metric tracking early on.
