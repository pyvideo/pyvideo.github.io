anyone access to free SSL certificates that could be automatically
fetched and renewed. The demand was massive, and so was the need for a
client to fetch these certificates for all of those users. This client
is called Certbot, and it's written entirely in Python. Unfortunately
for the sanity of Certbot developers, these users of Let's Encrypt can't
decide on a single operating system to use! This requires us to ship our
software, and all of its dependencies, to a variety of systems all with
different web servers, Python versions, package managers,and underlying
packages. Learn how we got through this mess!&lt;/p&gt;
