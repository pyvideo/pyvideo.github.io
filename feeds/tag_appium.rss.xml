Testing manually is nearly impossible.
Thatâ€™s where automated testing shines. Just sit back and watch the machine go!
Python is a very powerful language for writing automated tests, but since Python is not installed on mobile platforms, we need to find a way to remotely control and monitor the device.
But how do we automate a device remotely? The answer is Appium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will go over the process of deploying and testing iOS (or Android) applications, and how to work with Appium to easily generate Python 3 code for testing your application.&lt;/p&gt;
