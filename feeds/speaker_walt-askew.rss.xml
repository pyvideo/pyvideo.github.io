We
investigate the controlled performance decrease of our public sentiment
models under transformations that reduce the number of features in the
dataset. This feature reduction speeds up our real-time data science
tools and helps to counter the curse of dimensionality. We outline the
Python workflow that both produces and validates the quality of these
transformations at scale in the AWS ecosystem, and we detail our
programming and design choices, touching on the scikit-learn API,
configuration versus code, SQL templatization, and our open source API
client.Presenter(s): Speaker: Walt Askew, Civis Analytics&lt;/p&gt;
