ever-wider audience of users with a variety of backgrounds and
experience levels, it is more critical than ever that its documentation
better serve the needs of its diverse array of readers. We formally
introduce the Python Docs Community—the self-organized, Python Steering
Council-endorsed collective working toward this goal—and provide a look
at the major user-facing improvements implemented, underway and coming
soon for the core documentation, devguide, PEPs and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we'll share the key insights and lessons learned from our
ongoing projects, and how they can help &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; improve the documentation
of your own projects. And if this sounds like something you might want
to be a part of, we'll share how you can engage with us and your fellow
documentarians through our community platforms and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
