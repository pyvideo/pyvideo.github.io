Where's the data?</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/chipy/there-were-986-roadway-fatalities-in-illinois-in.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seen on garish LED roadway signs all around Chicago on New Year's Eve,
2013: 986 TRAFFIC DEATHS IN 2013. It leads to many questions: On what
roads? When did the accidents happen? What do we do now? I'm scared to
drive. I will talk about purging my fears by finding the data to answer
some of those questions. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tothebeat.github.io/fatal-car-crashes/"&gt;http://tothebeat.github.io/fatal-car-crashes/&lt;/a&gt;
This talk will involve PythonAnywhere, IPython, a module that's not even
on PyPi (dbfpy), searching for and finding open government data,
CartoDB, Google Fusion Tables, csv, and maybe Pandas. Rest assured,
there will be no graphic photos.&lt;/p&gt;
