PyTorch is ideally suited for this task, first because running solvers on GPUs results in a significant speed-up, and second because numerous tasks related to the calibration and control of quantum systems require the computation of gradients based on the time-evolved quantum state. The emerging research effort to develop quantum computers heavily relies on such tools. The dynamiqs library (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dynamiqs/dynamiqs"&gt;https://github.com/dynamiqs/dynamiqs&lt;/a&gt;) is a Python library powered by PyTorch, designed to address this challenge. It provides differentiable solvers for the &lt;em&gt;Schrödinger Equation&lt;/em&gt; which governs closed quantum systems, the &lt;em&gt;Lindblad Master Equation&lt;/em&gt; for open quantum systems and the &lt;em&gt;Stochastic Master Equation&lt;/em&gt; for continuously measured quantum systems. Gradients can be computed with PyTorch’s automatic differentiation, or using a constant memory cost method. The library is being developed by several PhD students in physics, most of whom have substantial experience in software development.&lt;/p&gt;
