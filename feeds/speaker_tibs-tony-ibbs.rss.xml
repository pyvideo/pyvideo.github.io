&lt;p&gt;I recently had to learn about Redis for work, and was very pleased at
how well designed it is, and how much fun it is to use. Several times I
went to look for a piece of functionality, and there it was, doing
exactly what I wanted. I am especially fond of BRPOPLPUSH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose to give a brief introduction to what Redis is and does, an
overview of the redis-py client and fakeredis for unit testing, and if
there's time, some discussion of asyncio programming using aioredis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, I hope that the audience will know a bit about a genuinely
useful tool that can be used as a datestore, and also for
cross-communication between many programming languages. And maybe
they'll share some of my enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
