&lt;p&gt;Design is 95% typography … or something like that. Having a grasp on what makes for pleasant, easy to read typography that reinforces your brand is the first step towards building an amazing, impactful experience. Together we will explore typography fundamentals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sizing, spacing, and rhythm to make all of our type feel cohesive.
How to improve readability and encourage the user to read.
Type families and different styles.
Choosing and pairing fonts, how many to use, and when to use them.
Much more!
These typography basics will help you better understand why some typefaces just don’t work and give you some go-to solutions for when the designer is out sick (or has gone crazy). We’ll learn a bunch but not too much, it will be just enough :grin:&lt;/p&gt;
