Identifying these bottlenecks can be a daunting task. Well, not anymore, we now have tools to easily identify these bottlenecks. In this talk we will talk about it all: the why, what and how to do profiling and benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will look at &lt;cite&gt;django-silk&lt;/cite&gt; for profiling while for benchmarking we will be using the ever reliable &lt;cite&gt;pytest-benchmark&lt;/cite&gt;. We will cover the basics and slowly move into seeing things like the actual raw query buried which is buried in Django. Lastly l will share tips on how to avoid over running your services while try to optimise. This talk is suitable for intermediate to senior developers, however junior developers can also benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
