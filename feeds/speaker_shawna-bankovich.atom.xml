never pass the experiment phase. So often we pour endless time and money
building models to help us make predictions about the world, but even
top performing models cannot deliver on their intended purpose if they
are not able to efficiently run in their intended environment. Machine
Learning Operations (MLOps) strives for automation and monitoring at all
steps of ML system development and construction so projects have a
greater chance of becoming operationalized. With MLOps we have the
opportunity to apply traditional DevOps principles that have transformed
the world of software delivery, like unification of system development
and operations, to machine learning. This talk will cover the principles
of MLOps and outline the path to making ML in production a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
