The open source Tomviz project was developed to address these challenges, managing a complex series of steps going from raw data to reconstructed visualizations using a reproducible data pipeline. Tomviz recently made its 1.0 release, collaboratively developed by Kitware and Cornell. It offers a cross-platform desktop application, leveraging Python, SciPy, and NumPy coupled with the powerful ParaView, VTK and ITK projects to offer a specialized interface for materials scientists. The pipeline offers Python data operators that can be edited in the interface, saved, rerun, and edited further to process, visualize and export data with a view of the 3D tomographic data.&lt;/p&gt;
