Join me as we discuss what IT leaders and members can do to help broaden the DEI space by bringing in members outside their network. I'll highlight our organization - Indy Women in Tech - and others groups working to bring in more women, LGBTQ, Bootcamp participants, community college grads, and people of color into the tech workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2021.pythonwebconf.com"&gt;https://2021.pythonwebconf.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
