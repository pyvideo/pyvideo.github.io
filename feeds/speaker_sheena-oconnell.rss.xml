- our mission
- how we ran as an on-premises training provider
- the utter chaos of our transition to remote (there were about 250 sim cards registered on our MD's name. Lol)
- how we prioritised what we built
- how we ended up choosing Django
- high level view of how we train different kinds of coders
- where we are heading&lt;/p&gt;

Teaching is an amazing thing, you can change a person's life just by spending some time with them, having conversations, showing them stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's normal for people with software development skills to take on teaching roles - this might be through formal or informal workplace mentorship, community involvement, through being hired to teach or any number of other situations. Teaching and sharing knowledge is often a part of the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software development and teaching are two distinct skill sets. There is a science to teaching and learning - there is a robust body of knowledge, there are techniques, mindsets and patterns that make teaching effective. And, on the flip side, there are mistakes, anti-patterns and myths that are very much worth avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's perfectly normal for software developers to take on teaching roles and responsibilities, but it's exceedingly rare for software developers to receive any training in how to teach well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been working in alternative education for&amp;nbsp;quite some time, I've learned a lot of lessons along the way. In this talk, I'll share some of the most impactful lessons I've learned.&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of people would reach for heavy frontend tools and frameworks such as React, Vue or one of their many, many competitors. And those tools generally have their recommendations around testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are shifting a bit - tools like HTMX and AlpineJS are taking Python Web dev by storm and simplifying the creation of modern frontends. A Python web app can now take on the full responsibility of producing a modern frontend. So it would be good to test them in Python as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Playwright comes in. It promises to enable reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps. And it has Python bindings. &lt;em&gt;swoon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll give you a little tour of Playwright and how to use it in your app. I'll demo some workflows, patterns, tips, and tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
