This presents a number of different challenges to workflows that were often traditionally designed to work in memory. We explore useful primitives in dask and explain how these can be used to aid analyis. Using these primitives, we show users how common image processing functions can be built in this framework and point out their implementations in the dask-image library.&lt;/p&gt;
