each day. There are lots of Python tools for processing this data:
Analytics, statistics, visualization, natural language processing,
machine learning, etc. But recent experiments have demonstrated that
there are untapped opportunities for innovation in new methods of
providing users quick access to these disparate data sources,
transforming that data, and streaming it into the wealth of existing
Python tools. This talk will discuss some of those opportunities and
demonstrate related, lesser-known, yet valuable community- based Python
tools that have just recently emerged and are now available for free.&lt;/p&gt;
