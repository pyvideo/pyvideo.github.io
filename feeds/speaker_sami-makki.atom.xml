But containers are not made for developers, and it's only been recently
that some features, such as the multi-stage dockerfiles, were introduced
for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we were a small team, we couldn't maintain both Dockerfiles for
development and production. That's why we developed our own scripts to
template them. Today, those are no longer scripts, but a plain
OpenSource Software that can help all developers stopping getting crazy
while maintaining a ton of dockerfiles... without boilerplate !&lt;/p&gt;
