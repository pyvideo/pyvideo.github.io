Often these non-functional requirements seem abstract and are not described well enough for those of us that donâ€™t have an appsec background to fully understand why they are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go over several of the most common practices to best containerize Python applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show examples of how your application can be exploited in a container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and most importantly, how to easily spot issues and fix your Dockerfiles and deployment manifests before you commit your code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
