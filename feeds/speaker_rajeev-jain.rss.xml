UXarray offers support for loading and representing unstructured grids by utilizing existing Xarray functionality paired with new routines that are specifically written for operating on unstructured grids. In this talk, we will present the current capabilities of the library: reading and writing of unstructured grids, reading of datasets along with basic grid operations and the need to speed up computations, integration operations along with details on speedups obtained by using Numba and python indexing. We will also demonstrate the use of this library for visualization of unstructured grids.&lt;/p&gt;
