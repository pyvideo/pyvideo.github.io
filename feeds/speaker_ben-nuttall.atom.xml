schools revolution by providing affordable open and connectable hardware
to people of all levels of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have an education team, we're pushing forward with creating
resources and training teachers to help deliver modern computing
education around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All our learning resources are Creative Commons licensed and available
on GitHub. We write materials that match the UK computing curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm Ben, from Raspberry Pi. I do development and outreach for the
Foundation and I work with the rest of the education team to help make
learning through computer science, coding and hardware hacking more
accessible to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I explain the Raspberry Pi story: its mission - the reason
the Pi exists; what happened before release - getting the board in to
production; what happened in the first two years - the community birth
and growth; and what's coming next - education focus, new hardware and
improved software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is the main language used (and advocated by us) in education with
Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're creating learning resources to match up with the new UK computing
curriculum, where we teach young people programming and computer science
concepts with Python on Pi, and help teachers deliver quality material
in the classroom to work towards the objectives the curriculum sets out
to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Raspberry Pi we open up possibilities for connecting to the real
world in an accessible way using the powerful, high level and human
read/write -able language of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work closely with the community: hobbyists organising Raspberry Jam
events; educators teaching with Raspberry Pi; the software communities
and their contributions - and we welcome any interested parties to get
involved with helping us provide for the wider community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Raspberry Pi, it's easy to do physical computing directly
from Python code - rather than usual embedded hardware engineering in

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll show examples of physical computing projects that
use Python on Raspberry Pi and demonstrate the sort of code  used in
such projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical computing with Python is very popular in education - as it's
so engaging, and more interesting than printing to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be an informative session with learning possibilities to
give those new to physical computing a change to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

to design science experiments using the available sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission Zero is a low-barrier challenge where students can run a 1
minute Python program in space to display a message to the astronauts.
They have access to the sensors for conditional logic but cannot record
data or take photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission Space Lab is a more involved challenge, including planning an
experiment, writing and testing code which will run for 3 hours in
space, either studying life in space or life on earth (which includes
taking photos of Earth out of the ISS window). MSL teams get to keep the
data and photo they record in their experiment and are to write a report
analysing their findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small tech team at the Raspberry Pi Foundation maintain the operating
system used in flight and work in collaboration with ESA and partners to
keep the operation of the Pis running smoothly on the ISS LAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as sharing details of the OS maintenance and devops for the
Astro Pis, I'll share photos taken from space and show findings from
student experiments using opencv, tensorflow, scikit-learn, ephem and
more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wealth of amazing tools freely available to open source software developers to use to maintain their projects. Practically every problem we face or are likely to face in software development has been lived through and solved many times over. Patterns emerge for dealing with development practises and we build our software using the tools made by the previous generation of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're very fortunate to operate in an amazing open source ecosystem where we've learned we're stronger when we build on each other's foundations. We're constantly laying new foundations for ourselves and we share our ways of working with the world. We now have a very sophisticated set of tools for developing, managing, testing and documenting our new projects without reinventing the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we don't discover all the tools at once - we pick them up as we go along, as we find uses for them and we hear about them. I'm going to share a range of great tools I use to maintain some popular open source Python projects, and explain how the difference they've made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software packaging and distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Licensing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git &amp;amp; GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributor community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project management tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk demonstrates examples for development of Python projects on Linux, but the tools can be used cross-language and cross-platform.&lt;/p&gt;

[Online]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Ben Nuttall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In BBC News Labs, we're always looking for ways to innovate without requiring production teams to change their workflows. We investigated ways we could enrich our digital output by extracting detailed information about the contents of our TV and radio programmes from their running orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many traditional broadcasters, the BBC uses the MOS Protocol for communications between newsroom computers and servers where media files such as audio and video are stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production teams create running orders using enterprise broadcasting tools, and every time they add details or make changes, XML messages are emitted by the newsroom computer systems. We've created a way to process these messages to build up a machine-readable version of the running order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed a general solution for dealing with MOS messages - a Python library called mosromgr (MOS running order manager). It's based on open standards and could be useful to other broadcasting organisations, so we've released it under an open source licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This library was developed by the BBC News Labs team as part of a series of projects based around extracting information from running orders from the BBC's TV and radio programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to share the detail of our innovation projects investigating personalisation, automatic chapterisation and live notifications, and showcases our Python library and AWS pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Liffey B on 2022-07-15]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBC News Labs is an innovation team within BBC R&amp;amp;D, working with journalists and production teams to build prototypes to demonstrate and trial new ideas for ways to help journalists or bring new experiences to audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work in short project cycles to research and build prototypes. We have worked with the BBC's flagship radio news programme production team to enrich programme timelines with metadata to provide enhanced experiences to the audience. We are currently working with local radio teams around the UK to provide the means to capture highlights in live radio for re-use and for social media, reducing the workload for producers, and getting more mileage from linear broadcast programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in short cycles, it's important for us to be able to quickly build processing pipelines connected to BBC services, test and iterate on ideas and demonstrate working prototypes. We make use of modern cloud technologies to accelerate delivery and reduce friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will share our ways of working, our ideation and research methods, and the tools we use to be able to build, deploy and iterate quickly, the BBC's cloud deployment platform, and our use of serverless AWS services such as Lambda, Step Functions and Serverless Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Python on the Raspberry Pi, it's easy to start creating physical computing projects, and to experiment and tinker with add-ons and accessories from lights and buzzers to environmental sensors and robotics. This ease of access was accelerated with the creation of a new minimal boilerplate library called GPIO Zero, of which I am the primary author. In this talk I'll talk about the Foundation's work in education, share some great Pi projects, give a taster of how to get started in physical computing and dive into the technical innards of the GPIO Zero library. As well as a learning tool, the Pi is commonly used in home automation projects and industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I’ll show examples of computing projects that use Python on
the Raspberry Pi and demonstrate the sort of code used in such projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be an informative session with learning possibilities to give
those new to Python on the Raspberry Pi a chance to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

It solves the problem that &amp;quot;pip install&amp;quot; can take a long time to build packages implemented in C. Wheels are a general solution to this problem, but PyPI does not currently allow maintainers to upload ARM platform wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote some tooling for automating the building of all 115,000+ packages on PyPI, including all version releases, which totals up to over 750,000 package builds, monitoring the build status and logging the output.in a database, and providing the wheels in a pip-compatible web server. Raspberry Pi users can now &amp;quot;pip install&amp;quot; from this server (a Raspberry Pi) and get pre-built Python wheels, which take just seconds to install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first build run I completed was on a Raspberry Pi in my living room: I built the latest version of every package (110k). Then, in order to build all versions of all packages (750k), I moved the project to a cluster of 20 Raspberry Pis in a data centre.&lt;/p&gt;

learn to prototype ideas and move on to declaring interaction between
more advanced devices in the home and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These options for device programming, along with the extensibility of
the library, provide the means to program complex behaviour using simple
Pythonic code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BBC News Labs is an innovation team within BBC R&amp;amp;D, working with journalists and production teams to build prototypes to demonstrate and trial new ideas for ways to help journalists or bring new experiences to audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work in short project cycles to research and build prototypes. We have worked with the BBC's flagship radio news programme production team to enrich programme timelines with metadata to provide enhanced experiences to the audience. We are currently working with local radio teams around the UK to provide the means to capture highlights in live radio for re-use and for social media, reducing the workload for producers, and getting more mileage from linear broadcast programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in short cycles, it's important for us to be able to quickly build processing pipelines connected to BBC services, test and iterate on ideas and demonstrate working prototypes. We make use of modern cloud technologies to accelerate delivery and reduce friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will share our ways of working, our ideation and research methods, and the tools we use to be able to build, deploy and iterate quickly, the BBC's cloud deployment platform, and our use of serverless AWS services such as Lambda, Step Functions and Serverless Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In BBC News Labs, we work closely with journalists and we try to come up with innovative approaches to meeting their needs - either to improve or automate internal processes or to enhance the audience experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An idea was born from discussions with a BBC News editor to add markers to indicate to users where the big important moments are on the news channel. We built a minimum viable product, and extended the reach of the prototype over the next few months. We launched our first audience facing trial on news live pages, and then it was used on Eurovision, Springwatch, Glastonbury and Wimbledon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was built using AWS lambda functions (Python), FastAPI and postgres, a React / TypeScript frontend and an iPlayer plugin (also TypeScript).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover our rapid prototyping process, the tech stack used, as well as how we managed to deliver a production audience-facing project - and where we go from here.&lt;/p&gt;
