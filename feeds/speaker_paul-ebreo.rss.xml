We'll delve into the concept of consciousness as a combination of memory, prediction, and experience. By using hierarchical probabilities, similar to Google's PageRank algorithm, we can build AI systems that are not only powerful but also understandable and aligned with human values. Python will be our toolset as we explore the exciting future of AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

most fundamental apsects of our lives? From the food we eat, to the
houses we live in, this project wants to open source the tools we use to
obtain what we need to live. Come to the ChiPy meeting to find out the
name of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
