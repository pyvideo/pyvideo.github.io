software engineer as disparate roles. Like DevOps has merged operations
and development, DataDevOps will consume data science.” - Philip Winder,
an engineer and consultant at Container Solutions &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://container"&gt;http://container&lt;/a&gt;-
solutions.com/tensorflow-on-kubernetes-kubeflow/ You've created and
tuned a machine learning model, using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or
scikit-learn - now what? How can you ensure that the model is deployed
to your DevOps team as production-ready code, and can scale as needed on
incoming data? How can you seamlessly migrate a model from your local
laptop / virtual machine to a hosted server on your cloud platform of
choice? This talk walks through the architecture of Kubeflow: a project
dedicated to answering those questions - and to making machine learning
on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. We will describe, in
detail, the three components of the project: * a JupyterHub platform
for creating and managing Jupyter notebook servers that are used by data
science and research groups; * a Tensorflow Customer Resource for
managing compute resources to a specific cluster size; and * a
Tensorflow Serving container to house the machine learning work. By the
end of this talk, you will have a firm understanding of why Kubernetes
would be useful to machine learning engineers, and how you can deploy
it, today, to support your predictive models.

Paige’s education was focused on the earth sciences (geophysics, carbonate geology) and computer science (data analytics); and her previous work experience was geared toward drilling and completions optimization, data science, and geophysical plug-in development for the energy industry. When Paige is not sitting in front of glowing rectangular screens at work, she absolutely adores hiking / kayaking / mountain-biking around Texas’ glorious Green Belt; resuscitating Apple ][s; and (poorly!) attempting to play bass guitar.

application that's great for data exploration, manipulation, and
cartographic preparation -- in other words, it's software that allows
you to make detailed, aesthetically-pleasing maps for free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QGIS is also &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; script-able with Python, and integrates with a
large number of database and analysis backends (GRASS, R, PostGIS,
etc.). In this talk, Paige Bailey will be giving a short overview of
QGIS; detailing a few mapping case studies; then showing how to leverage
additional functionality by writing custom Python plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

through Zed Shaw's &amp;quot;Learn Python the Hard Way&amp;quot;; and now you're itching
to see what Python can help you do. This is the workshop for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the breakdown: we're going to be taking you on a whirlwind tour
of Python's capabilities. By the end of the workshop, you should be able
to easily follow any of the widely available Python courses on the
internet, and have a grasp on some of the more complex aspects of the
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don't forget to bring your personal laptop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience: This course is aimed at those who already have some basic
programming experience, either in Python or in another high level
programming language (such as C/C++, Fortran, Java, Ruby, Perl, or
Visual Basic). If you're an absolute beginner -- new to Python, and new
to programming in general -- make sure to check out the &amp;quot;Python 101&amp;quot;
workshop!&lt;/p&gt;
