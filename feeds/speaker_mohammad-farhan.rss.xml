&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on PyRF, an open-source library developed by ThinkRF, and how it has been used to provide the same functionality in terms of instrumentation control, data acquisition, digital signal processing, automated testing, production testing, as well as application development.&lt;/p&gt;
