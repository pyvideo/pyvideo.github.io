Load Testing</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-cz-2016/dos-yourself-aka-load-testing.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my talk I'd like to tell you about testing performance of your
backend applications. I'll explain what load testing is in theory and
how to do it in practise. I'd like to focus on why load testing is
important step in software development and what will most likely
happen when it's forgotten. I'll walk through different tools that
can be used, starting with very basic AB, via jMeter up to the Locust
and cloud-based services.&lt;/p&gt;
