&lt;p&gt;The recent explosion of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto currencies has presented a fantastic opportunity for the small amateur trader. In August 2015, 1 Bitcoin could be bought for $200 and 2 years later as I type this sentence the price has increased to $4211. This talk will explain WHY crypto currencies in particularly are so profitable, and HOW we can take advantage of the situation using Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I had no understanding of altcoins or the block chain and had never invested or traded any money in my life. This changed very recently when I set myself the challenge of turning my Raspberry Pi into a profitable trading bot. During some initial research I stumbled upon the world of crypto currency trading and was completely hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested to hear about my experience (and find out whether I've actually made any money) then please come along. No knowledge of trading, bitcoin or anything particularly technical is required.&lt;/p&gt;
