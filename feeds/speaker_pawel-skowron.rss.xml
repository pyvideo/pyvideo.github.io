Prelegent/Speaker: Pawel Skowron&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many good things have been said about open source and they are true. However, this beautiful rose also has its thorns. Within Intel Poland, we have recently founded a new team of python developers with a mission to contribute to OpenStack, one of the largest open source projects in the world. We would like to share our experience of an amazing adventure we had while working on the Glance Metadata Definitions Catalog, a cross project feature. It was a unique opportunity to observe how proprietary and open source development worlds collide. The presentation will differ from so many talks about open source contribution in the way we promise to talk about both the beauty and the thorns.&lt;/p&gt;
