which has been internally evolved for ten years to annotate mammalian,
bacterial, and viral genomes at the protein level. Everything we built
is coded in Python: the machine-learning annotation engine, the
middleware and the data visualization interface. A software that would
have been extremely difficult to create, for a tiny shop as BioDec,
without leveraging the language itself and projects such as BioPython,
Scipy, Plone, and Web2py. We will try to distill some of the lessons
that we learned from more than ten years of experience dealing with
machine-learning-intensive applications and large data sets with
open-source software and Python.&lt;/p&gt;
