It does what it does best&amp;quot; I heard these words from a colleague of mine a while ago. And I couldn't agree more. Flask is great. It's my to go to web framework when developing web applications. It doesn't pack too much but it's easily scalable. Let's be honest though, aren't there times where you just thought &amp;quot;if only it could do this..&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I wish it supported ...&amp;quot;? For this session, we are going to go through Flask's testing support feature. We are going to see what it offers out of the box. We are going to cover some of it's downsides. Finally, we are going to cover a couple of enhancements one can add to make testing smoother and more fun :)&lt;/p&gt;
