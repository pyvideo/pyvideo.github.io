with NLTK and Dumbo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented by Nitin Madnani (University of Maryland, College Park); Dr.
Jimmy J Lin (University of Maryland)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A practical look at NLTK and Dumbo, python-powered and open-source
toolkits and APIs for processing natural language on a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people like us who make a living trying to make a computer
&amp;quot;understand&amp;quot; human language, Python is a very powerful language, given
its rapid prototyping abilities, native unicode support and a stellar
standard library. This relationship has been strengthened further by an
open-source, python- based Natural Language ToolKit
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nltk.org/"&gt;www.nltk.org&lt;/a&gt;) which is being widely used in
the community for both teaching and research purposes and gaining
traction in the general Python community as well
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nltk.org/book"&gt;www.nltk.org/book&lt;/a&gt;). Recently, the Python
community has seen the release of Dumbo
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumbo"&gt;http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumb
o&lt;/a&gt;), an open-source,
python-based cloud-computing API (based on Hadoop) via the hands of
Klaas Bosteels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we show how the amalgamation of Python, NLTK and Dumbo can
allow for very large-scale natural language processing efficiently and
elegantly.&lt;/p&gt;
