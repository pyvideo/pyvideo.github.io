I will touch on many aspects of the data science pipeline from data cleansing to building predictive data products at scale.
I will start gently with pandas and dataframes and then discuss some machine learning techniques like kmeans and random forests in scikitlearn and then introduce Spark for doing it at scale.
I will focus more on the use cases rather than detailed implementation.
The talk will be informed by my experience and focus on user behaviour in games and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
