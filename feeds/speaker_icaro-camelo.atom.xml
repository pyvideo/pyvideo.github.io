We need rapid provisioning of network services to virtual machines in a data center environment and improve network visibility and reduced operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software-Defined Networking is a way to start building a more open and dynamic network. It means a network can ramp up or ramp down network resources and adapt to sharp, unpredictable spikes in demand much easier than traditional networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement SDN, we use Opendaylight and Mininet (a python library) to rapidly prototype our network and create proof of concepts capable of being demonstrated and proved easily.&lt;/p&gt;
