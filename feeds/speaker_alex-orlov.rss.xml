Do you suffer from CPU bottlenecks
that slow down your growth? There's a tool that can easily fix all that,
and then some. C++ knowledge not required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come learn how Instagram, the world's largest Django deployment with
more than 600M active users, saved ~30% of global CPU by rewriting a
handful of modules on the critical path in Cython. Learn to apply those
techniques to your own projects with little effort and stop worrying
about switching to other programming languages or rewriting stable
components in C++.&lt;/p&gt;
