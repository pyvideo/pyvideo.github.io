tools and frameworks available. However, Jumo's customer base typically
doesn't have access to data or sophisticated smart phones. Instead, the
customer journey is implemented using USSD with out-of-band
communications by SMS. Building a USSD framework to run as part of our
application rather than having to add the operational complexity of
another service was an obvious solution. Python was a great fit for this
work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be a developer’s look at how Jumo implemented a highly
flexible USSD/SMS system with Python, built tools within our system to
manage the complexity of multiple products in multiple markets and
scaled up the system to many tens of thousands of transactions per day.
We will focus on how Python’s strengths fit well with the needs of
text-based mobile messaging, what techniques are used to build it for
scale, and how tooling was constructed to deal with the complexity of
multiple user journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
