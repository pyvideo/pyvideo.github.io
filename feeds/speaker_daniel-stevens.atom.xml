Come with me on a journey and learn how Atlassian went from the traditional &amp;amp;quot;Technical Writing&amp;amp;quot; team, to the Information Experience team. What began as a simple challenge to the Atlassian Technical Writing team, to make quality and success measurable and repeatable, grew into a journey to create a &amp;amp;quot;cradle to grave&amp;amp;quot; Information Experience. And we&amp;amp;#39;re just getting started. During the last two Write the Docs I&amp;amp;#39;ve given a lightning talk, Write Measure Repeat, which covers one very small part of the change we&amp;amp;#39;ve undergone. This year I&amp;amp;#39;d like to tell the rest of a story, which is some of the most exciting work I&amp;amp;#39;ve done in my career. I&amp;amp;#39;ll talk about the process of creating and growing a writing culture which is technically accurate, writes with a human voice, and connects to every other part of the information experience. While talking everyone through the journey I&amp;amp;#39;ll be sure to cover specific examples of using content strategy, user research, data analytics and a touch of team process. All this with a bit of humor and a passion which is obvious to anyone who&amp;amp;#39;s ever met me.
Main points I&amp;amp;#39;ll touch on:
How we worked through resistance to change.
What Information Experience means to us and why it&amp;amp;#39;s not just a fancy title.
Moving from the Quality Assistance team to the Design team win&amp;amp;#39;s, frustrations, hopes.
Building a better site with Confluence and considering/using other tools. Light on the tools part here, just covering the visual change and referencing how we did the actual tooling changes.
What this means to me and what I hope we&amp;amp;#39;re beginning to see in the tech comm world.&lt;/p&gt;
