one excels, why NoSQL isn't always best, and the best ways to integrate
them into your Django project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few years we've seen an explosion in the number of
production- ready databases available for web applications. From
relational to document- oriented, key-value and more, there's a
staggering array of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers the various basic types of database now available, and
highlights their weaknesses, their strengths, and the features you just
can't get from traditional databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, after a short rant about the term &amp;quot;NoSQL&amp;quot;, learn how to best
integrate them into your Django projects, why being schemaless isn't as
good as it looks at first, and how relational databases are keeping up
with the times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is currently at a crossroads: Python 2 has taken it from a quiet
word- of-mouth language to primetime, with many companies around the
world using it and an ever-increasing global marketshare of the
programming world. But now comes Python 3, the first version of the
language that is not backwards compatible with previous releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Are all my Python programs going to break? Will I
have to rewrite everything? How much time do I have? When is Python 2
going to be EOL'd? Is the language undergoing a complete rewrite and
will I even recognize it? What are the changes between Python 2 and 3
anyway? Also, the next generation is already here, as Python 3 is over
two years old now. What has been ported so far, and what is its current
status? Are migration plans or transition tools available? If I want to
start learning Python, should I do Python 2 or Python 3? Are all Python
2 books obsolete?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will attempt to answer all of these questions and more. Join us!&lt;/p&gt;

Often you need to
pull apart perfectly good HTML just to spend time painstakingly putting
back together again and converting hundreds of pages of content is a
chore. Recently PretaWeb used tools to drastically simplify this process
when converting genetics.edu.au to Plone 4.1. Diazo is a platform
independent theming engine that leaves HTML untouched. Funnelweb is a
static content migration tool for crawling and manipulating site
content.&lt;/p&gt;
