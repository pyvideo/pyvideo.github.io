We have come a long way since that announcement, with a lot new features, case studies and debugging tools for using dynamic shapes. This talk will dive into all of the new developments for dynamic shapes in PT2, arguably one of the most new and unusual features of the PT2 compiler stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data-dependent shapes are ubiquitous whenever you want to take advantage of sparsity in your data representation, whether it is in recommendation systems, mixture of experts or other use cases. We have made a lot of improvements to torch.compile's support for capturing and compiling data dependent shapes, but they also require some user knowledge to work with effectively. This talk will give an overview of PT2's facilities for data dependent compute and how to use them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
