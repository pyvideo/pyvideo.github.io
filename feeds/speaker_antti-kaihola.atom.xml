&lt;p&gt;Writing unit tests for algorithms and data processing pipelines poses challenges distinct from those in the web or desktop application domain. A key reason for poor unit test coverage is that writing tests is hard and laborious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll show some real-life unit test scenarios from Eniram along with tools we have developed to ease writing good tests. Many of the presented techniques also apply in other domains besides data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics will include some or all of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;short overview of NumPy and Pandas testing tools
Eniram's testing tools for
asserting vector data
enhanced parametrized tests
two-dimensional parametrized tests
asserting mixed values and exceptions
readable diffs for text block assertions
discovery of configurations and input data for running data processing tests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author: Antti Kaihola is a Python developer working in the Infrastructure team at Eniram. He's been with Python for 17 years, first for web development and scripting before moving into data processing. Building a platform for data processing using great Open Source components keeps Antti and his colleagues busy at work. At home, he occasionally spices family life with a microcontroller here and some MicroPython there, or encourages his kids to experiment with programming and robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
