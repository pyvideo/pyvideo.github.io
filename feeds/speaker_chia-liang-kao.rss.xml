&lt;p&gt;Day 2, 10:35-11:20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupyter has become a critical component of the machine learning life cycle. However scaled enterprise deployments and making the Data Science Experience frictionless remain challenging. We address a few common issues with PrimeHub, an open-source enterprise offering based on JupyterHub, with the capability to work with popular ML tooling like mlflow, labelstudio, and streamlit. This talk also investigates the MLOps trends adjacent to the Jupyter ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is intended for audience interested in larger scale Jupyter environment deployment in their organisation, particularly for machine learning applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PrimeHub is an open-source enterprise offering based on JupyterHub, which also allows orchestrating tools like mlflow, labelstudio, and streamlit, to assemble your own end-to-end ML toolbox for your team. We address a few common hurdles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;advanced resource scheduling for heterogenous GPU clusters
multi-tenancy and project isolations
customizable and consistent ML environments per project
managing jupyterlab extensions for teams
hybrid development environment such as vscode and ssh within notebook instances
authorization and data access management
usage reporting: allocation and utilization
We also investigate a few trends adjacent to the day-to-day jupyter environment used by data scientists and data engineers, where the roles become more cross functional in the age of MLOps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with job schedulers from within Notebook
Managing ML model deployments, CI/CD integration
Model monitoring and retraining&lt;/p&gt;
