It would be irresponsible to ignore the needs of all our users when developing our code, but isn't this just something for people who wrote client side code to worry about?  In this talk, I'll explain the basics of accessibility and how you can advocate for it across the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to find a solution. So I made a Python app that connects with the Google Calendar API, gets all the events in a period and posts the costs of each event to Slack. A following poll asks if it was worth the costs. I would like to describe how it was made and how we can make meetings valuable and engaging, instead of boring wastes of time.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will show different methods for determining what the code is doing. We'll start with the lowly print statement and introduce advanced forms of logging. We'll also cover several Python debuggers and talk about best practices for debugging and preventing bugs in Python code.&lt;/p&gt;

When I had 40,000 PDFs and needed to extract their data, I knew that the &amp;quot;lazy&amp;quot; approach was insufficient. This talk reviews tools to tame PDFs with confidence. I'll use my open-data project's workflow as an example (ETL anyone?).

When this happens, teams are often confronted with two options: sampling techniques or porting to Apache Spark. Both have significant drawbacks. In this talk, I'll demonstrate how to leverage Dask and Scikit-learn to solve this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

Protocol buffers are a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. This talk will include a demonstration of using protobuf with Python to communicate with an embedded, processing- and memory-restricted device.&lt;/p&gt;

Your unit tests pass. You have some end to end tests that cover most of the user facing features. You merge in your code and after a smooth deployment, all hell breaks loose. The microservice that the other team was developing doesn't understand what your new patch is sending as a response! What went wrong? This is a quick talk about contract based testing.&lt;/p&gt;

We'll discuss details of wrapping a minimal REST API around scikit-learn, training and persisting models in batch, and logging decisions, then compare to some other common approaches to productionizing models.&lt;/p&gt;

In MY Python?</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pyohio-2017/multimethods-in-my-python.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A benefit of using a dynamically typed language like Python is the ability to create a function that can operate on arguments of unknown types. Unfortunately, this freedom can lead to a common antipattern where the function is responsible for type-cheaking each argument before operating accordingly. This talk will explore avoiding this antipattern with multimethods.&lt;/p&gt;

You expect to be able to put data into your database, have it to stay there, and get it out when you query it... hopefully in a performant manner. We'll go from basics to the more advanced of what you need to know to keep things running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

But spreadsheet applications aren't always the best tool for processing that data. I'll show you how to use OpenPyXL to work with that data in a way that's better than using .csv files. I'll also discuss common problems faced when working with spreadsheets via code. &amp;quot;State of the art&amp;quot; moves fast here, thus the title.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's review the recent history of PyPI, lessons learned, and techniques applied to keep it running.&lt;/p&gt;

Subtests, added in Python3.4, make accomplishing each of these three goals easier. This talk goes through some examples of how subtests make testing 1) more readable, 2) more thorough, and 3) more DRY. The result: better apps and fewer bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, though, teaching is hard! For many, going beyond the show-and-tell we do with coworkers is just too intimidating. Let me teach you tips, tricks,  and tools I've collected over years of teaching Python to thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;
