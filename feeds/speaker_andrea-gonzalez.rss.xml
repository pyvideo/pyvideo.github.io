expected to find so many programmers. Even more unexpected was a small
group of Python/Django developers I found, passionate about kickstarting
the Python community in Baja California. As Django Girls (and later,
Django Girls Ensenada) came and went, I learned more about the Django
community in other cities of Mexico, including the reason why I never
heard of them before organizing the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
