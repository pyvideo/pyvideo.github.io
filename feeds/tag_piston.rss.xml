framework, is that it doesn't make writing REST APIs easy enough. In
fact the paradigm for a typical Django application involves views which
map to HTML page templates. With end users increasingly expecting rich
interfaces with the responsiveness of a desktop application, this
paradigm is being superseded. Fortunately a third-party Django
application called Piston fills the gap. Django/Piston can be combined
with the Ext JS JavaScript framework and widget set to create
attractive, responsive Web applications, and this talk will show you
how.&lt;/p&gt;
