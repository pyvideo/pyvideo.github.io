In my talk, I will present usage examples including advanced queries,
transactions, and backend switching. We will look at differences
between Peewee and SQLAlchemy, see how Peewee takes advantage of
operators to build SELECT queries, learn how to integrate Peewee into
a Flask-based application, and cover the most common difficulties
when trying to extend Peewee.&lt;/p&gt;
