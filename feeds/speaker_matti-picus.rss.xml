been operating with dedicated funding. NumPy developers think it has
invigorated the project and its community. But is that true, and how can
we know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;We will give an overview of the actions weâ€™ve taken, both successful
and unsuccessful, to improve sustainability of the NumPy project and
its community. We will draw some lessons from a first year of
grant-funded activity, discuss key obstacles faced, attempt to
quantify what we need to operate sustainably, and present a vision for
the project and how we plan to realize it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Topics we will cover include the following:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Invigorating the community - what did we do, and are we correct in
our opinion that it invigorated the community?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- doing things in the open as much as possible&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- creating a roadmap&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- NumPy Enhancement Proposal process&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- commit rights&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- in-person meetings&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measuring community/project health. We will use a number of published
or proposed metrics to quantify this. Which ones do we think
accurately represent the state of the project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lessons from the first grant and introducing paid work into a
previously fully volunteer-driven project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the best profile for a salaried employee?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From inside or outside?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have we succeeded in encouragin diversity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A vision for future sustainabity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Models for obtaining and funneling funding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, and for the first time since its creation, NumPy has
been operating with dedicated funding. NumPy developers think it has
invigorated the project and its community. But is that true, and how can

We are expanding our support for the python capi, can support much of the numpy python interface, and should have released a Python 3.3 compatible version by the time Pycon Israel happens Attendees of the talk can see a full demo of PyPy on Windows, including installation of Numpy and running some scientific benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
