It is designed to maximize the trial-and-error speed with its Define-by-Run paradigm, which provides Pythonic programming of auto-differentiated neural networks. The framework can accelerate performance with multiple GPUs in distributed environments and add-on packages enable quickly jumping into specific domains. In this talk, we introduce the abstract of Chainerâ€™s API, its capabilities for accelerating the deep learning research and applications, and the future direction of the framework development.&lt;/p&gt;
