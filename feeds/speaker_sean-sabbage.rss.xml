&lt;p&gt;Whenever multiple people are working on the same thing, there is a need
to communicate. But how can you be sure that the thing that you're
thinking about is the same thing that everyone is is thinking about? Are
you sure that your idea of a web page with a simple form on it is the
same as your colleague's idea of a web page with a simple form on it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your team needs a shared understanding, and this talk aims to explore
what that means, why it's important, and equip attendees with some tools
to help them reach it.&lt;/p&gt;
