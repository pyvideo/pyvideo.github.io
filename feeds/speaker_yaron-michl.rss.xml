This talk will cover working with satellite data in python in serval tool rasterio that is based on the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) and NumPy and combine it with xarray a python model to working with Multidimensional Arrays. we will show example that make use of the Unique information in Earth imaging satellites like the Ability to get information about vegetation health by using data in wavelengths the human eye can't see. This talk is intended for novice and intermediate python developers who interested in using satellite imagery&lt;/p&gt;
