and touted as an easy language to learn for experienced developers. Its
self proclaimed virtues of beauty, explicitness, simplicity and
readability certainly should make it newbie and user-friendly... and
mostly do. I'd like to talk with other Pythonistas about the parts that
suck and what we can do to fix them!&lt;/p&gt;
