&lt;p&gt;Presented by Rob Ludwick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, C is the preferred language for low level network
programming and works well for those who have the time and patience to
work with it. As it turns out, Python is very capable for prototyping
low level network code, collecting data, and testing ideas quickly
without getting lost in the land of C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not as robust as C, Python provides a simple and elegant solution
for many cases to either prove a theory or gather data before developing
a more robust solution. Obscure topics such as raw sockets, multicast,
network bridging, rolling your own vpn, and disruption tolerant
networking will be covered. Use of Python can enable building a custom
protocols, debugging a network, fixing broken nets, custom logging and
processing, and simulation of networks. The author will talk about his
experiences using Python on Linux for extreme network programming and
possibilities for future efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
