Satellite images acquire at frequent intervals with a number of details has been used to monitor changes on the Earth. That monitoring can not only help us to see the beautiful world without leaving home but also see processes that occur on the earth to predict disaster situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I am going to explore remote sensing and how it can be connected to Python. I will show how using GDAL, NumPy and OpenCV libraries to process satellite data to create full-scale information products. I will introduce some important algorithms used to change detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is intended for Python developers who want to see how space technology answer critical questions for better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
