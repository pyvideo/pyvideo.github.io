We all want to do our jobs well, but sometimes we need a bit of extra support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain why people can struggle and how to change touchpoints like meetings, code review and timesheets to make the day-to-day easier to navigate. We will cover how to start conversations with people in your team and how small changes in language can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
