much as they ought to. This talk aims to bridge that gap, teach
practitioners about what research is out there, and spark a &amp;quot;citizen
science&amp;quot; movement in software engineering. I'll explain how to study
your own projects and get academics to pay attention. Together, we can
learn how to develop better software.&lt;/p&gt;
