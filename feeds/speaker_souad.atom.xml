&lt;p&gt;Through its 1000mercis Impacts initiative, Numberly has been actively working with tech and non tech associations over the years for social, environmental and educational causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of these commitments, we want to hand over the stage of this talk to some of our close partners.
- Margaux from Latitudes.cc will introduce you to the various ways technology can be used for general interest.
- Brieuc from Code Phoenix will share his great experience in coding teaching in prisons to help rehabilitation.
- Souad from Descodeuses will explain how her association drives more women from disadvantaged neighborhoods in tech jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for all of you who are curious to know how to use your skills for a greater good. Join us to hear and share about Tech for Good!&lt;/p&gt;
