framework. But both are ambitious software projects, approached by large
groups of diverse people trying and sometimes failing to cooperate,
collaborate, and code together. This talk shares firsthand observations,
collected over 3 years of working within the Rust and Servo teams at Mozilla
as well as volunteering on the Rust Community Team, about what all developers
can learn from Rust's approaches to the universal challenges of code and
community.&lt;/p&gt;

Dunham&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Servo browser engine, written in Rust, is a Mozilla initiative to test novel approaches to rendering the web and build components to improve Firefox. This talk is a tour through the infrastructure code behind the scenes, showing how the project uses Python at every step from greeting pull requests to delivering nightly builds. You'll also learn how you can contribute to Servo with your Python skills!&lt;/p&gt;
