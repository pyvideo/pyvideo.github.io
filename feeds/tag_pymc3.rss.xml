I hope that with these insights and consideration of how a modern (i.e., depending on some autograd system) probabilistic libraries is designed, it could help user and practitioner to write better probabilistic programs.&lt;/p&gt;

I will introduce probabilistic models, which use Bayesian statistical methods to quantify all aspects of uncertainty relevant to your problem, and provide inferences in simple, interpretable terms using probabilities.  A particularly flexible form of probabilistic models uses Bayesian &lt;em&gt;non-parametric&lt;/em&gt; methods, which allow models to vary in complexity depending on how much data are available. In doing so, they avoid the over-fitting that is common in machine learning and statistical modeling. I will demonstrate the basics of Bayesian non-parametric modeling in Python, using the PyMC3 package. Specifically, I will introduce two common types, Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, and show how they can be applied easily to real-world problems using two examples.&lt;/p&gt;

We will discuss a statistical model that the United States Supreme Court declared to be appropriate in cases of racial gerrymandering, and show how it can be implemented and used with the library &lt;cite&gt;PyMC3&lt;/cite&gt;.  We will also discuss what the model tells us about racial gerrymandering in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

I will start with an introduction to Bayesian statistics and continue by taking a look at two popular packages for doing Bayesian inference in Python, PyMC3 and PyStan.&lt;/p&gt;
