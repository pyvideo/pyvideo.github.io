By
understanding and implementing proper security measures, you guard
your own resources against malicious attackers as well as provide a
secure environment for all relevant parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the talk is to show starting points on how to improve
security in python applications by destroying a few servers during
the presentation. It will provide the most important information and
will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threat modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common attack vectors on Python applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why python is not vulnerable to some kinds of attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is eval so dangerous?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving server deployment and security management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated security testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pentesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is a CISO and why is cyber-security awareness in the company so important nowadays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic knowledge of networking, python and REST is advised.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last few years three products emerged that enable interaction with computer in a new way: Myo Armband, Leap Motion Controller and EyeTribe. The Myo Armband is a device that uses the electrical activity in your muscles to wirelessly control your computer, phone, and tablet, which is especially useful when your hands are “tied” or dirty. This device will be used to navigate through the presentation. The Leap Motion Controller tracks both hands in front of the screen. From a web developer’s perspective, both devices allows us to use gestures, previously restricted to touch devices, on desktops. EyeTribe is an affordable eye-tracking device. The talk will briefly cover setting up SDKs and python wrappers, and then focus on possible uses in daily life, business and, of course, web app development. Code examples will be included. In addition, the trade-offs between processing this new type of input data in the client versus processing input on the server will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with modern_peripherals:     Python and Flask&lt;/p&gt;
