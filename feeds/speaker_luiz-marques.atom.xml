&lt;p&gt;With modern applications being distributed, only testing is enough to
ensure your apps are healthy? The web is wild and users are
unpredictable. Having a good strategy of observability in place is
essential. In this talk, I’ll demo how to setup extensible metrics in
your app using open-source tools With the advent of microservices and
all that jazz, the complexity of monitoring applications increased quite
a lot. How many instances of my app do I have running? Are they all
healthy? How is it performing under heavy load? Questions like that can
not be answered by guesses only, but you need data to be more assertive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will create a sample web application and instrument it
using Prometheus (and potentially other tools such as Grafana, Jaeger,
Alert Manager, etc) and see in practice how we can monitor web
applications in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
