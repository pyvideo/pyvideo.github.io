&lt;p&gt;Static Site Generators are now used by many developers. If you see a .github.io domain, it means that their site is statically generated and version controlled. What I want to talk about in this lecture is why static blog generators are so popular and so powerful if you want something hackable. I'll talk about pelican, its good parts, its pitfalls as well as some custom suggestions to make your workflow faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author, Student, Speaker. Language Aficionado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently a student at university, I also work part time in web development, I speak at local conferences and workshops. I also explore other languages other than Python. Currently writing a book on PyCharm (Packt), an IDE by JetBrains. I also blog about the technologies that I use.&lt;/p&gt;

My regex is causing a Denial of Service! What can I do about it?</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2023/oh-no-my-regex-is-causing-a-denial-of-service-what-can-i-do-about-it.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every modern programming language supports regular expressions. Python
uses a backtracking engine to match developer-defined expressions
against a wide range of input. Under certain circumstances, backtracking
can lead to performance issues, and in extreme cases a denial of service
(ReDoS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use descriptive examples to demonstrate the core issue, what to
look for to detect problematic expressions, as well as how static
analysis can help in this context. We will look at techniques to improve
regular expression performance and defend against malicious inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
