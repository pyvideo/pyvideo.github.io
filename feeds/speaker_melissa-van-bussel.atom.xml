&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wiki&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;User Guide&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Handbook&amp;quot; -- whatever you call yours, we converted ours to Quarto!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, my team's documentation, which had been created using Microsoft Word, was large and lacked version control. Scrolling through the document was slow, and, due to confidentiality reasons, only one person could edit it at a time, which was a significant challenge for our team of multiple developers. After realizing we needed a more flexible solution, we successfully converted our documentation to Quarto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll discuss our journey converting to Quarto, the challenges we faced along the way, and tips and tricks for anyone else who might be looking to adopt Quarto too.&lt;/p&gt;

As Generative AI continues to evolve, the ways that we use these models should evolve, too. In this talk, we'll explore how we, as data professionals, can maximize the benefits of these tools in 2024 and how they can be incorporated into our everyday workflows. We'll also look at creative use cases that might not seem immediately obvious, but that will allow us to combine Generative AI with other data science tools that we already know and love, like Quarto and Shiny.&lt;/p&gt;
