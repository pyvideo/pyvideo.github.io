in an IRC channel: &amp;quot;I feel like I should find something to talk about at
PyconUK. I wish I had something interesting to talk about.&amp;quot; Nine seconds
later someone replied &amp;quot;create a markov chain to generate a talk from the
names of the talks at pycon and europython, then talk about how you did
that, using a title it generates as the title of the talk.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenge accepted. This is that talk, admittedly one year late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will briefly describe Markov Chains as a means to
simulate conversations and graph databases as a means to store Markov
Chains. After this, I will discuss various considerations for creating
interesting candidate responses in conversations, along with the
challenges of too little and too much data. Finally, I will demonstrate
my implementation and generate the title of this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
