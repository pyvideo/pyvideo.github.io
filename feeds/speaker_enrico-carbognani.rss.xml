techniques  in  humanoid  robotics. The focus is on humanâ€“robot
interaction with the goal of building a robotic platform which
embodiments are able to interact in natural and effective way with
humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions. The system
is fully implemented in Python and based on the Robotic Operating
System (ROS). The talk will describe the hardware and software
configuration of our currently NAO based humanoid platform.  The
strategy has been to use available high level Python libraries for
spoken language processing, sentiment analysis,  vision,  interfacing
with Artificial Intelligence applications  in   order   to   provide
current edge technologies performances.   The overall system
architecture is based on finite state machines nodes interacting via
the ROS communication layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main fields of applications that the platform is targeting are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entertainment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Field robotics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home and companion robotics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hospitality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robot Assisted Therapy (RAT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will present the latest status of the platform together with a NAO based demo.&lt;/p&gt;
