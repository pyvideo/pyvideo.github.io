&lt;p&gt;[Liffey Hall 1 on 2022-07-14]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method consists of three main steps: First, network embedding formulation performed on each user specific behavior network; Then, embeddings weight distribution estimated through intermediate layers of network with final layer for target (item purchased as labels); Finally, both factors: (a) Learned weights from implicit data (cross-domain) and (b) explicit factors from domain data used by multi-factorization method for recommendations.
The proposed method transfers knowledge across implicit and explicit factors and associated dimensions. The suggested approach tested real-world data with evidence of outperforming existing algorithms with significant lift in recommendation accuracy. Empirical experimentation outcomes illustrate the potential of both factors for making effective recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
