Unfortunately, there are exponentially-many subsets to consider, and undisciplined, manual inspection covers a tiny fraction of the possibilities. This talk will step through multiple use cases of Subset Scanning and use it to efficiently detect vulnerable/privileged subgroups and detect bias in predictive classification models at the subset level. The code is part of the Linux Foundation’s AI Fairness 360 Toolkit &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ai-fairness-360.org/"&gt;https://ai-fairness-360.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
