For the past
3 years, I have taken Artificial Intelligence classes as a student. AI
is a buzz word - It is an exciting yet daunting subject. My instructor
made these classes fun and less daunting by using real world examples
and games. I got so inspired, I started understanding and writing neural
networks in Python in no time. Now, I am trying to create the same
experience for my students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a volunteer teacher at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.corp.aiclub.world/"&gt;https://www.corp.aiclub.world/&lt;/a&gt; where I teach
AI concepts to students in 6th - 12th grade. When I create a course, I
think of how to include AI concepts in games. I write games utilizing
libraries like turtle and pygame. I consult with my instructor and they
help review my courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to share my approach, give the audiences a sneak peak at my
curriculum, and share some resources that I have created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of my curriculum:&lt;/p&gt;

The
game consists of a bird that can flap up and down as it navigates
through the gaps in many pipes to receive a higher score.Through my
adventures with python and AI, I have been learning about genetic
algorithms and how they work. I used the flappy bird to expand my
knowledge of theory and applications of genetic algorithms, neural
networks, and much more. Let me take you on my journey of creating an AI
to play Flappy Bird!&lt;/p&gt;
