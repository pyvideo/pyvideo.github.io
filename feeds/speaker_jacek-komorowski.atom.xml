&lt;p&gt;I'll present how to combine classical computer vision techniques with
deep learning methods to build a solution to automate football video
analysis. The talk will cover using deep convolutional neural networks
for ball and player detection, application of multi-view stereo methods
for 3D ball position recovery and using Spatial Transformer Networks to
boost accuracy of jersey number recognition classifier. I'll discuss
practical problems arising during long shot video analysis of football
games. Problems, that make apparently simple tasks, like ball detection,
really challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
