The ideal infrastructure is able to scale up or down as soon as needed
and provide a way to let you proactively manage your servers rather than
reactively, which in the media game is a deal breaker. It gets even
worse when you're running most of the local publication sites, including
some big name players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the infrastructure we built, using Salt for management; give
insight into the news game and provide examples of challenges our team
are facing on a daily basis while servicing users. Expanding also on the
workflow put together using various solutions such for logging,
notifications with Python acting as the coordinator to keep all these
systems in line. Delving into various parts of the system from network
monitoring to deploying code. This talk is meant for anyone interested
in getting a glimpse of the systems and workflow put in place that allow
us to manage the required load and continue developing with the agility
to make the needed quick decisions daily.&lt;/p&gt;
