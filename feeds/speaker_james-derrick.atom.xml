exclusive realm of engineers and the highly trained, but it doesn't have
to be that way! Simulation has a lot to offer to anyone interested in
investigating the world around them and while the basics may seem
overwhelming at first, it really can be valuable, and even fun to have a
working knowledge of the steps involved. This presentation is designed
to prepare you with a basic grounding in simulation and how it works so
that you too can go away and build your own simulations, or more
realistically, use simulation tools (such as Ansys) to model every day
things. In particular this presentation will take you through an example
script of PyMAPDL (our Open Source Python interface for Ansys' original
product: Mechanical APDL), modelling a simple 2D bridge&amp;nbsp;scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
