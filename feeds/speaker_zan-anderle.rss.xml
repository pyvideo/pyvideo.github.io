going? Are you familiar only with jQuery and you want to know more? Or
maybe you’re not familiar with JavaScript at all and want to learn it
but you don’t know where to start? Then this talk is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll learn about modern JavaScript from a perspective of a Python
developer. By the end of the talk you’ll know everything you need to
know about the language, its ecosystem, and different tools and
frameworks. You’ll be able to start using JavaScript more confidently
and be familiar with different tools that are at your disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll go over all the things I wish I’d known when I first got started
with JavaScript.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basics of the language (types, operators, data structures, functions,
modules, etc. as seen in ES6) and how they are similar to or
different from Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overview of the commonly used development and build tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overview of the popular frontend frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A look into the newest features of ES6 and Typescript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to get started and make sense of everything with so much going
on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
