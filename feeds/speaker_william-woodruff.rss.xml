It doesn't have to be about something that you wrote, it can be something that you learned, or a technique you think other people will be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sigstore.dev/"&gt;Sigstore&lt;/a&gt;: individual package maintainers
and users will be able to sign for and verify the authenticity of their
Python packages, respectively, without the historical and technical
baggage of PGP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will serve two purposes: (1) as a introduction to Sigstore,
and its security model, to Python developers, and (2) as a technical
overview of ongoing efforts to integrate Sigstore into Python packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will be introduced to the cryptographic fundamentals of
codesigning, how Sigstore accomplishes codesigning without long-term key
material (a critical downside to PGP), as well as the guarantees they
can derive from strong codesigning in the Python packaging ecosystem.
They'll also be introduced to the technical aspects of Sigstore's
integration into Python packaging, including a peek behind the scenes at
the standardization process and other foundational efforts required to
introduce a new codesigning format to one of the world's largest
packaging ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

forks) to provide an implementation of X.509 path validation, a
little-known but essential component of every secure HTTPS connection
made on the modern Internet. This has brought technical debt, developer
frustration (due to OpenSSL's poorly documented implementation quirks),
and a mottled security history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces an alternative, developed over the past year: a new
implementation of X.509 path validation, written from the ground-up in a
memory-safe language with standards conformance as a priority, newly
integrated into &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/"&gt;PyCA
Cryptography&lt;/a&gt;, Python's most
popular cryptographic library. We'll cover the work's implementation
details, strategies applied for reducing complexity, technical decisions
and tradeoffs made in its Rust components, as well as the work's impact
on the millions of Python developers that depend on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/"&gt;PyCA
Cryptography&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pyopenssl.org/en/latest/"&gt;PyCA
pyOpenSSL&lt;/a&gt;. Particular
attention will be dedicated to the work's critical security scope and
accompanying testing philosophy, including developed strategies for
reaching perfect test coverage and avoiding vulnerability classes that
have historically afflicted X.509 path validation implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience is expected to have an intermediate familiarity with
general Python development, including a high-level familiarity with
SSL/TLS and HTTPS (but not X.509 or X.509 path validation). Audience
members will leave the talk with a more complete understanding of the
modern Internet's security model, as well as how the Python ecosystem is
maturing to accomodate modern cryptographic best practices in networked
settings.&lt;/p&gt;

These challenges have stymied past attempts to do large-scale end-user signing in the Python ecosystem, including PyPI's former (now disabled) support for PGP signature uploads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, PyPI has designed, developed, and deployed a new approach to package signing, one that aims to break the iron triangle of end-user signing: digital attestations, as standardized in PEP 740.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the architectural details of attestations, how attestations were implemented on PyPI and on the client (uploading side), their security properties (including transparency) and advantages, as well as how PyPI was able to enable signing by default for a large swath of the ecosystem without requiring maintainers to change anything about their packaging processes. The talk will also cover the future of attestations, including pieces of the puzzle that are currently missing (like large-scale verification of attestations by parties other than PyPI itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience is expected to have an intermediate familiarity with Python packaging, including PyPI. No specific familiarity with cryptography is required. Audience members will leave the talk with an improved understanding of the challenges latent in end-user signing, how PEP 740's design and PyPI's implementation overcome those challenges, and how they can both produce and consume attestations today.&lt;/p&gt;

the PSF to implement and land major security improvements in
[Warehouse](&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/"&gt;https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/&lt;/a&gt;), the codebase that drives
[PyPI](&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org"&gt;https://pypi.org&lt;/a&gt;). This talk will cover just one of those
improvements: the addition of two factor authentication to user logins.
Attendees will learn about the technical details of two factor schemes, the
security properties they can (and can not) provide, and the process for
making major changes to core Python infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
