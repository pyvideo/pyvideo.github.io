These skills are the ones that will help us get promoted, and be seen as highly valuable within our organizations. They are especially valuable to learn as the companies around use grow - really fast. In this talk, Iâ€™ll share my top 10 skills that I practice every day, and encourage my teams of developers to embrace, so that we can all thrive as we, and our companies grow.&lt;/p&gt;
