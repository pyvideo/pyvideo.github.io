data scientists, machine learning engineers, and web developers, among
others. However, often notably absent from this list are those working
on and developing things in the physical world. Too often is the humble
hardware engineer forgotten, doomed to a fate of spreadsheets. But what
if I told you there was a whole world of hardware-focused Python? This
talk will explore various examples of Python in the world of hardware
folks, including building test fixtures, data acquisition, and
industrial automation. We’ll also look at other issues, including what
are the alternatives and why adoption of Python can be challenging. This
talk is meant for everyone, but especially those who love or want to
tinker with hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
