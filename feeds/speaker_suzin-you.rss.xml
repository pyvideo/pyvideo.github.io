&lt;p&gt;This talk walks you through how my team helped answer thousands of questions from pregnant folks and new parents on a South African maternal and child health helpline, which model we ended up choosing and why (hint: resource-constraints!), and how we've packaged everything into a service that anyone can start for themselves,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the talk, I hope you'll know how to start your own FAQ-answering service and learn about one example of doing data science in international development.&lt;/p&gt;
