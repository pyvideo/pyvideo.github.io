The Python ecosystem has several mature projects, that have spent years working on community initiatives. Newer projects can learn from their experiences and build stronger foundations to foster healthy communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we share a set of practices for community-first projects, including repository management, contributor pathways, and governance principles. We’ll also share real examples from our own journey transitioning a company-backed OSS project, Nebari (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://nebari.dev/"&gt;https://nebari.dev/&lt;/a&gt;), to be more community-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;
