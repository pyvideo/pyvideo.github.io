Should you group them by time or content? Want to tag not just your
friends, but also your pets? You know about some paid online services,
but they are not as tailor-made, and you want to keep the photos to
yourselves? Why not DIY? With image recognition by deep learning neural
networks, tedious photo tagging and searching steps can be much
simplified. Amidst the sea of selfies, skies, and food of a “Kong
girl”‘s collection, you’ll find a better way to ease your life.&lt;/p&gt;

Topics include plots commonly used in scientific communication and finance, as well as tuning figure aesthetics in the designer's perspective. Some examples will be taken from the book &amp;quot;Matplotlib 2 By Example&amp;quot;, which the speaker has co-authored.&lt;/p&gt;
