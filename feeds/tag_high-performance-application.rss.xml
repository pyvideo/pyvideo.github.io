Such applications comprise examples as computational fluid dynamics, where the analysis of large data bases is necessary in order to extract useful information. On the other hand, a common way used in the analysis of data is the visualization. It can be done by libraries as matplotlib or pandas, however more sophisticated 3D visualization can also be performed though vtk and mpi4py libraries, or even though Blender of 3d Max. The two latter case enable the use of high quality rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
