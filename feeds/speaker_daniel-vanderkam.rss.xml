may be missed by unit tests. In this talk you'll learn how to run
end-to-end tests on your client and server web libraries using a tool
called dpxdt. I'll also show how you can combine it with web-based diff
tools like &amp;quot;&amp;quot;git webdiff&amp;quot;&amp;quot; to quickly and confidently iterate on web
tools.&lt;/p&gt;
