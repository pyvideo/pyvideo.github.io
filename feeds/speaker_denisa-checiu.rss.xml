Wishing to provide a smooth ramp of complexity for learners, we designed a JupyterLab extension for Blockly, such that Jupyter can now be used all throughout a student's learning journey, without the hassle of having to switch to a completely new environment at any point along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will provide a more detailed look at the JupyterLab-Blockly extension, starting from the benefits of using it and our motivation when creating it, going through a well-documented journey of the UI, all towards a live demonstration with the kind of algorithms you can build using our standard blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A relevant aspect of the extension is also its buildability. As such, we will also dive deeper into how JupyterLab-Blockly can be used as a base for other extensions, providing the perfect tools for simple robotics applications. We will go through each step a coder needs to take in order to make their own extension and the possibilities we offer in creating your own blocks, toolboxes and even programming language generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will offer a glimpse into our very own cool robotics applications which were built on top of the JupyterLab-Blockly extension:
- jupyterlab-niryo, a plugin to control the Niryo One robot,
- jupyterlab-lego-boost, a plugin to communicate with the LEGO® Boost robot.&lt;/p&gt;
