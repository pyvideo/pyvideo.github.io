But generations of audience members have ‘grown up online’. To tell contemporary stories, don’t we need to put tech centre stage? What is digital theatre – and is it still theatre?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ada Lovelace was the daughter of a social reformer and a mad/bad/dangerous-to-know poet. She grew up to be a mathematician, an analyst, a musician, a gambler, and the first computer programmer. But the engine she coded for was never built – and she didn’t live to see whether her programme worked or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m the daughter of an English tutor and a ‘works in software’. I’ve grown up to be a playwright and a digital theatre-maker. I was also commissioned to research, write, and develop a play about Ada Lovelace, music, AI, and poetical science. But it was never staged – and I have no idea if it works in performance or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily I’m not dead yet, and I have actually managed to stage other work exploring how tech-y themes, online communities, and virtual spaces work in live theatre. My theatre-making overlaps with gaming, radio, film, and livestreaming. I love thinking about how staging the tech can create restrictions/opportunities, feeding into the form and the theme of a story. And I’m especially interested in how theatre – an artform that had to change dramatically to survive lockdown – might move forwards now that audiences are more reluctant to leave their homes than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not the kind of person who goes to the theatre then you might be the kind of person who’s up for digital theatre – poetical science, maybe, rather than just poetry. If, of course, we can agree on what digital theatre even is…&lt;/p&gt;
