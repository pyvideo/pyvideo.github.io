Inspired by the talks and workshops I attended at last year's conference, I set myself 17 tasks that would strengthen the local data science community, showcase Posit tools, and improve my own skill set. Post-conference enthusiasm was at an all-time high. Could I translate this enthusiasm into action to improve the data science training community? This talk will demonstrate how I was able to implement skills and tools from posit::conf to improve my community and highlight the current state of training in New Zealand, including the methods used to connect a small but widely dispersed group of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
