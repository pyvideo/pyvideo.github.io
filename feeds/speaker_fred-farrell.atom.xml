PyData stack. As an example we’ll present on-going work modelling the
2011 London riots, investigating how riots spread and in particular
focussing on police response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will give an introduction to Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)
using Python. ABM is a technique used to build simulated populations of
heterogeneous individuals that are governed by rules of behaviour. These
individuals, or agents, interact in simulated environments in which we
study their emergent behaviour. We build agent-based models in order to
try explain why people do what they do. In this talk, we'll briefly show
how we develop and validate agent populations. We will then present
on-going work modelling the 2011 London riots, investigating how riots
spread and in particular focussing on police response. Finally, we’ll
discuss why we use Python and the PyData stack to develop models, and
mention how we are starting to use machine learning (scikit-learn) for
learning rules of behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
