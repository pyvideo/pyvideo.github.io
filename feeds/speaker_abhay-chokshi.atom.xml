includes microcopy for the user interfaces. However, that is not
correct. Writing snappy messages on the UI is only a part of it; more
important aspect is developing a voice for the product and imbibing that
voice in your content (UX, help, knowledge base, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers some of the necessary skills required for being good at
UX writing and how these skills help us in designing a better product
experience. Whether be it the decision of keeping the tone professional
vs casual or using title case vs sentence case, decisions must be taken
based on the audience and should always be in-context.&lt;/p&gt;
