one that has existed since our paths started crossing. We'll talk about
how to be mindful of design in your own open source project and how to
attract designers to help your project become even more awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an ever present rift between designers and developers and it is
one that has existed since our paths started crossing. While it has
almost become a requirement for designers to be able to grok the code
they work with on a daily basis, that has unfortunately had no effect on
the willingness of designers to work on open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, if your project is in need of a designer, there are ways
that you can make your project more appealing to our “special breed” of
personality. In this quick talk, we’ll jump into the mind of your
typical designer, show you just how many similarities we share and then
apply that knowledge to make your project easy and appealing for
designers to jump into.&lt;/p&gt;
