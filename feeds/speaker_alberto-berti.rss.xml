to break it into two main areas where the effort on the server,
with the typical WSGI environments, focuses on data access configuration
whereas the application logic is delegated mostly to the client through
the use of JavaScript frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this separation into two roles lies in the need to use
JavaScript on the browser and the fact that the communication
channel (HTTP) and the way in which the application state is handled
on the server side is still that thought to serve full web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll show a framework and an application where the line
between the two worlds is blurred and where it is possible to think
of the application in terms of unity, with the two components that
cooperate equally and communicate without thinking in terms of URLs
or HTTP verbs .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is made possible by the asynchronous/reactive management
of the processing from the database driver to the user interaction,
the use of websocket for communication and the use of Python (optional)
for the development of the client part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some technologies used are: PostgreSQL, the &amp;quot;asyncpg&amp;quot; driver, the
&amp;quot;aiohttp&amp;quot; web server, Crossbar (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://crossbar.io"&gt;http://crossbar.io&lt;/a&gt;) for the websocket
comms, pkg &amp;quot;metapensiero.sphinx.patchdb&amp;quot; for schema upgrades,
the package &amp;quot;metapensiero.reactive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;metapensiero.signal&amp;quot;
for the management of reactive event streams,
the package &amp;quot;Javascripthon&amp;quot; for Py3 to ES6 JS transpiling.&lt;/p&gt;
