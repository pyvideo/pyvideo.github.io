&lt;p&gt;Before my team and I create an internal solution in-house, I'd like to talk about why we chose Slackbot, how we considered the technology stack, and what we can create with Slackbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I'd like to share the fun of improving the work environment within the team by creating a ChatOps solution based on Slackbot!&lt;/p&gt;

Hello, I'm Shin Hee-jae, a backend/DevOps engineer at crypto startup Alokados. I like Python and have enjoyed developing with Python, so I'm very honored to be hosting this PyCon 2023 session. There are many shortcomings, but I'll prepare hard :)&lt;/p&gt;
