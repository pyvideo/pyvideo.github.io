tightly with pandas and other libraries from the PyData stack. It offers
a DataFrame API that wraps pandas and thus offers an easy transition
into the big data space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, Dask was the easiest choice to use (it’s just pandas) but
struggled to achieve robust performance (there were many ways to
accidentally perform poorly). It was great for experts, but bad for
novices. Other tools (Spark, DuckDB, Polars) just did this better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, these pain points have been fixed with the following
features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new and vastly improved shuffle algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A logical query planning layer to improve performance and usability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reduced memory footprint through a more efficient data model due to
pandas 2.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will look into how these changes work together across pandas, Arrow,
and Dask to provide a better UX and a more robust and faster system
overall. Additionally, we will look into a comparison of Dask against
other tools in the big data space, including Spark, Polars and DuckDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use the TPC-H benchmarks to compare these tools. We will look
ahead into what the future will bring for pandas and Dask and how the
logical query planning layer can be extended to fit other frameworks
like Dask Array and XArray.&lt;/p&gt;

Many of these datasets are publicly available, providing a great resource for analysis, but working with them requires increasingly large computational resources and a diverse set of tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start by briefly introducing Dask and Xarray, which form the backbone of the geospatial stack in Python. Using the ERA5 dataset as a case study, we will demonstrate how Xarray can be used to explore large-scale climate data effectively from your local laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on this foundation, we will delve into recent advancements in Dask Array. Originally designed as a parallel NumPy API, Dask Array was used to handle much larger datasets over the last few years. We’ll explore the latest developments in Dask and Xarray that continue to expand the scalability and capabilities of these tools to catch up with the scale requirements of modern datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion will highlight improvements in ease of use, scalability, and performance. Additionally, we’ll present the first-ever set of geospatial benchmarks, collected earlier in 2024 from the community. These benchmarks provide a clear illustration of the scale at which Xarray and Dask are required to operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’ll offer a peak behind the scenes of an ongoing project aimed at building the first ever query optimizer for large scale array computations.&lt;/p&gt;
