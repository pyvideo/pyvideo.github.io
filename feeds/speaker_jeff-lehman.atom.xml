generations. A lot of the concepts have not changed over the years, but
the technologies that enable Hams to talk around the world have evolved
and developed greatly over the years. Ham Radio is all about

what if there is not something that you can find that quite fits what
you want to be able to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will look at some of the ways that Python can be used
