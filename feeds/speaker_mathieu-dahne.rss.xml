&lt;p&gt;This is the story of two years working inside Admiral to launch a new
digital product, Veygo, from a 5 man team launching an MVP in 7 weeks to
a successful company of 30+ people two years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will tell you of the challenges we faced, how we solved them with a
very agile (by corporate standards) tech stack: Django DjangoRest React
React Native AWS EB CircleCI, and how we managed to keep the startup
mindset focusing on the most important problems and continue iterating
quickly on the product and shipping features efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
