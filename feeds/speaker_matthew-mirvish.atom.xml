This ranges from automating the generation of &amp;quot;factor trees&amp;quot;, which became a script that generated at least 10 different images creating a giant poster of information that barely works, to writing an entire 3d engine from scratch for a project to model a backyard. The code behind these endeavors is sometimes crazy, and often has a pretty funny story behind it. At least itâ€™s better than whatever garbage that a block based programming tool educators keep pushing on me will create! I will also be posting all the code (as well as some that didn't make the talk) in a giant git repository on my github afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
