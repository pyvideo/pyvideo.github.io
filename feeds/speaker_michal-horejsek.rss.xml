&lt;p&gt;„Selenium automates browser.“ Selenium can be used as tool for testing
web applications. At first it can be pretty hard to start testing with
Selenium, but later on it can be even harder. I want to show you that
it doesn't have to be true. That it can be easy, actually. But you
have to know few things which you have to be careful about and that
there is tool webdriverwrapper which can make it easy for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will speak about handling pages with JavaScript and which common
problem can you have, how to run Selenium on servers without X server,
how to deal with tabs, how to test with UnitTest or pytest, and how
can webdriverwrapper make things easier for you and more.&lt;/p&gt;
