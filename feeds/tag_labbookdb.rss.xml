The core concept of LabbookDB is that most of the information classically tracked in a lab book can be more efficiently and more reliably stored in a relational database. We overcome the portability limitations of designed-for-analysis spreadsheets and databases by building the database schema around atomized physical interactions of objects in the laboratory (and providing ready-for-analysis dataframes as a compatibility layer). LabbookDB provides a wet work metadata storage model excellently suited for explorative ex-post reporting and analysis, as well as a great infrastructure for automated wet work tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
