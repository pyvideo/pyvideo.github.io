We need
tons of secrets to do our Dev job, and at the same time, make us as
potential suspects during data breaches or cyberattacks. It is totally
unavoidable, until now. In this session, 2 open source projects, Conjur
&amp;amp; Secretless, will be introduced. The speaker will explain how to enable
your apps to work without secrets, such that you &amp;amp; your apps are both
secured.&lt;/p&gt;
