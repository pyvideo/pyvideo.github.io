Here we describe how we built Covasim (covasim.org), an agent-based COVID model, by using standard Python libraries like NumPy, Numba, and SciPy along with less common ones like Sciris (sciris.org). Covasim was created in a few weeks, an order of magnitude faster than the typical model development process, and achieves performance comparable to C++ despite being written in pure Python. It is now used by researchers and policymakers in more than a dozen countries.&lt;/p&gt;

Built on NumPy, Numba, and SciPy, Starsim's performance rivals ABMs implemented in Java or C++, but with the convenience provided by Python: specifically, the ability to quickly implement and refine new disease modules. Starsim can also be extended to other applications in which people interact on timescales from days to decades, including economics and social science.&lt;/p&gt;
