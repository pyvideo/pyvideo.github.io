reduce bugs, but code review can be so much more than that! In this
talk, I’ll share how reviewing code became one of the most valuable ways
for me to become a better programmer. I’ll cover how you can learn more
from code review, how you can improve your skills as a reviewer, and how
to influence your colleagues to give you better code review.&lt;/p&gt;

totally mystifies us. We'll look at three areas where wats arise -
identity, mutability, and scope. For each of these three topics, we'll
look at some common surprising behaviors, investigate the cause of the
behaviors, and cover some practical tips on how to avoid related bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
