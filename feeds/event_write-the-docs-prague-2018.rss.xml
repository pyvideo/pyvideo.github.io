people know much of it. This talk gives a quick overview of the major
formats, including nroff/troff, SGML, HTML, Docbook, TeX and LaTeX,
setext, reStructuredText, markdown and AsciiDoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In passing, I shall complain briefly about the history of wiki markups,
and explain my reservations about markdown, and why it’s still a good
thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slides, and extended notes, will be available at

Our
docs were kept in numerous places, from Google Drive to Wikis to Github
folders to...places we may not even have found yet! In response we
started a working group called The Better Docs Project, with the mission
of organizing, standardizing, and completing our documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk we’ll go on a narrative journey through the first year
of Better Docs, talking about what worked for us, what didn’t work, what
we’re excited to try next, and the lessons we’ve learned (and friends
we’ve made) along the way. I’ll share actionable tips for how to steal
our experience to get your own projects and workplaces on the road to
Better Docs.&lt;/p&gt;

community ‐ and it’s not hard to figure out why. According to the World
Health Organization, there are over one billion people globally who need
an assistive device. With these statistics, organizations and open
source projects alike realize that they could be unintentionally locking
these people out of their products. As a result, they adjust their
developer workflows. And it often ends there, at the product.
Documentation is left out of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If documentation is meant to serve as a tool for learning and
comprehension, then it must be included in those conversations. After
all, we want to write docs that are truly for everyone ‐ regardless of
the technology they use to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll look at how assistive technology consumes
documentation and cover some points to consider when building out your
docs. Along the way, we’ll touch on quick regulation wins and inclusive
writing practices.&lt;/p&gt;

just come back from a conference, you may feel like &amp;quot;Now is the time for
change!&amp;quot;. However, your first step should be analysis. Before you can
decide this is the right moment for a new tool, let alone choose a tool,
you need to assess your organization's needs and current status. Your
decision should be defined by a triangle of factors: bigger picture
strategic goals, operational reality, related processes, and existing
systems. But when it isn't the right time, it is still possible to make
progress with continued assessment and incremental change...&lt;/p&gt;

kinds of teams to help them use process mapping to document their
processes. Sifting through binders of documentation, pages of
screenshots, and step‐by‐step explanations can be time consuming and
awkward, and large quantities of documentation are time consuming to
keep up to date. System updates would quickly render screenshots
obsolete, and teams were quickly getting overwhelmed, giving up on
documentation entirely. I started to apply my lean expertise to the art
of process mapping, putting together a best practice toolkit to maintain
a minimalist approach to documenting processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss best practice in process mapping for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;visual instruction in user guides and how‐to’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mapping process at high levels, avoiding getting bogged down in
detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assessing possible failure points to anticipate customer pain points
(to manage through customer documentation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

If you’re like me, you’ve
written lots of documentation like this. We all want our products to be
simple. Worse, lots of us believe our products are simple. But trust me,
they’re not simple! Your installation guide failed on step 2, and I
don’t know how to fix it! In this talk I highlight some writing styles
which seem innocuous when written, but which show a lack of sympathy
when read. I suggest some ways to avoid these pitfalls and bridge the
gap with your reader.&lt;/p&gt;

and think, “how did this happen?” Be it a large swath of unorganized
content or a lack of a clear strategy, the complications of bad docs
aren’t just a curse for documentation editors. Our readers see it, too.
It leads to confused support requests and possibly a loss of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started at Joyent, I was continuously made aware of documentation
that needed help, and it felt like a nonstop firefight. Over time, I was
able to quell the fires, create a content strategy, and completely
redefine how our documentation works. Then all of my work was blown up a
second time ‐ this time, starting from scratch with a not yet existing
product. From this experience, I’ve learned it’s all about being
organized and having a clear strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to get buy‐in for a documentation do‐over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to pivot from rewriting docs to starting from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;content strategy (and how to write a great one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;empathy for our readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;setting easy‐to‐follow guidelines for non‐professional writers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also touch on how to prioritize and manage all of this work
without additional full‐time documentation help.&lt;/p&gt;

How
much concealer would you put on it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of people would likely agree that no product is ever
perfect. When it comes to software, the jokes about bugs practically
write themselves. Should the product documentation acknowledge this, or
should it cover up the imperfections? In some cases, the answer seems
obvious, but what about those situations where there is a major known
issue - or five? How should the person in charge of documentation
address this? Should they just stick a big warning into the release
notes, or point out the problem and offer a quick workaround in the
documentation itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only a content issue, but also a question of ethics. It is a
challenge that has come up time and again in my personal (albeit short)
career as a technical writer, and I suspect many others have faced it,
too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will look at some strategies that writers can rely on if they
decide this is an issue worth considering. Important aspects that will
be covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the tone and language used when addressing product shortcomings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;communication with stakeholders, product managers and other
subject-matter experts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dealing with clunky or unintuitive UIs and workflows that are not
officially recognized as issues, but are still impeding the user
experience and understanding of the product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

particularly glamorous, and tends not to get much love: the humble
release note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined my current company back in September 2017, I noticed we
didn’t have a consistent format for our release notes, and they were
often clunky and difficult to understand. And when I did a bit of
research to see if there were any generally accepted formats, I was
surprised at how little guidance I found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised I had plenty of my own ideas about what made a good release
note (from reading and writing many over the years), so I gathered them
together and gradually formed them into a style guide. Drawing from
this, I’ll talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making release notes easier to write ‐ and read ‐ by grouping them
into categories and then using templates to write them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how you can improve readability with a few simple style tweaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;viewing release notes as a ready‐made opportunity to show your users
the hard work you’ve put into your product ‐ the bugs you’ve fixed,
and the suggestions you’ve listened to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

do you prove that docs are key to growing a software business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentarians have long struggled to get buy-in from stakeholders and
win more budget because the impact of docs on a company’s bottom line
has never been clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things like traffic analysis, at best, tell you whether customers are
facing a recurring problem, or if they’re finding your docs easily.
Article ratings also help you understand if customers find your docs
useful. But to prove that docs actually impact your bottom line, you
need to dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll share new models I’ve designed to help measure if
your docs drive customer growth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would your company look like without docs? (A basic control for
measuring success)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do your docs help win new users? (Acquisition-focused attribution)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are users who read your docs more likely to take the key steps to
become customers? (Activation-focused attribution)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can docs help convert new customers into loyal advocates?
(Retention-focused attribution)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll demonstrate how you can apply these models to your business, with
both theoretical and practical advice.&lt;/p&gt;

small start up in little old New Zealand. To help our Support team scale
as the business quickly grew, we needed to invest in a fool-proof
self-service strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work in an industry with customers that don't identify themselves as
&amp;quot;tech savvy&amp;quot;, so to help them get up and running with our product
quickly we needed friendly, accessible and engaging product education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video was one of the first things we identified as being a crucial part
of our product education strategy. In this talk, I'll share my
experience with using, producing and managing videos, as part of
documenting an ever-changing and evolving product. We’ll chat about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

debt in our documentation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As technical communicators, it’s very easy to get caught up in the cycle
of moving from one release to another without taking time to refine what
already exists. Trying to keep up with documenting new features means we
often find ourselves navigating though outdated and disused
stylesheets/labels/files/content/junk in projects that we inherited from
technical communicators before us and haven’t had the time to clean up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds familiar, then this presentation is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It aims to help you tackle the daunting task of cleaning up your project
and getting rid of technical debt once and for all. We will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is technical debt, how does it accrue, and why should your
organisation care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you can tackle your debt and give your documentation project the
spring clean it needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tips for staying debt‐free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

My title is &amp;quot;Information Architect&amp;quot;, but that’s mostly
because &amp;quot;She Who Figures Out What We Need To Do About Our Documentation
And Does It&amp;quot; is too wordy for HR. I work in a product unit of about 350
people creating software for developers, very few of them skilled
writers or native speakers of English. My role is to figure out how we
can produce good documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a problem of scale: I can’t do all of the technical writing we
need. So instead, I’ve become a contagious documentarian. Over the last
year, I’ve [STRIKEOUT:infected] taught technical writing to over 200
people around my company. My 3 1/2 hour course, &amp;quot;Technical Writing for
Techies&amp;quot;, is popular, and seems to be effective. There’s been a
noticeable improvement in the writing we’re producing, and (even better)
an awareness that good writing is an achievable, even enjoyable, thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I describe the course formally, I tend to list attendee objectives
such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about the audience and how to write for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study and practice different writing techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand and use a style guide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn ways to improve word choice and sentence structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study the commonest mistakes that non‐native speakers make in English
and how to correct them. (etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do cover all of those topics. But just between us, my real
objectives for my students are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay awake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel welcome and relaxed enough to participate openly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish the course feeling competent and capable about writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust the Information Architect enough to come to her with future
problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to be part of a community of documentarians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll talk about the course structure, some of the ways I’ve designed and
delivered it to meet both sets of objectives, how it has evolved over
time, and what I’ve learned while giving it.&lt;/p&gt;

We used modern development practices and tools to document the code and
the APIs exposed by our microservices, but was that enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces the audience to the particularities of developing
medical device software and the regulatory landscape that you must
comply with. I’ll focus specifically on the processes and culture that
enables the creation of medical software device documentation intended
for auditors, without damaging (too much) the team velocity and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
