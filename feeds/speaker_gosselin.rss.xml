With Taipy, Data Scientists/Python Developers will be able to build great pilots as well as stunning production-ready applications for end-users. Taipy provides two independent modules: Taipy GUI and Taipy Core. In this talk, we will demonstrate how: Taipy GUI goes way beyond the capabilities of the standard graphical stack. Taipy Core is simpler yet more powerful than the standard Python back-end stack.&lt;/p&gt;
