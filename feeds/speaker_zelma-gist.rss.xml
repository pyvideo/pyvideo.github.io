We will go over how to create automated visual tests that are both scalable and simple to implement.
Most of us will agree that testing CSS changes is importantâ€¦in theory. But when you have limited development time and no QA resources, how do you ensure that pages look as expected after CSS changes? Instead of constantly having to click around we can programmatically detect UI changes
In this talk I will start with how to set up your existing test environment with automated visual tests using Python and Selenium. Then we will discuss a few pit falls that I ran into when implementing visual regression testing
The audience will be expected to have a general understanding about how test cases are set up in Django&lt;/p&gt;
