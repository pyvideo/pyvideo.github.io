are very good at distinguishing patterns from interconnected

when applied to graph data structures. However, as these structures
become more complex or embed more information over time, both visual
and algorithmic methods get messy; visual analyses suffer from the
&amp;quot;hairball&amp;quot; effect, and graph algorithms require either more traversal
or increased computation at each vertex. A growing area to reduce this
complexity and optimize analytics is the use of interactive and
subgraph techniques that model how graph structures change over time.&lt;/p&gt;

A growing area to reduce this complexity and optimize analytics is the use of interactive and subgraph techniques that model how graph structures change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I demonstrate two practical techniques for embedding time into graphs, not as computational properties, but rather as structural elements. The first technique is to add time as a node to the graph, which allows the graph to remain static and complete, but minimizes traversals and allows filtering. The second is to represent a single graph as multiple subgraphs where each is a snapshot at a particular time. This allows us to use time series analytics on our graphs, but perhaps more importantly, to use animation or interactive methodologies to visually explore those changes and provide meaningful dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we will begin by exploring the features of the NLTK library. We will then focus on building a language-aware data product - a topic identification and document clustering algorithm from a web crawl of blog sites. The clustering algorithm will use a simple Lesk K-Means clustering to start, and then will improve with an LDA analysis using the popular Gensim library.&lt;/p&gt;
