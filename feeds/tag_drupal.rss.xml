Drupal and Django have much in common. They’re both open source tools for building the web. They’re also marked by some fundamental differences. However, both are so much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret!&amp;quot; - Charles Dickens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore the darkly clustered houses of these two different communities of open source people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What common challenges do we face?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What different approaches do we take?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we learn from each other?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, what could we do together?&lt;/p&gt;
