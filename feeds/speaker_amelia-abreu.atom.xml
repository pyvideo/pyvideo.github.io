of care: good documentation can make us feel cared-for, and we, as
writers, can take satisfaction from empathizing with the end users of
our work, and performing the caring work of documentation. By exploring
and acknowledging the relationship between care, documentation, and
technology, I argue, we can better understand and advocate for the value
of our work. More so, understanding the importance of care allows us to
work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk illustrates how the work of documentation is care work, and
explores the ethical, philosophical and economic dimensions of care in
relationship to technical writing and documentation. I'll share findings
and case studies from my own consulting practice, and explore patterns
(and anti-patterns) I've observed around documentation and care. Then,
to spur small group discussions, I'll share design principles for
documentation as care.&lt;/p&gt;
