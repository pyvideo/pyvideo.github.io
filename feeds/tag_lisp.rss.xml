I'll present Áireamhán, a small Lisp-like language that I built (in Python of course), that is, as far as I know, the first and only programming language &lt;em&gt;as Gaeilge&lt;/em&gt;. I'll cover some of the core ideas in language design; lexing, parsing, tokenization, with an emphasis on how you can compactly implement these in Python to build your own language. I'll also discuss the features of Lisp (and Áireamhán), and how these functional programming primitives give us a really powerful framework for computation that inspired some of the parts of Python that we all know and love.&lt;/p&gt;
