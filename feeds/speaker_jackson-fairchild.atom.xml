It doesn't matter whether it is a labour of love, or you are working to pay the bills, or that delicious combination of both, there is a risk that one day you will hit the wall. Burnout is a looming menace in many communities, particularly those with long hours, tight deadlines, rigid dependencies, complex intellectual demands, uncertain rewards and moving goalposts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does it happen? How can we learn to understand ourselves well enough to spot the signs in ourselves and in other? How can we repair the damage and come back from the brink? Jackson Fairchild will present a lively, enlightening and funny talk based on his experience as both an experienced mental health clinician and a person who works too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
