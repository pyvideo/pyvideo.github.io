What's going on?</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-au-2021/hey-python-web-community-whats-going-on.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Vibhu Agarwal) Django, Flask or FastAPI, ASGI-WSGI, asynchronous-synchronous, protocol or web server, workers or threads, gunicorn-uvicorn - &lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; is going on!? What exactly are these? How do they come along together? Do I even need to know about them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing back-ends for dynamic websites can be done in a lot of different ways, and fortunately, python has a great set of libraries and packages to help us with the implementation. The problem arises when we dive deep and are overwhelmed with the stuff we have at our disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk, we'll try to find answers to the above questions. We'll take a look at the high-level and core features of different parts and understand how they are kept compatible with each other to bring out a fantastic web ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
