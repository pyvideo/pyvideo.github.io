As part of the ROSE project, the students learn about Open Source, basic Linux shell skills, and Python programming. As a final project, they write an algorithm in Python for a self driving car in a race game. The project gives an excellent opportunity to 8th grade students to experience both the world of coding and communication with other communities that they are not regularly in contact with. How does this work? Why use Python of all the languages? How can coding bring people from different cultures closer? Can we make it fun? In this session, we will present the project structure, the team activities, the code competition and our experience leading this project last year.&lt;/p&gt;
