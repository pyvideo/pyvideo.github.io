&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;R is an incredibly powerful statistical programming language. It is the
choice for powerful set and forgets analytics. However it is a
specialist language without strong functionality in other areas. In
areas where significant preprocessing of data, or where the statistics
produced are part of a larger system such as looking for patterns in the
load behaviour of a web server, a match with a strong general language
is an obvious solution. Because of its wide use and potential
integration with R, python is that language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be targeted at python programmers who wish to integrate
statistical and data analysis into their work, providing options for
real time data monitoring and analysis. This talk is accessible for
anyone with a basic understanding of python.&lt;/p&gt;
