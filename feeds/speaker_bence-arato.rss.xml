&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to introduce the most important visualization libraries, covering Matplotlib, Plotly, Bokeh and Altair, among others. It also provides a summary of the quickly developing dashboarding solutions, including Dash, Panel and Voila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of talk is not just to provide a simple list of libraries, but also to highlight the main characteristics and inspirations for each, and summarize the recent developments as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed to people who have some basic experience working with data in Python and would like to get a better understanding of the data visualization tool landscape.  Some existing knowledge of pandas DataFrames is beneficial for understanding the examples, but not required.&lt;/p&gt;
