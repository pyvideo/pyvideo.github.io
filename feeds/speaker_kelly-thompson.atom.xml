investigating large-scale de-duplication of physical collections. These
collection management efforts require trustworthy, complete data and
must consider not just local needs, but shared print retention
commitments, preservation of scarce and at-risk materials, and
continuous access to licensed electronic versions. While common
solutions exist for monographic resources, these questions remain much
harder to answer for serials. The pymarc and pandas libraries offer
effective tools for analyzing bibliographic data to generate “families”
of both print and electronic serial records, and compare holdings of
those titles as part of large-scale de-duplication efforts.Presenter(s):
