are generated per minute. This data flow transforms a common and, in
general, tedious task such as accounting into an interesting big data
engineering problem. At Smarkets, accounting reports serve two main
purposes: housekeeping of our financial operations and documentation for
the relevant regulation authorities. In both cases, reliability and
accuracy are crucial in the final result. The fact that these reports
are generated daily, the need to cope with failure when retrieving data
from previous days, and the fast growing transaction volume obsoleted
the original accounting system and required a new pipeline that could
scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk presents the ETL pipeline designed to meet the constraints
highlighted above, and explains the motivations behind the tech stack
chosen for the job, which includes Python3, Luigi and Spark among
others. These topics will be covered by describing the main technical
problems solved with our design: - Fault tolerance and reliability, i.e
ability to identify faulty steps and only rerun those instead of the
whole pipeline. - Fast input/output. - Fast computations.&lt;/p&gt;
