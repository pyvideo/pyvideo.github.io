At Desti, we had to get our search from taking multiple seconds to an average of 300ms. To achieve that goal, we developed a tool and methodology for measurement, and employed multiple techniques of optimization. We improved our architecture, system design, and implementation before reaching that goal. In this talk, Iâ€™ll share our measurement tool and methodology, and the optimization techniques we used.&lt;/p&gt;
