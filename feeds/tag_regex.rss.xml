pages. You could revisit your favorite web site every time it updates
for new information. Or you could write a web scraper to have it do it
for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to learn how to scrape the web (and / or organized data sets and
APIs) for content? This talk will give you the building blocks (and
code) to begin your own scraping adventures. We will review basic data
scraping, API usage, form submission as well as how to scrape pesky bits
like Javascript-usage for DOM manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides looking at how websites are put together, we will also discuss
the ethics of scraping. What is legal? How can you be a friendly
scraper, so that the administrator of the website you are scraping wonâ€™t
try to shut you down?&lt;/p&gt;
