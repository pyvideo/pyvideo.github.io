small start up in little old New Zealand. To help our Support team scale
as the business quickly grew, we needed to invest in a fool-proof
self-service strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We work in an industry with customers that don't identify themselves as
&amp;quot;tech savvy&amp;quot;, so to help them get up and running with our product
quickly we needed friendly, accessible and engaging product education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video was one of the first things we identified as being a crucial part
of our product education strategy. In this talk, I'll share my
experience with using, producing and managing videos, as part of
documenting an ever-changing and evolving product. Weâ€™ll chat about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why you should be making videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When to use videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you shouldn't be making videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to develop a video strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make great product tutorials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to start your adventure in video, this talk will give
you insight into how to develop and deliver a video strategy, with some
helpful insights and lessons learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
