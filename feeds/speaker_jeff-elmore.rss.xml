Language Toolkit for Python. You may not be familiar with Linkgrammar,
which is a sentence parsing system created at Carnegie Melon university.
Linkgrammar is quite robust and works &amp;quot;out of the box&amp;quot; in a way that
NLTK does not for sentence parsing.&lt;/p&gt;

A
variety of models have been developed, but few have focused on books for
emerging readers (Grades K-2). We used Python for nearly every aspect of
the project including collecting data from reading educators, analyzing
text features and psychometric data, and creating a predictive model.
Tools used include scipy, scikit-learn, pandas, and extensive use of the
IPython Notebook which is demonstrated in the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
