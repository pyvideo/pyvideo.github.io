In a virtual environment, robot application specialists may program, visualize, and test their robotic application before uploading it to the real production environment, saving time and costs. However, to achieve a high level of fidelity between virtual and production environments, the robot system must be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even though most industrial robots are inherently precise (i.e., repeatable), they are not necessarily very accurate. One cost-effective approach to obtaining a more accurate robot is through calibration, where the actual kinematic and non-kinematic parameters of the robot model are identified and improved upon when compared to the nominal model. This talk introduces pybotics, an open-source Python toolbox for robot kinematics and calibration&lt;/p&gt;
