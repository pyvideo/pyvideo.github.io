An overview of the methodology for this technique, called content-based image retrieval, will be presented. Techniques for improving search accuracy and retrieval time will also be discussed. The intended audience is individuals who have intermediate Python experience and a limited or basic familiarity with machine learning and computer vision techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
