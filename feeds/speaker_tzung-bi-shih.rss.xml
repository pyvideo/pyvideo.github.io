&lt;p&gt;ZoneIDAProc provides an easy way to export Linux proc-like interface for python program.  It is intuitive and convenient for showing process internal data; even expose a complex computation.  The talk focuses on demonstrating the magic of ZoneIDA and how it increases your program's versatility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve high throughput, we usually execute independent tasks simultaneously in a process through leveraging multi-threaded technology.  The tasks are truly parallel because multi-processor and hyper-threading technologies are quite mature in modern x86 CPU.  While thing happens within CPython, the behavior will not be what we think.  The talk addresses on CPython limitation of parallelism and enumerates some common practices to evade the seal.&lt;/p&gt;
