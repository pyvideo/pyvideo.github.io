Learning about learning is an increasingly important skill in today's world of rapidly evolving technology. I will share my experience teaching computer science and computer programming starting with being a part of the team that changed my university's Intro to Programming course from using C++ to Python. Then, I'll share tools I've used to engage students in Python programming including repl.it and Raspberry Pi and run through some of the lessons I've taught with them. I'll also discuss education best practices and how learners can apply them to their own self-education.&lt;/p&gt;
