&lt;p&gt;Looking to make your scientific code faster and more efficient for training and prototyping? In the AI era, computing requirements and expenses are outpacing available resources. To stay ahead, efficient code is no longer a luxury - it has become a NECESSITY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will delve into the best practices and techniques for an optimized utilization of Python scientific libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy highlighting common pitfalls and failure modes that can hinder performance. By going through some live demos (&amp;quot;what could possibly go wrong?&amp;quot; - North Bay Python 2024), we will learn how simple changes to our code can lead to significant optimizations, resulting in faster and more capacity-friendly solutions. We will gain insights into advanced programming concepts, such as NumPy vectorization, column-based vs row-based data frames and arrays, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a data scientist, machine learning engineer, researcher, or software engineer, we will showcase tips and strategies that can improve the efficiency of your code and accelerate your AI projects.&lt;/p&gt;

Python, with its robust ecosystem of tools, plays a significant role in this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will bring a fresh perspective on how we, at Meta, provide tools for efficient ML prototyping for our researchers and ML engineers. We will first go through a comprehensive overview of the ML lifecycle and then deep dive into the ML prototyping phase, emphasizing on its significance. We will focus on conda for environment management and jupyter notebooks for interactive development â€” two powerful tools that streamline development and experimentation at Meta and in the industry, in general. In the last part of the talk, I will highlight interesting examples of improvements made to these tools at Meta for efficient prototyping, accelerating the developer productivity in the AI space.&lt;/p&gt;

However, many Python programmers struggle to share their scripts and packages with others due to a lack of understanding about Python packaging.
Join me on a journey to demystify modern Python packaging and learn the end-to-end mechanism of creating, publishing, and managing Python packages. Whether you are new to Python packaging or want to sharpen your skills around modern Python packaging techniques or are a curious Pythonista, I hope for everyone to learn something new here or just have fun with packaging!&lt;/p&gt;
