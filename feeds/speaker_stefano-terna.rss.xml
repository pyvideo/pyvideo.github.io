IoT was a couple of years ago). But think of an industrial IoT project
connecting thousands of remote and inaccessible devices which should be
kept secure and updated over time. Now, imagine you can just write
Python code for your devices, test it over-the-internet both locally in
the lab, and in a real test environment simply by pushing your code to
specific branches and finally just pushing to master to update the
entire fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk we will use Iottly to showcase this continuous delivery
pattern for the internet of things, with live code and connected devices
(Raspberry Pi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iottly is a Development and Management Cloud Service for IoT Projects,
built by TomorrowData. Iottly is written in Python and is open source
(github). It features a Python sandbox for the devices, an online editor
to program the devices over-the-internet, and the integration with git
as the base for continuous delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
