state of GraphQL in Python. This talk describes what GraphQL is, why it
has been created and the current state of GraphQL libraries in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a short history of GraphQL, some examples of what makes it
shine and why it can be preferred to REST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also analyse the current state of GraphQL in Python, having a
brief overview of the current libraries and then having an in-depth look
at Strawberry a new library based on dataclasses that makes it easy to
create GraphQl APIs in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
