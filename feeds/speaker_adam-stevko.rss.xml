Security is a shared responsibility and has
become even more important than ever before. Nevertheless, not everybody
realizes this and security incidents and problems continue to occur,
thus resulting in catastrophical consequences for your business. In this

less vulnerable code by using tools to prevent security holes, how to
handle incidents from the developers’ point of view and how you can
assist your Security Engineers. By following these guidelines, you will
make your Security Engineers happy and your code more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
