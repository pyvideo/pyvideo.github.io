programming language - What does this error mean? What's the difference
between a for loop and a while loop? How does pass-by-reference
evaluation work? What are classes? How do I even begin to turn this task
into a working program?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is widely used as a language for learning to program, and for
good reasons, but there are still plenty of ways that students can get
stuck, both in learning the language, and in learning more abstract
programming concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present a number of challenges frequently faced by
beginner students in a university course which teaches students Python
from the ground up, and how the course material was redesigned both to
make it easier for students to learn, but also to ensure that students
encountered all of the necessary challenges so that they'd have
something to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
