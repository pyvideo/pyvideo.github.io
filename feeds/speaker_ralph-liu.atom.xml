&lt;p&gt;While NetworkX is amazing for getting started with Graphs, the library encounters bottlenecks in performance at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a solution out there for users who want more performance from NX and also Open-Source developers who want to implement fast algorithms? Yes! Thanks to the magic of dispatching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NetworkX now supports dispatching to various backends, including the GPU accelerated cuGraph library by Nvidia RAPIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attend this talk to learn about how you can use nx-cugraph – the cuGraph-powered backend for NetworkX – and how it unlocks exciting new possibilities for you to solve real-world graph analytics problems.&lt;/p&gt;
