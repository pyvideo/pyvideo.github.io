&lt;p&gt;Chris Adams, from the Green Web Foundation and ClimateAction.tech will show how to quantify the emissions from the digital projects you work on, and how to make measurable differences, from optimising code, to thinking structurally about how you spend your time as a web professional.&lt;/p&gt;

As software engineers, part of our job is accelerating this shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's easy to think that a shift from moving atoms, to moving bits, is a net win for the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, moving all those bits for our sites around takes servers. And these servers run on electricity. And most of this electricity powering our servers comes from burning fossil fuels. And burning these is a key driver of climate change - the kind of disruption we don't want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what can we do? We're not going to stop sharing cat pics anytime soon, but we can change how we build online services to make them greener, load faster, and convert better, by borrowing techniques from web performance optimisation and containerisation, as well as good old common sense.

What does this mean for the way we build digital services as djangonaugs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll explore what we can, and should be doing as professional technologists in a climate emergency, the patterns emerging for more sustainable software engineering, and what a django designed to be the best choice for building future climate tech services might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

Jupyter’s great for sharing reproducible analysis. Altair’s great for making analysis interactive, and easier to understand visually. Here’s how to use them all together.
For a large part of last year, I was working in a small, cross disciplinary team in a business information company, building data products to help make sense of public spending data.
Our shared language across the team was python, and over the year, we came up with a workflow that let our analysts and data science specialists work with Jupyter notebook to carry out analysis, and build interactive data viz using Altair to explore data, before taking the same code used to generate these charts, and incorporate them in the main django app as data products for our customers.
This talk outlines why these tools are useful together, explaining how Altair packages up some of the most recent advances in thinking about data vizualisation techniques, and makes them accessible to python developers for exploratory analysis of data using Jupyter and Django together.
We’ll finish by showing how, once you’re happy with them, you can then integrate these same interactive visualisations into an existing django application, and make them accessible to your users.&lt;/p&gt;

it’s easy to think that a shift from moving atoms, to moving bits, is

&lt;p&gt;So, what can we do? We’re not going to stop sharing cat pics anytime
soon, but we can change how we build online services to make them
greener, load faster, and convert better, by borrowing existing
techniques from web performance optimisation, containerisation, and
serverless, as well as good old common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will show how we can use the tools in the python
developer's toolbox today for more planet-friendly, sustainable web
development, and how this is also good engineering practice.&lt;/p&gt;
