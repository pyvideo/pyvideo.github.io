&lt;p&gt;Over the past 5 years Machine Learning, Big Data and Data Science have
become popular in finance, with jobs postings requiring these skills
rising dramatically. However, the financial industry, like any other, is
prone to fads. This year I have undertaken a research piece
investigating whether Machine Learning models can outperform a model
derived using 'traditional' time series prediction techniques (in this
case an ARIMA model) and whether Machine Learning can provide an analyst
with any additional insights into what could be driving trends observed
in financial time series data. The latter suggesting that Machine
Learning is another tool in the analyst's tool kit to be used alongside
traditional methods rather than a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
