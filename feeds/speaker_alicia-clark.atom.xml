Unfortunately, calculations in spreadsheets are ill-equipped for code reuse, handling complex data, scaling calculations, and sharing with program literate collaborators. We explore the extent to which non-programmer scientists benefit from a spreadsheet system under development, SciSheets, in which: python is the formula language; spreadsheets can be exported as a standalone python program to enhance scalability and code reuse; and nested tables are provided to organize complex data. The talk will discuss case studies from plant genetics and coevolution of microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
