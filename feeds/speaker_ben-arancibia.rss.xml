First slowly, then all at once. GSK started the transition of using R for its clinical trial data analysis in 2020 and now uses R for our regulatory-reviewed outputs. The AccelerateR Team, an agile pod of R experts and data scientists, rotates through GSK Biostatistics study teams sitting side by side to answer questions and mentor during this transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will share our experience from AccelerateR and how other organizations can use our learnings to scale R from pilots to full enterprise adoption and contribute to open source industry R packages.&lt;/p&gt;
