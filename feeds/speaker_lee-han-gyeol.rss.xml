I hope that this presentation will go beyond sharing my experience and make you, the prospective Pythonistas, even more interested in Python and ask, “Wow? You can do this with Python, too?” I will introduce five meaningful projects that I have done with Python during my school days, along with the story of how I first encountered Python, through my stagnation, and then encountering libraries. The projects I will introduce are a class subject desktop reminder, an AI reporting chatbot, a quick route finder within the school, a meal application confirmation program, and an unmanned borrowing/return machine at the school library. I will share the results and production process of each project, as well as the changes in the surroundings as a result, along with the project introduction. I learned Python and applied it to my life. I was proud of myself for growing as I did so. How about you also try your hand at doing anything with Python? Do Anything with Python!&lt;/p&gt;
