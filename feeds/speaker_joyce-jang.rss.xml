And as anyone who as worked on a team knows, there’s often a lot more that goes into working together to build that product than actually just building the product itself. A highly functional team is not as elusive it may seem. Software engineering is a skill we’ve developed, but even more importantly software engineering on teams is another skill we’ve been practicing and improving on as an industry. Software engineering principles and best practices may seem to have very little to do with teamwork, but being able to thoughtfully apply some of what we’ve learned as engineers towards teamwork, we can help move towards creating such success with our teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As developer tools increase in power, the systems we’re able to build do too. However, with great power comes great...complexity, and the systems we build today are more complex than ever before. This talk is about reducing the complexity of your web infrastructure, and making it easier for developers on your team to learn, use, and manage your infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
