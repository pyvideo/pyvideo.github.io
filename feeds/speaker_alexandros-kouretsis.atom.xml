Add to this that their process involves linking together different computing systems and software, and integrating dynamically changing reference data, and for sure, you have a problem.

&lt;p&gt;Here is where Posit Connect along with the vast R ecosystem comes to save the day, allowing the creation of reproducible pipelines. I will share with you my first-hand experience in this presentation. In particular, how we used Targets in Posit Connect combined with AWS technologies in a bioinformatics pipeline. The result? An effective and secure workflow orchestration that is scalable and advances knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
