For example how can one best overcome the classic trade-off between quality and cost of production, when the monetary value of quality is not defined? In this gentle introduction to multi-objective optimisation you will learn about Pareto Fronts and how they can be used to optimise for multiple objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a data driven decision maker you will learn the advantages and shortcomings of the technique and be able to assess applicability for your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyCon AU is the national conference for the Python programming community, bringing together professional, student and enthusiast developers, sysadmins and operations folk, students, educators, scientists, statisticians, and many others besides, all with a love for working with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon AU informs the country’s Python developers with presentations, tutorials and panel sessions by experts and core developers of Python, as well as the libraries and frameworks that they rely on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimising for multiple objectives is a non-trivial task, especially when they are in conflict. For example how can one best overcome the classic trade-off between quality and cost of production, when the monetary value of quality is not defined? In this hands-on Python tutorial you will learn about Pareto Fronts and use them to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-Objective Optimisation, also known as Pareto Optimisation, is a method to optimise for multiple parameters simultaneously. When applicable, this method provides better results than the common practice of combining multiple parameters into a single parameter heuristic. The reason for this is quite simple. The single heuristic approach is like horse binders limiting the view of the solution space, whereas Pareto Optimisation enables a bird’s eye view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real world applications span from supply chain management, manufacturing, aircraft design to land use planning. For example when developing therapeutics, Pareto optimisation may help a biologist maximise protein properties like effectiveness and manufacturability while simultaneously minimising toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will provide a git repository with Jupyter notebooks with which you will apply lessons and tools learned to the simple Knapsack problem. Here you will program for filling a bag with packages with the objective of minimising the bag weight while maximising its content value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My objective is for you to gain a basic intuition for the technique, understand its advantages and shortcomings to be able to assess applicability for your own projects&lt;/p&gt;
