&lt;p&gt;Speaker: Koushik Krishnan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Koushik and I am an engineer at Microsoft. I work on distributed database systems and believe it or not, I use a lot of Python to build tools to so. I believe Python can help us make complicated software systems easier to operate and more performant as a result. When I am not coding I like to play disc golf and try speed-running my favorite video games.&lt;/p&gt;
