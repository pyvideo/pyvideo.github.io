These changes would have been unthinkable 30 years ago when I started working at Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll consider the drivers for these changes, how open-source tools can help achieve this, and why collaboration across the industry is vital to achieving this goal. I'll contrast this with my experience of 30 years working in the pharma industry - when the R language had only just been released, when the internet was new, and when submissions to agencies were printed out, loaded onto trucks, and shipped to their doors.&lt;/p&gt;
