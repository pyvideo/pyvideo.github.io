Unlike traditional APMs on the market, it focuses on the quality of the data it collects, rather than its quantity, in order to make sure developers know quickly what they can do to fix issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how developers can see in real-time how end-user perceive the performance of an application, and the several levels through which Blackfire can drill down in order to find the root cause of issues.
We’ll see how Blackfire can be used within CI/CD or any testing pipeline, to prevent issues from being released to production.
And we’ll see how Blackfire can be used on a development machine to reproduce and analyze issues, as well as validate code iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
