to derive useful insights from social graphs using Python, and discuss
some lessons learned from taking this analysis out of the lab and into
to a useful product in a production setting. I will cover acquiring
data, predicting influence or activity, recommending possible friends
from the graph and detecting communities within large networks.
Experience with tools used to do this, including sklearn, networkx,
Spark and Kafka will be covered.&lt;/p&gt;
