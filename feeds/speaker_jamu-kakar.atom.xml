&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storm is an object relational mapper for SQL databases, with builtin
support for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite. It was designed and
implemented as part of the Landscape project at Canonical in mid-2006
and was open sourced in mid-2007. Since then it's been used in a variety
of projects, in production for many years, and has received numerous
enhancements and bug fixes. The features of Storm will be explained with
a series of examples and with discussion about what's happening in each
one. In addition to describing the concepts and features that a
developer needs to understand, a variety of best practices will be
shared, to help developers make the best use of Storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples in this talk assume that participants have a good
understanding of SQL, transactions, relationships between tables and
other common database concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
