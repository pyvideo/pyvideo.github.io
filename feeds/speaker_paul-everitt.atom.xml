&lt;p&gt;Description
Elected as prescribed in PEP 8017, the Python Steering Council is a 5-person committee that assumes a mandate to maintain the quality and stability of the Python language and CPython interpreter, improve the contributor experience, formalize and maintain a relationship between the Python core team and the PSF, establish decision making processes for Python Enhancement Proposals, seek consensus among contributors and the Python core team, and resolve decisions and disputes in decision making among the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will be moderated by , Paul Everitt (Python Software Foundation), to introduce a discussion with members of the community. Barry Warsaw (Steering Council), Łukasz Langa (3.8 Release Manager), Emily Morehouse (Core Dev), Benjamin Peterson (2.7 Release Manager)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Barry Warsaw: Barry Warsaw is a Sr. Staff Engineer with LinkedIn, working on the Python Foundation team. He has been a core Python developer since the first workshop at NIST in 1994. As the first non-Dutch contributor, he's been dubbed Python's Terry Gilliam. In 2009, he became the FLUFL (Friendly Language Uncle For Life) via the humorous PEP 401. Today, he is one of 5 members of the Python Steering Council, helping to provide leadership for the future of Python.Barry has served as Python Release Manager, Jython project leader, and GNU Mailman project leader. He served as co-chair of the Pycon Language Summit for 4 years. He currently mentors new contributors on their journeys to becoming core developers. Outside of Python, Barry is a semi-pro bass player, and studies tai chi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Peterson: Creator of six (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six"&gt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six&lt;/a&gt;), a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library. Release manager for Python 2.6 and 2.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Morehouse: Emily Morehouse-Valcarcel is the Director of Engineering at Cuttlesoft, a digital product agency focused on creating beautifully designed software. Her passion is driven by a blend of empathy, strategy, curiosity, and human-centered design. She's a Python Core Developer, avid OSS contributor, and constant learner focused on building tools to automate the mundane and shed light on the complexity of the human experience. Emily holds degrees in Computer Science, Criminology, and Theatre from Florida State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukasz Langa: ambv on Github. Python core developer, Python 3.8 release manager, creator of Black, pianist, dad. Likes analog modular synthesizers, immersive single-player role playing games (Fallout, Elder Scrolls), and single malt Scotch whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a powerful, mature system for generating static content -- not just docs, but blogs and regular websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sphinx can also be customized and extended in various ways, and here the trip gets wild and wooly. With such a venerable software stack, Sphinx can be inscrutable when you paint outside the lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk gives Sphinx civilians confidence to go beyond simply using Sphinx, towards adapting Sphinx to their needs: configuration values, local CSS and templates, installing extensions and themes, writing a small extension with a directive, and testing that extension. We’ll conclude with a roundup of challenges and benefits that come with diving into Sphinx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the talk provides shallow treatment of a wide topic list, follow-up and hands-on instruction will be given at an open space.&lt;/p&gt;

When paired with an IDE, testing gets a visual interface, making it much easier to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we cover “visual testing”: starting, learning, using, and mastering test-driven development (TDD) with the help of a nice UI. We’ll show PyCharm Community Edition, a free and open-source Python IDE, as a productive TDD environment for pytest. Specifically, we’ll show a workflow using pytest and PyCharm that helps make tests speed up development, or at the very least help to make testing seem less &amp;quot;in the way&amp;quot; of other development activities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building open source communities is hard, and while there are best practices and lessons learned to study, sometimes it all seems random. Python became renowned for its community. What was it like in the beginning, and how did it succeed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers the 1994 Python workshop at NIST. I was fortunate to be there, along with twenty-ish others, and was involved in the next number of years of stumbling around purposefully. The stories are funny to pass along, some of the lessons are accidentally valuable, and with a generous question-and-answer period, the session becomes a community chit-chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ever heard of it recently? Being a leader, then not,
in a large open source project over a long period of time generates a
lot of funny stories. And mistakes. And even, moments of wonder, not
always intentionally. In this talk I'll cover a number of insider
stories from the life of Zope and Plone, then analyze them from the
safety of perspective. The long view can help show what makes a big
project vary in success over time measured in decades. I will also
include stories and lessons from long-running, successful leaders in
other Python projects.&lt;/p&gt;
