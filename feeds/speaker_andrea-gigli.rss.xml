Recommendation Systems in Banking</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-italia-2017/let-the-music-play-recommendation-systems-in-banking.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robot advisory is a hot topic in Banking and Finance nowadays. The
quality of any Robot relies on its ability to anticipate the choices of
customers and engage them toward an action. For this reason
recommendation systems are gaining ground in banking sector as an

Python using two different ideas, one inspired by graph theory, and the
other by item embedding.&lt;/p&gt;
