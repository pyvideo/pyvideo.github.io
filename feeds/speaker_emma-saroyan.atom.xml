&lt;p&gt;What if I told you can automatically generate your test data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may sound difficult to your traditional testing approach but can be easily done with Hypothesis, the Python library used for property-based testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an introductory talk about property-based testing. The talk requires some previous knowledge about testing to make the most out of it but if you are new and curious I think you would get something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk approaches a simple problem from two different testing perspectives. Giving you an idea about property-based testing and how it’s different from the traditional approach with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main focus of the topic would be Hypothesis and how you can achieve your testing goals with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this talk you would have a solid understanding of property-based testing with Hypothesis, that would help you decide which testing approach fits your need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Given below is a rough overview of the talk structure:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The testing problem.
The traditional approach.
Cons of traditional approach.
What property-based testing.
Intro to Hypothesis.
Same problem solution with Hypothesis.
Why choose Hypothesis as a go-to property based testing tool.
Parameterized testing with Pytest vs Hypothesis approach.
When or when not to use property based testing.
How you can adopt &lt;cite&gt;hypothesis&lt;/cite&gt; in your code base.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
