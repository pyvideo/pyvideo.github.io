&lt;p&gt;This is an introductory talk about property-based testing. The talk requires some previous knowledge about testing to make the most out of it but if you are new and curious I think you would get something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk approaches a simple problem from two different testing perspectives. Giving you an idea about property-based testing and how it’s different from the traditional approach with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main focus of the topic would be Hypothesis and how you can achieve your testing goals with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this talk you would have a solid understanding of property-based testing with Hypothesis, that would help you decide which testing approach fits your need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given below is a rough overview of the talk structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The testing problem - This is where you would explain the problem statement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The traditional approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cons of traditional approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is property-based testing ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intro to Hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same problem solution with Hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why choose Hypothesis as a go-to property based testing tool ?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parametrized testing with Pytest vs Hypothesis approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When or when not to use property based testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you adopt &lt;cite&gt;hypothesis&lt;/cite&gt; in your code base ? Some opinions here.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
