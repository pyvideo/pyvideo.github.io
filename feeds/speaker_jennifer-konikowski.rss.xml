group? What’s the best way to help people who are just getting started
with Django and Python? Are you finding it difficult to attract and keep
a diverse audience? Since I started PyLadies Boston in 2013, I’ve
learned a few lessons about the best way to help out beginners and
cultivate a welcoming community for marginalized folks. In this talk, I
will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting a group with the intention to be beginner-friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a welcoming environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beginner friendly meeting topics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding the best way to teach people to code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a good ally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will benefit anyone who is currently running or thinking of
starting a user group.&lt;/p&gt;
