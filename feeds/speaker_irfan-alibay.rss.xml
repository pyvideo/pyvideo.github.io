With over 200 contributors and 18 years of development, MDAnalysis has established a mature, stable API and a broad user community. Here we present the current status of the libraryâ€™s capabilities as it approaches its next major release. We also detail ongoing work to address modern challenges in the ever-evolving landscape of molecular simulation, such as handling increasingly large simulation datasets and meeting the tenets of FAIR.&lt;/p&gt;
