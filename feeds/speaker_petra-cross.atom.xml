projects waste $60-$70 billion per year. For that money, you could
launch the space shuttle 100 times, build and deploy the entire 24
satellite GPS, and develop the Boeing 777 from scratch and still have
few billion left over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I will not be analyzing what other companies do wrong.
Instead, I will focus on explaining what Google does to reduce the
development cost while speeding up releases and constantly delivering
high-quality software to our users. I will touch upon various software
development workflow methodologies and then dive into the specifics of
what software teams at Google do on a day- to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
