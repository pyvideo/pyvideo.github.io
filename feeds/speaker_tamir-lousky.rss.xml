An essential part of data science is data visualization, something easily achieved with popular plotting library Matplotlib. While matplotlib is powerful and versatile, R has one advantage with respect to plotting: ggplot2, which easily generates beautiful charts out of the box. In this talk we will demonstrate how to painlessly generate eye candy charts with Matplotlib, using styles, color maps, full chart customization and clever subplotting with figures and axis objects. We'll also briefly discuss basic and advanced interactivity for Jupyter notebooks and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

One of these is the open source 3D animation program Blender, which has a powerful python API that can be extended with any python library. At Invertex, we use this tool to automatically analyze 3D scans and generate custom products, in some cases ready for 3D printing. This talk will provide a short overview of Blender and its python API, and demonstrate how to use it with a few short examples.&lt;/p&gt;
