to get in touch with computer programming concepts and to link computer
science with other disciplines like Math, Geometry, Physics, Chemistry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My presentation is focused mainly on my teaching experience in a high
school using VPython. I've posed some problems to my students to solve
with VPython: from basic static building representations like castle to
more complex dynamic models like bouncing balls. This approach seems a
good way to get in touch with computer programming concepts and to link
computer science with other disciplines like Math, Geometry, Physics,
Chemistry&lt;/p&gt;
