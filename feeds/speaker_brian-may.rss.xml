and projects on HPC clusters. It is being used in production in a number
of sites across Australia. This talk will discuss turning a messy legacy
software base into a modern software platform that is much a cleaner
mess (&amp;quot;gardening&amp;quot;). I will also talk about some of the lessons learnt
along the way, including things that went well, and things that could
have been handled better.&lt;/p&gt;
