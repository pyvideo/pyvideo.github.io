astronomy community. Whether it is performing radiative transfer
calculations in a protoplanetary disk or interpreting observed spectra
in the solar corona, observers and modelers alike rely heavily on vast
amounts of detailed atomic data. These databases, which contain data
from both laboratory experiments and large simulation codes, are often
difficult to access, have no common format, and require a great deal of
effort (and funding) to assemble. One such example is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chiantidatabase.org/"&gt;CHIANTI
atomic database&lt;/a&gt; which has been maintained continuously since 1995 and
is heavily used by solar physicists. Recently I’ve begun work on a
package called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wtbarnes/fiasco"&gt;fiasco&lt;/a&gt; (the Italian name for the style of bottle used
to store a Chianti wine) which provides a high-level interface to the
CHIANTI database. In this talk, I’ll discuss the difficulties of working
with this data, the software and techniques used to parse the data, and
the high-level interface. Additionally, and most importantly, I will
discuss the possible use of fiasco as a general interface to any atomic
database and how this might extend the usefulness of the package into
the general astronomy community. My hope is that this last point in
particular will generate much discussion and interest in how to improve
programmatic interfaces to this type of data.&lt;/p&gt;
