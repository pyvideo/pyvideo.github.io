using embedding word representations from a large corpus of
unlabelled data. This allows to expand the knowledge base graph and
extract complex semantic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting knowledge graphs completion is a recent paradigm that allow
extraction of new relations (facts) from existing knowledge graphs like
Freebase or GeneOntology. Word embeddings represents each entity into a
low dimensional space and the relationships as vectorial transformations
which has the advantage of making the search space continuous. This
allows to encode the entities and transformations with global
information from the entire graph. On the other hand, word embedding
approaches, like word2vec, extracted from unlabeled text allows
representations of words as vectors, although it doesn't allow to
extract relationships . By careful alignment of entities from free text
with a knowledge graph it is possible to combine both approaches and
jointly extract new knowledge through relationships between entities and
words / phrases. We will show results from applying this technology to
biomedical data.&lt;/p&gt;
