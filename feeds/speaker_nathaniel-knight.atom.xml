Alas, we’re into Python, where packaging and distribution is not so straightforward. We’ve got sources, distributions, eggs, wheels, native integration - it’s not easy or obvious what you’re supposed to be doing, or even what the options are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about packaging and distributing Python code. It will cover the ecosystem's challenges, the general approaches to solving them, a brief history of major tools, finishing with an overview of the tools that working Pythonistas are likely to encounter in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
