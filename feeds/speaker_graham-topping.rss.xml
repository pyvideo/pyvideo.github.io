Over the years, Graham has built, led and managed teams from 5 to 100 as a founder, manager, executive and board member. He has a passion for solving complex problems by creating fun, inclusive, high performing teams. In previous lives, he’s built multi-petabyte systems, found homes for lost cats and puppies, done stand up comedy at weddings and night clubs (including an unfortunately momentous poetry jam) and taken himself far too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
