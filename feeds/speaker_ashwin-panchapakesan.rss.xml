been around since the mid 1950s. Since then, a lot of study has been
done on these algorithms, using them to solve various different types of
problems. While many frameworks exist to help develop and run
evolutionary algorithms, mine is aimed at simplicity for the user to
create a program to execute an evolutionary algorithm&lt;/p&gt;
