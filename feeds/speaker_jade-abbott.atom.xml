But what happens when we need to train a model to do a customer facing task, that we trust enough to deploy to a production system? And how do we get that model into production and maintain it once it is there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk aims to share some of the struggles, trade-offs and strategies from the trenches of training and building the infrastructure for a complex deep learning model for production use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is aimed at tech leads and developers who are interested in machine learning and are working on training their own models that they'd like to deploy&lt;/p&gt;
