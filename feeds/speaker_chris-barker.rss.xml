including compiled extensions. Fortunately, it is getting easier thanks
to efforts in the scientific Python community. However, there are still
a lot of challenges and complexities facing the package builder.There
are at least two major packaging systems (pip/wheel and conda), and lots
of different ways to do work with these systems. This tutorial will
cover packaging from start to finish for both PyPI and conda, including
setup.py, flit, wheels, twine, conda-build, scikit-build, anaconda
cloud, and conda-forge. Particular attention will be paid to critical
details, such as binary compatibility and platform
differences.Presenter(s): Speaker: Michael Sarahan, Anaconda, Inc.
