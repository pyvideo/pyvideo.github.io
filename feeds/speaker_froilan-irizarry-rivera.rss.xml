&lt;p&gt;Over the years I've worked in Puerto Rico as a consultant and developer while contributing to the creation of a couple of tech communities in the San Juan metro area. The latest being Fullstack Nights and Code for Puerto Rico&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016 I moved to Washington DC to join the United States Digital Service. Afterwards I stayed in the city to join Code.gov as a tech lead and later GitHub where I helped the Dept. of Veterans Affairs in their digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently working with Uplight, Inc. as a senior engineer on their platform team, where we are building the APIs to help transform the energy industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While essentially a blog, I'm going to be using this space as a place to record thoughts, ideas, and have a place where I can save things that I don't want to forget. You'll see posts in English, Spanish, and &amp;quot;Spanglish&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for being here and I hope you enjoy this ride with me.&lt;/p&gt;
