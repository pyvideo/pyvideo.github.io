We define the space of a module's allowed behavior to be its &amp;quot;behavioral

eases maintenance and makes APIs delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

number of web applications to off load tasks that can be executed
asynchronously. This workshop will demonstrate how we can use Celery for
a use case that isn't a web site or a web application and is something
which could happen in a hospital or a bank or any other such large
organization.&lt;/p&gt;

experience, but what if someone is learning Python and Django with a
HTML/CSS background? This tutorial focuses on the web-based features of
Django — templates and the admin — and goes over the basic building
blocks of Django programming to get web designers excited and interested
in learning more.&lt;/p&gt;

remember the community with a fondness that likely doesn't accurately
reflect the former reality. We'll explore how we can take a set of
articles from an online community and winnow out the stuff we feel is
unworthy. We'll explore some of the machine learning tools that are just
a &amp;quot;pip install&amp;quot; away, such as scikit-learn and nltk.&lt;/p&gt;

good constructs for fan-out (one thread spawns others) and fan-in (many
threads join together). This talk will show examples of fan-in and
fan-out. It will cover the successes and shortcomings of APIs that
provide concurrency. Finally, we'll discuss how the async model of
Tulip/PEP3156 is the ultimate API. The future is bright!&lt;/p&gt;

in a simpler, leaner way. In this tutorial session you will follow me as

problems involving iteration and data flow. However, one of their more
powerful uses is in customizing various aspects of program control flow.
In this tutorial, we'll look at some more exotic uses of generators such
as writing context managers, inlining callback functions, eliminating
recursion, implementing actors, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

We'll look at the problem - code sharing and reuse across modules - and
different ways we could solve it. We'll come up with &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; from
parallel universes and then reinvent python's actual implementation.
Finally, we'll import - using python's design - without using the
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
