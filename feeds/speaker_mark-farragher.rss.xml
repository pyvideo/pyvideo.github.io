I discuss how I developed a Python package that enabled me to become more effective at learning at university and built a knowledge graph of 500+ notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software has emerged in the last few years, such as Roam Research and Obsidian.md, for writing notes in a highly-connected format.  These apps can display notes in an extensive knowledge graph and have enabled a new wave of personal knowledge management (PKM) for the digital age.  This talk provides an introduction to personal knowledge management and shows how I used Python to improve my learning through my Obsidiantools package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my MPhil programme in Health Data Science at the University of Cambridge in 2021-22, I wrote all my notes as markdown files through Obsidian.md.  I developed the Obsidiantools package for analysing Obsidian.md vaults, in order to improve my Obsidian workflows and analyse my notes via the Python data science stack, NLP packages and NetworkX.  Within 3 months, I had written over 65k words in 250+ notes and used network analysis through the Python data stack to improve my strategy for studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connected notes even go back hundreds of years in an analogue format, through the use of index cards and Zettelkasten systems.  In a more modern form, digital note vaults are at the intersection of NLP and network analysis, so there are data science challenges to tackle in those domains (Roam Research even offers a $150k prize for one of those challenges, in case you are tempted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk structure:
- Introduction to personal knowledge management (PKM)
- My MPhil notes as connected notes
- The Obsidiantools package
- Data science challenges and wrap-up&lt;/p&gt;

This talk is a primer on causal inference: what is it, why is it important and how can we apply it to projects?&lt;/p&gt;
