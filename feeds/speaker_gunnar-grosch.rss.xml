But in recent years, there has been new processes and tooling towards using configuration post-deployment, in the form of feature flags, operational config, or other runtime configuration. Continually adjusting the configuration to update and tune your code in production is a powerful, fast, and safe way to deploy value to customers. Join us in a discussion about how Amazon uses Continuous Configuration tools at scale to move fast and ensure maximum availability of our services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Includes Python-based demo of how continuous configuration can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
