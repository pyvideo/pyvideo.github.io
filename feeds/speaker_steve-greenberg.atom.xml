We will cover the basics of Earth Engine data types and how to visualize, analyze, and export Earth Engine data in a Jupyter environment using geemap. We will also demonstrate how to develop and deploy interactive Earth Engine web apps. Throughout the session, practical examples and hands-on exercises will be provided to enhance learning. The attendees should have a basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Familiarity with Earth science and geospatial datasets is not required, but will be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
