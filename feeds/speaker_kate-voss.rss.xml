tooltips, and helper text than to search for documentation. But these
bits of microcopy are actually an opportunity to communicate and connect
with users when they most need it. Most errors say that something went
wrong, but the user doesn''t know if it''s their fault or what to do
about it. As writers, designers, and developers, we need to help them
fix the problem and teach them what to do next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microcopy is also a chance to create a friendly relationship and
establish your brand with your audience. Users are less likely to get
frustrated if the error message has a personal and human sentiment than
if it merely says &amp;quot;ACCESS DENIED&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;FORBIDDEN ACTION&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I show how making error message Humble, Human, and Helpful
is critical to making your users Happy. We''ll laugh at a few bad
errors, and learn from the good error messages and microcopy.&lt;/p&gt;
