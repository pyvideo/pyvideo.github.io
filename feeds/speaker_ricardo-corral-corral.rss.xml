structures and some practical applications and state of the art
results on task like structural and functional classification, decoy
identification, and fast finding of neighboring structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins are the most abundant macromolecules on cells. They perform a
wide range of biological activities due to its adopted three dimensional
structures. First requirement to make use of Machine Learning
technologies on this context, is to construct an informative set of
features for representing protein structures. We make use of the Residue
Cluster Class System, a labeled Sperner Family arising from atomic
positions, giving a total set of 26 features. Practical applications are
presented for various classical computational biology tasks. Entire code
base is implemented on Python as an API and ready to use final user
programs.&lt;/p&gt;
