analysis. They are often pitted against each other in pros and cons
lists, where users feel forced to pick just one. Each has unique
advantages, and it's now easier than ever to use them harmoniously.
Python or R? Why not both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often do you hear the question &amp;quot;Python or R?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspiring analytics professionals often feel the need to choose &amp;amp; learn a
'one size fits all' language for their scripting work. There are many
cases, though, where a specific library in Python or R is more effective
than similar libraries in the other language. This can lead to some
painful tradeoffs when selecting a single language for your work. Great
news: recent developments have made leveraging both languages in the
same workflow easier than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, weâ€™ll present methods for leveraging R from directly
within Python environments (and vice versa). We will illustrate the use
of these methods by using popular libraries to execute common analytics
tasks across languages without switching development environments.&lt;/p&gt;
