&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RestFS is an experimental project to develop an open-source
distributed filesystem for large environments. It is designed to scale
up from a single server to thousand of nodes and delivering a high
availability storage system with special features for high i/o
performance and network optimization for work better in WAN environment.
The Restfs is pure-python, but several of the libraries that it depends
upon use C extensions (sometimes for speed, sometimes to interface to
pre-existing C libraries). The Project is on the beginning stage, with
some technology previews released. The main characteristics of the
RestFS are : - Scalability, no limits on storage and clients size - High
availability, no single point of failure and data replication -
Adaptative, load balancing and uniform distribution - High Performance,
parallel transfer, local cache consistency , data transfer by difference
- Flexible, S3 compatibility interface, dedicated library for
integration in web server and application layer This talk describes the
architecture, internals of RestFS and comparison among different free
software solutions. The session will discuss our experience in this
development and detailed information on performance and scalability
