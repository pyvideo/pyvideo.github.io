When a website falls over, pagers go off, and engineers burst into action to bring a site back to life.  Postmortems are written, and teams develop strategies to prevent similar failures in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the reliability of our data? Would _you_ trust financial reports built on your data?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not, what can you do to improve data health? If you _would_ trust these reports, how can you prove to customers, investors, and auditors alike that they should too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you’ll learn to apply strategies from the world of dev-ops to data. You’ll learn about questions auditors ask that can help you pinpoint data problems. You’ll also learn some accounting-specific tools for accurate and timely record keeping that I’ve found fascinating and helpful!&lt;/p&gt;
