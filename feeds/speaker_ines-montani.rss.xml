Platforms are steadily
becoming more mature, useful tools are released almost daily and things
that seemed hopelessly futuristic only a few years ago are suddenly
commercially viable. Despite this, the software world is awash with
bullshit. The success of the largest technology companies has led to a
very skewed set of lessons. This narrow focus is amplified by the
venture capital industry and the fact that nobody really knows what’s
going to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, none of this actually matters. The basics of creating
something useful and selling it for money remain the same. In this talk,
I’m not going to give you “one weird trick” or tell you to ~* just
follow your dreams *~. But I’ll share some of the things we’ve learned
from building a successful software company around commercial developer
tools and our open- source library spaCy.&lt;/p&gt;

Prototyping has never been easier, but not all prototypes give a smooth path to production. In this talk, I'll share the most important lessons we've learned from solving real-world information extraction problems in industry, and show you a new approach and mindset for designing robust and modular NLP pipelines in the age of Generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking down larger business problems into actionable machine learning tasks is one of the central challenges of applied natural language processing. I will walk you through example applications and practical solutions, and show you how to use LLMs to their fullest potential, how and where to integrate your custom business logic and how to maximize efficiency, transparency and data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
