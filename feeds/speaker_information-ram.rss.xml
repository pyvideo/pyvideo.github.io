Since its release in 2018, there is a new web framework that has been rapidly gaining popularity among developers.
It is called FastAPI. It was introduced at PyCon.
I think many of you have experienced it at least once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will look at the differences between existing Django, Flask, and FastAPI.
And as the name suggests, we will look at the architecture with a focus on how FastAPI was able to achieve &amp;quot;Fast.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

I give various lectures in the infrastructure field. I am interested in developing fast, stable, and highly productive code, and I am honored to be given the opportunity to introduce FastAPI.&lt;/p&gt;
