Just releasing software is not enough - it needs good documentation, automated testing, and encourage contributions from others. Interacting with the astronomy python community has shown me that it is now better for my career to make all my code public. As one illustration, I will use the dust_extinction package that I started after the 2016 meeting. This package provides dust extinction curves using the astropy affiliated template package and is based on the astropy modeling and units packages.&lt;/p&gt;
