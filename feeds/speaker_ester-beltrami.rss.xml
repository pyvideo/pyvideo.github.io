&lt;p&gt;How annoying is to find out that everything went to hell on the pipeline
because you forgot to run the formatters? Be smart and learn how to set
up automations! Have you ever been in the situation where you check the
pipeline to see if it has finished and you discover it didn’t even start
because you forgot to run formatters and linters locally? or when the
code you’re reading isn’t formatted properly and you’re dying to stop
doing everything you’re doing and fix it once for all this crap? There
are wonderful tools out there to avoid this problem, that runs every
commit or push so you don’t forget anymore! Learn how to configure them
for your needs and more importantly learn why you need them now!!&lt;/p&gt;
