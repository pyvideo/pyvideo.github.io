&lt;p&gt;Presented by Tobias Ivarsson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Databases that employ a data model other than the relational model are
increasingly a hot topic. Neo4j is an open source database where the
data model is a graph. Data in Neo4j is stored as Nodes and
Relationships in between nodes. A lot of the data we model in
applications every day is actually graph oriented, having a database
that persists such data natively is a huge benefit. In this presentation
we will see how to use Neo4j in Python, and demonstrate this with a web
application in Django.&lt;/p&gt;
