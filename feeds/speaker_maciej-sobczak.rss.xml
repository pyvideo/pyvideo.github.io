But most importantly armed with the knowledge about the deep learning we will address the questions about the nature of what's learnable, learnablity of the world around us and finally using the findings of computer science we will try to understand the way our brains learn and how one can leverage that knowledge to improve one's own learning habits and the way learning process could be organised to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
