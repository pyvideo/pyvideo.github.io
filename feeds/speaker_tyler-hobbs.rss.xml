This
will give a high level introduction to Cassandra and its data model; it
will detail the features of pycassa, the Python client library for
Cassandra, and how to interact with Cassandra through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being non-relational, Cassandra's data model is fundamentally different
from that of a relational database. In addition, it uses an RPC based
API rather than a query language. On top of that, Cassandra is a
distributed database, so the client must be aware of and interact with
multiple nodes in the cluster. All of these attributes of Cassandra make
the client libraries a different experience. Fortunately, the Python
client library is the easiest way to use Cassandra. This talk will start
with a high level overview of the clustering model of Cassandra then its
data model. A large portion of the talk will cover the pycassa methods
that interact with the data model of Cassandra, i.e. inserting,
fetching, and removing data. A small amount of time will be dedicated to
describing connection pooling in pycassa -- how it handles node
failures, distributes requests, etc. The final 10 minutes will be
devoted to Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;
