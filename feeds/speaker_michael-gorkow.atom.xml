With the introduction of Snowflake's Snowpark for Python, Python developers can now collaborate and build on one platform with a secure Python sandbox, providing developers with dynamic scalability &amp;amp; elasticity as well as security and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll explain the core concepts of Snowpark for Python and how they can be used for large scale feature engineering and data science.&lt;/p&gt;
