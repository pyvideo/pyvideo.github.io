It provides various Bayesian methods, such as optimization, experimental design and quadrature, in a flexible unified way that leverages their commonalities. In the talk we will explain how and why Emukit was built, what are its strengths and weaknesses, how it is used today and in what scenarios one might find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
