The platform does not limit the scope of your pipelines; you can use it to build ML models, transfer data, manage your infrastructure and more. During this presentation, Kenten will share use cases and typical integration points/workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
