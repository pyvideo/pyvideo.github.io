This talk focuses on using AI tools with Shiny for Python, demonstrating how AI can accelerate Shiny application development and enhance its capabilities. We'll also explore Shiny's unique ability to interface with AI models, offering possibilities beyond Python web frameworks like Streamlit and Dash. Learn how Shiny and AI together can empower you to do more, and do it faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel like you don’t have the time to invest in learning Shiny, this might change your mind. You’ll get up and running with Shiny in no time, and you’ll be able to learn from the AI as you go. If you already know Shiny, you’ll be able to dramatically accelerate your development process, and you’ll find yourself trying out new things that wouldn’t have been worth the effort before.&lt;/p&gt;
