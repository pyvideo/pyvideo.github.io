kinds of geospatial raster data using a productive and fun GDAL and
Numpy-based library named Rasterio. It's a new open source project from
the satellite team at Mapbox and is informed by a decade of experience
using Python and GDAL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasterio is a GDAL and Numpy-based Python library guided by lessons
learned over a decade of using GDAL and Python to solve geospatial
problems. Among these lessons: the importance of productivity,
enjoyability, and serendipity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will discuss the motivation for writing Rasterio and explain how and
why it diverges from other GIS software and embraces Python types,
protocols, and idioms. I will also explain why Rasterio adheres to some
GIS paradigms and bends or breaks others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I will show examples of using Rasterio to read, manipulate, and
write georeferenced raster data. Some examples will be familiar to users
of older Python GIS software and will illustrate how Rasterio lets you
get more done with less code and fewer bugs. I will also demonstrate fun
and useful features of Rasterio not found in other geospatial libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
