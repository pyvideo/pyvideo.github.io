Chances are that you had to
use some proprietary IDE for development. Wouldn't it be better to
use some open source IDE like Eclipse or QtCreator? What should I do
when I'm working a project and can't start from the scratch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I'll show you how Python can help you with
porting projects. I'll give examples of projects developed in IAR
Embedded Workbench and Keil uVision. At the end we'll have CMake
build file which can be imported to many IDEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python modules like Objectify and Jinja will be a great help to us!&lt;/p&gt;
