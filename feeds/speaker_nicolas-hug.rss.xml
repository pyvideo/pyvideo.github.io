We
will focus on two popular approaches: neighborhood-based methods and
matrix- factorization based techniques. We will also present Surprise,
an open source Python package for easily building and analyzing
recommendation algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, we’ll provide insights into ongoing work to accelerate exploration in multimodal understanding and generative AI using TorchMultimodal. We'll also present TorchVision's new transforms API, with added support for image detection, segmentation, and video tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

Iterable datasets can be more flexible and potentially faster than their indexable cousins. They are also much harder to use correctly, and can easily lead to silently wrong results. This talk is a quick and fun intro to some of the traps that Iterable datasets lay out for you, with some tips to help you avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

After presenting Gradient Boosting as a special kind of gradient descent, we will describe various tricks and techniques that can speed up a GBDT implementation by multiple orders of magnitude. We will also present PyGBM, a fast pure-Python implementation of GBDTs inspired by LightGBM, that leverages Numba's JIT compilation. We will also provide feedback about our extensive use of Numba.&lt;/p&gt;
