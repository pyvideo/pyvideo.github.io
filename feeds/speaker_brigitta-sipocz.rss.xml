In addition to these domain specific libraries we also maintain a suite of infrastructure packages. This infrastructure can be easily utilized to cover the needs of most scientific Python projects. Sharing the tools we developed for maintenance, testing, documenting, and general upkeep of the most essential parts of our project maximizes the impact of the software engineering expertise and resources within the whole ecosystem to ensure that others can benefit from the efforts of the core Astropy team.&lt;/p&gt;
