community. At NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we have built upon those foundations to
answer engineering challenges and prove that with innovative approaches, the use cases that
can benefit from the Jupyter ecosystem are endless. With modular extensions and novel
methods, we are able to perform system-level and physics-based modeling, trade studies,
automated pipelines of engineering reports, hardware testing procedures, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we share our experience of using Jupyter as an integration platform and multi-domain
engineering tool, and why we believe that with the correct approach, Jupyter can be extended
to do just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;
