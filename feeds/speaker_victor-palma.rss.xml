infrastructure. However because of DevOps some of us have taken a path
to move more towards a developer role. That journey can be a bit tough
specially if you don’t have the proper support in place. Fortunately for
me I had some help along the way and they gave me some direction that
has improved my development. Here is a list of small things to help you
on that journey: • Changing the way we think (mindset of a developer) •
Idiomatic python • Zen of Python by example • Testing&lt;/p&gt;
