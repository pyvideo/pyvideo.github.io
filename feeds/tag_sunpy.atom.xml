Python alternative to IDL and SolarSoft. SunPy provides unified,
coordinate-aware data objects for many common solar data types and
integrates into these plotting and analysis tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors: Mumford, Stuart, University of Sheffield / SunPy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track: Astronomy and Astrophysics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern solar physicists have, at their disposal, an abundance of space
and ground based instruments providing a large amount of data to analyse
the complex Sun every day. The NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory
satellite, for example, collects around 1.2 TB of data every 24 hours
which requires extensive reconstruction before it is ready for
scientific use. Currently most data processing and analysis for all
solar data is done using IDL and the 'SolarSoft' library. SunPy is a
project designed to provide a free, open and easy-to-use Python
alternative to IDL and SolarSoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SunPy provides unified, coordinate-aware data objects for many common
solar data types and integrates into these plotting and analysis tools.
Providing this base will give the global solar physics community the
opportunity to use Python for future data processing and analysis
routines. The astronomy and astrophysics community, through the
implementation and adoption of AstroPy and pyRAF, have already
demonstrated that Python is well suited for the analysis and processing
of space science data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we give key examples of SunPy's structure and
scope, as well as the major improvements that have taken place to
provide a stable base for future expansion. We discuss recent
improvements to file I/O and visualisation, as well as improvements to
the structure and interface of the map objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discuss the many challenges which SunPy faces if it is to achieve its
goal of becoming a key package for solar physics. The SunPy developers
hope to increase the the visibility and uptake of SunPy, and encourage
people to contribute to the project, while maintaining a high quality
code base, which is facilitated by the use of a social version control
system (git and GitHub).&lt;/p&gt;
