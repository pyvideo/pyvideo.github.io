If you’re like me, you’ve
written lots of documentation like this. We all want our products to be
simple. Worse, lots of us believe our products are simple. But trust me,
they’re not simple! Your installation guide failed on step 2, and I
don’t know how to fix it! In this talk I highlight some writing styles
which seem innocuous when written, but which show a lack of sympathy
when read. I suggest some ways to avoid these pitfalls and bridge the
gap with your reader.&lt;/p&gt;
