Gail is a
university lecturer in programming and cyberpsychology. They have had
some interesting conversations and Thomas isn’t the only one who has
learned a lot this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Thomas will share his insights into common higher
education practices which can make it harder for people like him to
learn, and why cyber security education in particular could benefit from
recognising and addressing this. Gail will reflect on where she’s got to
in her own contribution to that process and invite suggestions for doing
better.&lt;/p&gt;
