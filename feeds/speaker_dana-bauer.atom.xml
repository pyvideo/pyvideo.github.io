possible for the public to access sub-weekly and even daily imagery of
the Earth's entire landmass. In this tutorial, you will gain hands-on
experience exploring publicly-available satellite imagery and using
Python tools for geospatial and time-series analysis of medium- and
high-resolution imagery data. At the end of the workshop, you will apply
what you've learned to investigate real-world environmental and
humanitarian challenges. This tutorial is for intermediate Python
developers. It would help if learners attending this workshop also had
some familiarity with map data, but the instructors will not assume
background knowledge of satellite imagery or geo- data tools. Learners
will come away from the workshop with: - a solid understanding of
satellite imagery and geo-data concepts; - strategies for wrangling,
processing, and analyzing satellite imagery using several Python- based
open-source toolkits; - hands-on experience using satellite imagery to
better understand and address real-world challengesPresenter(s):
