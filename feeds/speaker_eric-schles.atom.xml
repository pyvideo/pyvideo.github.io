I'll use my own journey in combatting human trafficking as an example, extracting out themes from these examples. There will be technical demos throughout, showing the gallery of technical solutions I've used to try to solve this social problem. The intention is to show the audience how these solutions generalize. In doing so, the hope is, participants will be able to solve their own social issues.&lt;/p&gt;

The industry
commands 32 billion dollars in annual revenue a year (source: polaris
project). As a professor and researcher at NYU I am developing tools to
fight this horrible problem. Come learn about the work I've done so far
and where my research is going. I will be showing you how recreate some
of the tools I've made and used in python. I will be covering web
scraping, text processing, and image processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be taking folks through a number of web scraping tools that I use
to find instances of human trafficking. We will then go through
classification algorithms I use to determine genuine instances of
trafficking. Finally I will discuss image processing and facial
recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

social good. There is an increasing need for data science, automation,
search and distributed computation. In this talk I will take listeners
through a number of general purpose tools including, building a image
search database with python and a few libraries, how to build geographic
information systems with geodjango, and how to process and extract
information from pdfs.&lt;/p&gt;
