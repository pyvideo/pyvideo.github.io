Why do we need nice looking code anyway? In this talk I'll give you a tour of PEP 8 (The Style Guide for Python Code) and show you how you can force yourself to write code that looks nice.&lt;/p&gt;

How to make computer science education more interesting.</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-sk-2019/controling-a-robotic-arm-with-microbits-how-to-make-computer-science-education-more-interesting.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captivating a group of children for a sustained period of time is
notoriously hard. I will be exporing with you how the micro:bit can be
used to engage a young audience with interactive demos and programming
activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children love to physically interact with hardware. That is what is
great about the micro:bit. It not only has built in LEDs and buttons but
can also control bigger more exciting electronics like robotic arms.
This allows for setup that gives students of all ability levels a
challenge. Students that are beginners to programming can be given a
more complete program or walk throught a worksheet that takes them
through the process of controling the device (in this case a robotic
arm) step by step. Students that have higher programming skills can be
given a more bare bones / boilerplate source file and can write code to
control the arm with less guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

integration and deployment. This means that after pushing to the Git
repo, your code is tested them deployed automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this with Docker allows for fast Python deployments to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will be showing you how to setup a basic CI/CD with
GitLab. We will be making a basic Django project as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have since broadened by learning to create the connect 4 game that I hinted at creating, and then combined it with google's neural net framework (tensorflow) and a raspberry pi to add an AI opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be showing you what I learnt from developing my ideas, and how I overcame any issues I faced.&lt;/p&gt;
