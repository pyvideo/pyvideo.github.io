vision to Understand their difficulties at work and how they can
overcome those difficulties to become successful in their role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a backend Software Engineer at Yelp who uses Python extensively for
building Yelps infrastructure and internal tools. I also suffer from a
genetic disorder called Albinism which often results in limited visual
acuity that can range from 20/120 to 20/200 in most common cases. With
such a low vision it's extremely difficult to read the computer screen
without the use of on-screen magnifiers. In this talk, we will see how a
person with adverse visual acuity can thrive and be successful in the
field of Software Engineering. We will address the importance and
meaning of accessibility for Software Engineers with partial vision and
recommend some best practices that are available today. We will also
talk about the importance of an inclusive work culture that can help
foster creativity and ease ramp up for a Software Engineer with a
disability.&lt;/p&gt;
