The regions involved in concentration, impulse
control, and inhibition are smaller than usual; Like somewhere between
5% and 12% of adults I have ADHD. Even if you do not have the disorder
yourself you probably work, live or know someone who does. But the world
is not designed for people with ADHD, so to be successful I’ve had to
develop techniques to keep my concentration and procrastination in
check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll briefly look at what ADHD is and how it impairs not
only concentration but also executive function. Then we’ll explore how
changes in the workplace can benefit not just those with ADHD, but
anyone whose work requires creativity or extended periods of focus.
Next, we’ll look at some persistent myths about productivity, and what
you can do personally to increase your concentration and output without
burning out. Then I’ll present some techniques you can rollout within
your team to remove distractions while improving the quality of
communication.&lt;/p&gt;
