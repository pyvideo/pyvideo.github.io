Sometimes it
does not work well, and we visit speed test page and check internet
speed for ourselves or call cable company to report the service
failure. As a Python programmer, have you ever tried to automate the
internet speed test on a regular basis? Have you ever thought about
logging the data and analyzing the time series ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will go through the whole process of data mining and
knowledge discovery. Firstly we write a script to run speed test
periodically and log the metric. Then we parse the log data and
convert them into a time series and visualize the data for a certain
period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we conduct some data analysis; finding trends, forecasting, and
detecting anomalous data. There will be several statistic or deep
learning techniques used for the analysis; ARIMA (Autoregressive
Integrated Moving Average), LSTM (Long Short Term Memory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to provide basic idea how to run speed test and collect
metrics by automated script in Python. Also, I will provide high
level concept of the methodologies for analyzing time series data.
Also, I would like to motivate Python people to try this at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session is designed to be accessible to everyone, including
anyone with no expertise in mathematics, computer science.
Understandings of basic concepts of machine learning and some Python
tools bringing such concepts into practice might be helpful, but not
necessary for the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As software engineers work on CI/CD process as soon as they start a new project, data scientists and ML engineers define a pipeline for data as it flows through a typical workflow. Each step of the pipeline is fed data processed from its preceding step as CI/CD process starts from code changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Pipelining ML project&amp;quot; is sometimes misleading as it implies a large project with a group of engineers working on some large systems , being considered to be hard for an individual and unnecessary for a small project. Regardless of its size, having well organized pipelines for any ML projects is essential to succeed and actually it could be done easily with utilizing a proper tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will go through a machine learning workflow divided into a few steps composing a ML pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment. Each step depends on data produced by previous step, which are controlled by DVC. DVC is open-source version control system for data scientist and ML engineer helping them to organize data, models and experiments for some ML projects. The presentation will not only introduce how to use the tool but also show how to organize a ML pipeline with some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to motivate data scientists and ML engineer to start building machine learning pipeline with DVC. Audience might expect a guide to using DVC  for automating the pipeline. Also I will give some explanation about concepts of machine learning related techniques necessary for understanding the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session is designed to be accessible to everyone in beginners level. Understandings of basic concepts of machine learning and version control system (preferably, Git) might be helpful but not mandatory for the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
