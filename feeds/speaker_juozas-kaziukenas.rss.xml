Not a joke, I really did it and it worked! The final result was a well-tested piece of Python code, which could be compiled to be very performant as well. The goal of this talk is to introduce you to the basics of interpreters and the tools available in RPython to build one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how dynamic programming languages get executed I set out to build a PHP interpreter. Not a joke, I really did it and it worked! The final result was a well-tested piece of Python code, which could be compiled to be very performant as well. It's available as an open source project on github &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/juokaz/pyhp"&gt;http://github.com/juokaz/pyhp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
