We'll discuss details of wrapping a minimal REST API around scikit-learn, training and persisting models in batch, and logging decisions, then compare to some other common approaches to productionizing models.&lt;/p&gt;

We'll discuss the high-level architecture, then dive into how Simple uses Python to support its warehouse with an admin interface and data transformation tools.&lt;/p&gt;
