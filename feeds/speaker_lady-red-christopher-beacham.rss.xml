Parsing Heraldic Blazons with Python!</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2019/a-medieval-dsl-parsing-heraldic-blazons-with-python.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medieval European Nobility was obsessed with Lineage. They created a
Heraldic System to track families, which assigned each family a unique
Coat of Arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any painting of the Coat of Arms was not the official version. The
official version was a &amp;quot;Blazon&amp;quot; - a precise, terse description in
heraldic language. This heraldic language reads like English, Latin,
French, and XML had a baby. It's a fully recursive language with a
formal grammar, variable assignment, positional arguments, and also,
Lions, Bears, and Pythons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example: &lt;em&gt;Sable, on a fesse or three lions gules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we look at parsing this Medieval &lt;em&gt;Domain Specific
Language&lt;/em&gt; with Python. Along the way, we'll learn a little history, and
the tools for parsing and writing your own DSL.&lt;/p&gt;
