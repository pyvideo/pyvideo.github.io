In data engineering, developers must use a &amp;quot;Query Engine&amp;quot; to efficiently retrieve data, run data processing and then send data back out to a destination storage system or application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python API for Apache Spark (PySpark) is currently the most popular framework that most data engineers use for data engineering at large scale. However, PySpark has a heavy dependency on the JVM which causes high friction during the development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we discuss our work with the Daft Python Dataframe (www.getdaft.io) which is a distributed Python query engine built with Rust. We will perform a deep-dive into Daft architecture, and talk about how the strong synergy between Python and Rust enables key advantages for Daft to succeed as a query engine.&lt;/p&gt;
