&lt;p&gt;You have developed your first web app and you noticed that some requests take too much time for a good user experience? Celery is an option to provide a better user experience by &amp;quot;outsourcing&amp;quot; long running tasks from the initial web request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know clone, commit, push, and pull. Now you're ready for the fun stuff. This talk will give you the advanced knowledge you need to take control of your Git repository: rebase, cherry-pick, bisect, blame, squashing, and the reflog. You'll also get a better conceptual understanding of how Git works, allowing you to chain these tools together to accomplish whatever task you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the refreshing trends in software engineering has been the increase of people moving into the field later in life, from non traditional backgrounds (graduating as a 22 year old with a BS in computer science, for example). As someone who does indeed fall into that category, I want to talk about my experiences as a junior developer, after I've been working for a few years, and express my thoughts and feelings on a later in life transition to software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't code. But I do study the methods languages use to think about themselves. Python has an iterative garbage collection that moves things into increasingly &amp;quot;old&amp;quot;/irrelevant buckets, until they are re-used or deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we applied that to more than just code? What if we expanded it to my old foe, wiki pages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me for an engaging exploration of what code can teach us about documentation and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you're bored at your current job. Perhaps you're new to the tech job market. Perhaps your company lost funding and you were laid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a million reasons why, but one common element: Sometimes we all have to play the job hunt game. And the game sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From unresponsive recruiters to pointless interview questions, a job hunt can be a demoralizing and dehumanizing process, but there are a lot of things which you can do to make it more productive and less stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding the good job postings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resume and Cover Letter dos and don'ts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize Organize Organize&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You rule the interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negotiating the offer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And more!&lt;/li&gt;

The question that often remains: HOW do we make these cultures more inclusive? This talk introduces Privilege Arbitrage as a method to promote that cultural change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for people of all skill levels, interested in helping their tech community culture become more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will answer the question of what is bitcoin and the blockchain and will end with a quick tutorial on how to create a blockchain application in Flask. We will not only make a bitcoin application, but we will also reflect upon the implications of this cutting edge technology to the greater society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin and blockchain technology has been in the news as of late, such as the hard fork of Ethereum to the hack of Bitifnex. This talk will cover the basics of blockchain technology and we will learn how to build an application that accepts bitcoin. Armed with a little knowledge of Flask and REST we will be able to use Python to bridge the gap between current events and technology. As Python developers we will be able to add to the narrative of bitcoin/blockchain technology in a unique and meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is a crash course on Python performance aimed at people who have learned some Python programming and want to deepen their understanding of the language and how to get the most out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a basic level of Python is needed to understand the talk and topics will be presented clearly and succinctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Servo browser engine, written in Rust, is a Mozilla initiative to test novel approaches to rendering the web and build components to improve Firefox. This talk is a tour through the infrastructure code behind the scenes, showing how the project uses Python at every step from greeting pull requests to delivering nightly builds. You'll also learn how you can contribute to Servo with your Python skills!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intermediate python developers will learn how to build a chatbot engine that identifies bullying in chatrooms. Studies show that most free-for-all social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Twitch, Slack) unintentionally make us less kind and supportive. But there's Hope. At Hopester we've built an open source chatbot engine with an open API called Hope. We'll show you how to add Hope to your chat channels or build your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When most Python developers want to observe the execution of their program on a function-by-function, or line-by-line, basis, they tend to reach for a debugger. But, debuggers like pdb are actually built on the trace module in the standard library. In this talk for beginner and intermediate Python programmers, learn how to use trace by writing your own custom tracing functions...and also see how tools like debuggers and coverage leverage the power of trace under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
