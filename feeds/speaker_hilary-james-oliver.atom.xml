tasks. Developed for weather forecasting applications at NIWA, cylc has
since been adopted by the UK Met Office and others, and was a finalist
in the 2012 NZ Open Source Awards. Lead developer Hilary Oliver will
talk about cylc and the many advantages that the Python programming
language brought to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cylc Suite Engine is a metascheduler or workflow engine that makes
it relatively easy to construct, monitor, and control large complex
distributed suites of interdependent cycling tasks. Cylc was developed,
entirely in Python, to automate modern environmental forecasting systems
in an HPC environment at NIWA in New Zealand. Since its release as an
Open Source project on GitHub in 2011 cylc has been adopted by the UK
Met Office to control their large and varied forecasting systems; it is
also used by groups at the Marine Meteorology Division of the Naval
Research Laboratory in the US, the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology
in Germany, and others; and it was a finalist in the 2012 NZ Open Source
Awards. Lead developer Hilary Oliver will give an overview of what cylc
does and how it works, and the particular advantages gained by our
decision to use the Python programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
