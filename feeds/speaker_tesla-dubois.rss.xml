The only existing methods for offline geocoding are expensive, cumbersome, or require working with code - all limiting factors for many researchers. So, a couple of classmates and I made a standalone desktop application using shell, Docker, PostGIS, and Python to geocode addresses through a simple GUI without ever sending them off the local machine. Come for the technical ins and outs and stay for the anecdotes about how my R background played into the daunting, frustrating, but ultimately successful task of creating a data science tool using unfamiliar technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
