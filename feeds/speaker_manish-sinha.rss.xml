&lt;p&gt;Abstract
GraphQL has become the defacto successor to REST. How does this impact Django developers? In this talk, we will explore the state of Django web API libraries focusing in on Django REST Framework and Graphene. We will start with a brief history overview where we will cover the origins of each library. Then we will move on to a comparative analysis of both along three axes: functionality, performance, and support. For functionality, we will look at how to perform CRUD operations under each. For performance, we will go over benchmarks of how each library handles a high throughput scenario and large data volume scenario. Lastly, we will look at how well supported each library both in terms of documentation, maintainer activity, and immediate online support.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, you’ll learn how to use Pydantic to transform that chaos into clean, typed, validated Python objects you can safely rely on in production.Based on our own real world experience with it, we'll explore how to define schemas, coerce LLM output into those schemas, and add guardrails through validation and structured prompting.&lt;/p&gt;
