&lt;p&gt;Signing up is on a first-come-first-served basis. The queue is reset every day in the morning.
You may talk about / present (almost) everything with certain boundaries:
- no promotion for products of companies, no call for 'we are hiring' (but you may name your employer).
- conference announcements are limited to one minute only
- one LT per person per conference policy: everyone who has not given an LT at this year's conference, yet, is ahead of you in the queue
- keep it short, the shorter the presentations, the more people can give a talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building interactive Machine Learning demos is now easier than ever. With Open Source libraries such as Gradio and Streamlit, you can use Python to craft demos, and use Spaces to share them with the rest of the ML ecosystem as well as non-ML people. Learning to create graphic interfaces for models is extremely useful for sharing with other people interesting in them. All of this leverages free, open-source tools that anyone can use.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, Omar will share how the community has tackled these challenges, including techniques to ensure torch model security and tooling for researchers to share their models. He'll also take attendees on a journey through the evolution of torch models distributed by the community, highlighting new trends and directions. Attending this talk will give attendees practical insights into the latest developments in model distribution and ecosystem trends.&lt;/p&gt;
