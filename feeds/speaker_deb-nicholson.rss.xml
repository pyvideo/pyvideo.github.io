&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From just a gleam in founder Chris Webber's eye to a full tilt media
hosting project supporting photos, HTML5 video, and more, the road to
federation has been a wild ride so far. We owe a lot to the huge
community of fellow federators whose work on the ostaus library enabled
us to start in the middle with our own not-quite-finished spin, Kuneco.
Kudos to the GNU project for getting excited about the web with us.
We're also thankful for the massive outpouring of project love that
channeled itself through transifex and has made Media Goblin
global-ready even though it isn't finished. Ever thought about switching
databases midstream? Come talk to us, Mongo to SQL wasn't as bad as we'd
been expecting. We'll also tell you all about our minimalist wsgi
un-framework design and how we think it's working compared to Django or
even Pylons/Pyramid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's still left do? Smoother interoperations with allied projects like
StatusNet and Diaspora. Support for more media types like 3D modelling
and presentations. World domination... in a friendly way! Swing by if
you're looking for a new project to get involved with or just want
details to take back to your own.&lt;/p&gt;
