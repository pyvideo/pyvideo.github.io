&lt;p&gt;Optimising for multiple objectives is a non-trivial task, especially when they are in conflict. For example how can one best overcome the classic trade-off between quality and cost of production, when the monetary value of quality is not defined? In this hands-on Python tutorial you will learn about Pareto Fronts and use them to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-Objective Optimisation, also known as Pareto Optimisation, is a method to optimise for multiple parameters simultaneously. When applicable, this method provides better results than the common practice of combining multiple parameters into a single parameter heuristic. The reason for this is quite simple. The single heuristic approach is like horse binders limiting the view of the solution space, whereas Pareto Optimisation enables a bird’s eye view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real world applications span from supply chain management, manufacturing, aircraft design to land use planning. For example when developing therapeutics, Pareto optimisation may help a biologist maximise protein properties like effectiveness and manufacturability while simultaneously minimising toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will provide a git repository with Jupyter notebooks with which you will apply lessons and tools learned to the simple Knapsack problem. Here you will program for filling a bag with packages with the objective of minimising the bag weight while maximising its content value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My objective is for you to gain a basic intuition for the technique, understand its advantages and shortcomings to be able to assess applicability for your own projects&lt;/p&gt;
