&lt;p&gt;By Eyal Kazin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlation does not imply causation. It turns out, however, that with some simple ingenious tricks one can unveil causal relationships within standard observational data, without having to resort to expensive random control trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I introduce the basic concepts of causal inference demonstrating in an accessible manner using visualisations. My main message for data analysts is that by adding causal inference to your statistical toolbox you are likely to conduct better experiments and ultimately get more from your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.g, by introducing Simpson’s Paradox, a situation where the outcome of all entries is in conflict with that of its cohorts, I shine a light on the importance of using graphs to model the data which enables identification and managing confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is targeted towards anyone making data driven decisions. The main takeaway is the importance of the story behind the data is as important as the data itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ultimate objective is to whet your appetite to explore more on the topic, as I believe that it will enable you to go beyond correlation calculations and extract more insights from your data, as well as avoid common misinterpretation pitfalls like Simpson’s Paradox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimising for multiple objectives is a non-trivial task, especially when they are in conflict. For example how can one best overcome the classic trade-off between quality and cost of production, when the monetary value of quality is not defined? In this hands-on Python tutorial you will learn about Pareto Fronts and use them to optimise for multiple objectives simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-Objective Optimisation, also known as Pareto Optimisation, is a method to optimise for multiple parameters simultaneously. When applicable, this method provides better results than the common practice of combining multiple parameters into a single parameter heuristic. The reason for this is quite simple. The single heuristic approach is like horse binders limiting the view of the solution space, whereas Pareto Optimisation enables a bird’s eye view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real world applications span from supply chain management, manufacturing, aircraft design to land use planning. For example when developing therapeutics, Pareto optimisation may help a biologist maximise protein properties like effectiveness and manufacturability while simultaneously minimising toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will provide a git repository with Jupyter notebooks with which you will apply lessons and tools learned to the simple Knapsack problem. Here you will program for filling a bag with packages with the objective of minimising the bag weight while maximising its content value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My objective is for you to gain a basic intuition for the technique, understand its advantages and shortcomings to be able to assess applicability for your own projects&lt;/p&gt;
