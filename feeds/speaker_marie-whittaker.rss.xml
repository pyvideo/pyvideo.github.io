&lt;p&gt;Distilling a world of data down to a few key indicators can be an effective way of keeping an audience informed, and this concept is at the heart of a good dashboard. This talk will cover a few methods of scraping and reshaping open data for dashboard visualization, to automate the boring stuff so you have more time and energy to focus on the analysis and content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover a basic scenario of curating open data into visualizations for an audience. The main goal is to automate data scraping/downloading and reshaping. I use python to automate data gathering, and Tableau and D3 as visualization tools -- but the process can be applied to numerous analytical/visualization suites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll discuss situations where a dashboard makes sense (and when one doesn't). I will make a case also that automation makes for a more seamless data gathering and updating process, but not always for smarter data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some python packages I'll cover for web scraping and downloading/reshaping open data include: openpyxl, pandas, xlsxwriter, and BeautifulSoup. I'll also touch on APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
