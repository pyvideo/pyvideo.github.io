&lt;p&gt;You're finally done building your super awesome world-changing python project and now you want to get it out there. Where do you start? DIY? Premium Services? In this talk I will cover 5 different ways to deploy Python and when you should use them. Whether you have a small hobby site that you want to deploy on the cheap, or have a big project you expect to scale, we will discuss all the things you need to consider when deploying Python. I will present a matrix of decision vectors (complexity, reliability, scale, cost, fun) and how each approach stacks up and examples and references of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approaches included in this talk will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-managed (self-hosted) VPS using native ubuntu –  This approach is best suited for hobby sized or small to medium projects where the primary deciding factor is either cost or learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-managed VPS hosting with Docker – This approach is also suitable for small projects but having to install and manage docker containers introduces additional complexity, though that complexity may be useful once you need to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serverless using AWS Lambda – This approach can be cost effective for small to medium projects, but the complexity may not be worth it for hobby sized projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serverless using Kubernetes – This is a very complex approach but is likely the best way to affordably scale to planet scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premium services like Vercel or Render –  This approach is great for some projects but not for all. I will cover the when and when not to consider using premium services.&lt;/p&gt;
