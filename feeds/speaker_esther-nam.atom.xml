Good software developers want to maintain high standards for quality, but may find it challenging to do so in the face of day-to-day pressures, deadlines, and distractions. Non-developers may feel it's acceptable to stop short of full engineering practice. In this talk we'll explore what engineering rigor looks like and discuss ways to uphold standards, even in the face of resistance. Attendees should come away with an understanding that engineering quality is more than just an ideal worth striving for, but a pragmatic way to keep our users happy, and to stay productive without burning out.&lt;/p&gt;

Some traits come more easily to mind than others when it comes to identifying a great developer. In this talk we will take a slightly different approach to evaluating software development best practices, and identify one underrated skill common to great software developers: empathy. I hope to demonstrate that cognitive and emotional empathy skills are critical to good software development. We will explore ways to cultivate this trait in order to become better developers, both for our own sakes and for the sake of the teams in which we work.&lt;/p&gt;
