It's supposed to be tricky,
difficult, erudite. That's crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architecture is about writing code that is effective: it's about finding
your target audience, identifying what they need, and thinking about how
to make it easy to do THAT. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about 5 basic principles for software architecture that can
be applied to projects big and small: correctness, clarity, simplicity,
modularity and empathy. It's about boiling architecture down to it's
bare essence - ergonomics. We'll look at these 5 principles and end up
with 4 super-distilled lessons that we can apply TODAY to our code to
make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
