What if I told you that you can access an enormous amount of information while sitting right there at your laptop? In this talk, I'll show you how to use Google Earth Engine to enrich your dataset. Either your exploring, or planning your next ML project, Geospatial data can provide you with a lot of information you did not know you had access to. Let me show you how!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by my post Four Years of Python where I talk through some
valuable lessons for intermediate/beginner programmers to have in mind
when scaling up their career in Python development. I mention topics
such as testing, keeping things simple, and educating yourself. The
other day I realized: I’ve been programming in Python for about 4 years
now. I do get paid to write code, but for some reason still don’t
consider myself a pro. I did learn some valuable lessons however. For
those who just got started with Python, you’ll hopefully take something
out of these lessons. For the experienced, see this as a celebration of
our beloved language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the topics I’ll cover are: - Reading is better then googling -
Keep things stupid simple - First make it work, then make it pretty -
Test early - Learn continuously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll share some learnings, principles, and resources that I’ve learned
through the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slides:&lt;/p&gt;
