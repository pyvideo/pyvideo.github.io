Stressful and tiring. What is it like to interview at 100 technology companies total in 4 months? I have done that. In August 2016, I quit a full-time software job to do job searching full-time.

Listen to my rants and ruminations from going through various interviewing processes from tiny seed-stage startups to large technology companies in Silicon Valley. Hiring is still broken.
