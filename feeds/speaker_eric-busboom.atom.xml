homeless people in Downtown San Diego from hand-marked paper maps to a
detailed geographic dataset, using a combination of machine vision
tools, Python programs and manual work. This talk will review how we
created the dataset and how we are working with government and
universities to use the dataset to inform social policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 7 years, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://downtownsandiego.org/"&gt;Downtown San Diego
Partnership&lt;/a&gt; has been conducting
monthly counts of homeless in the Downtown neighborhood. The data is
recorded on paper maps, which are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://downtownsandiego.org/wp-%20content/uploads/2019/02/January-2019-Unsheltered-Homeless-Sleep-Count-Web-%20Version-Final-003.pdf"&gt;compiled into a
spreadsheet.&lt;/a&gt;
This is a fantastic dataset which would be even more useful if the
hand-recorded paper maps were digitized. This project involves
collecting and digitizing 5 years of the monthly maps, to produce a
geographic dataset, whcih we will analyze for time trends and for the
association between homeess movements, geography and the built
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is suitable for people with an interest in using data to solve
social issues any level of skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe the scope of the homeless problem in San Diego and present
the opportunities for data science to inform homeless policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detail the process we used to convert the hand-marked maps, both the
manual process and use of machine vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the analysis of the final dataset, with specific emphasis on
geographic analysis using Geopandas and Jupyter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate the data management process, using Metatab to package
data and publish it to Wordpress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present how we are training volunteer analysts in the PyData tools to
answer data questions posed by researchers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn important aspects of an important social problem
and how to use data to solve these problems using a range of Python
tools.&lt;/p&gt;
