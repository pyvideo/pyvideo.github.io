&lt;p&gt;When I saw the phrase 'Again, Us, Python' at this PyCon 2023, as a SW educator,
I thought of the beginning of 2016~2020, when Python was loved and hated a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this session is not to 'provide the right answer/solution'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education. Especially, education in Korea is a sensitive and passionate topic, and it is almost impossible to find a 'good' method that will satisfy everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we can sympathize with the direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are prepared with an opportunity and understanding to understand each other's perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we will be able to find a better decision that more people can sympathize with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will share the 'background knowledge' necessary to sympathize with the topic of 'Python public education' with those in the 'non-education industry'.
- Python is good for education, but if it's good, it's good, so why is there such a fuss? - Why are you worried that Python, which is doing so well, will be hated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we think about the related background and topic and have more people sympathize,
I expect that we will be more likely to find 'more sympathetic, good methods for Python, students, and parents' than if we don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer
Hello, I'm Spencer. I'm not a developer, but an educator who loves Python. I'm currently an education manager at a boot camp called Programmers DevCourse, and I try to help junior developers in the same space as them. It's been 6 years since I started developing SW education, and these days, I often think about 'Isn't there a realistic way to prevent necessary education from being only for the rich?'&lt;/p&gt;
