&lt;p&gt;I will share my experience of growing as a developer through open source contributions. I prepared the presentation based on what I learned while contributing to ‘Django’, a representative web framework in Python among many open sources.
As a developer, I was able to experience growing not only technically but also mentally while contributing to open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also share tips on how to start contributing to open source and tips on how to contribute to open source with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not contributed much to open source yet, but I thought it would be good to contribute to open source and grow together with more Korean Python developers, so I decided to give the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bae Doo-sik (Jordan)
I am developing a credit rating analysis platform and data platform at Verticah, which creates the future sales transaction platform, Revenue Market. After graduating from college, I started my career in circuit design at LG and then switched to becoming a software engineer. After switching, I worked as a server engineer, data infrastructure engineer, and data engineer at various large and small startups such as Ateamventures, Sendbird, Chai, and Quotabook. I have been working in various positions and have been solving business and technical problems without any boundaries in the field. I try to make time to contribute to open source often and recently I have been interested in building a good data platform.&lt;/p&gt;
