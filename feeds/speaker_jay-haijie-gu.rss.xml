In this talk, we discuss SFrame and SGraph, two scalable data structures designed with machine learning tasks in mind. These external memory structures make efficient use of disk and utilize a whole bag of tricks for speed. On a single machine, SFrame supports real time interactive query on terabytes of data. When used in a distributed setting, SGraph supports iterative graph analytics tasks at unparalleled speed. On a graph with 100 billions of edges, SGraph computes Pagerank at 30secs/iter with only16 EC2 machines. We walk through the architectural design and discuss tricks for scale and speed. SFrame and SGraph are the backbone of a new Python machine learning platform called GraphLab Create. Both are available for download as open source projects, or as part of the GraphLab Create binary.&lt;/p&gt;
