Magql is extensible, looks familiar to developers who are used to Flask, and provides convenience on top of the &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; Python GraphQL library. I'll discuss why I decided to write this library, and how I went about it, including some of the technical challenges presented by GraphQL's complexity. GraphQL's nested schema and query language allows for some unique and weird possiblities compared to traiditional HTTP/REST APIs, and I'll show off some clever examples that demonstrate its potential. But that complexity can also lead to difficulties. Ultimately, the decision between GraphQL and REST is not clear cut, and this talk will also discuss some of our findings after using Magql and GraphQL in production, and where we want to go next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description
Browsers provide many ways to help keep your users and their data secure. In this talk, learn about what security features are available and how to enable them in Flask, Django, or other web applications. This talk is targeted at intermediate web developers, but should be useful for beginners as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Each section will discuss a type of vulnerability and how the browser can be configured to protect users. Examples will be shown using Flask, but are applicable to other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overview of how browsers behave by default and what configuration is available.
Cross-site Scripting and the X-XSS-Protection header
Content sniffing and the X-Content-Type-Options header
Clickjacking, using frames to trick users into clicking hidden content, and the X-Frame-Options header
Cookie header options and content security
History information and the Referrer-Policy header
HTTPS headers: TLS certificates, HTTP redirection, and Strict Transport Security
Content-Security-Policy controls where different types of content can be loaded from. Explain how to determine a good policy for an application.
Validating security configuration

Using these tools and interpreting results. What do good and bad configurations look like?&lt;/p&gt;
