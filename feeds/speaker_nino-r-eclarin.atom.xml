&lt;p&gt;Data science and software engineering is getting more and more intertwined with each other. But what is the common grounds between the two? How do we define the boundaries of the two disciplines? This talk will discuss the role of python in terms of development process for software engineers working in a data science environment. We will also tackle the different aspects of software engineering in relation to working with a data science oriented team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, I'm Ninz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a software engineer in the Philippines. I've worked with several startups in the past and currently working at Hacarus(focus on backend and machine learning integration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently taking my Masters degree in Computer Science here in the Philippines. My interests are Astronomy, Physics and Cooking :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🪄 說明 Description 🪄
Since 2014, my old high school constantly asked my help for all sorts of tech related consultation and advice. One of the most common request is to help students doing their research investigatory project integrate coding and programming as our school doesn't have any robotics or programming related class offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started my masters degree, I know for sure that I won't have that much time to help them so I told them, &amp;quot;Hey, can you just create a python class for students&amp;quot;? And to my surprise, they did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll discuss the challenges of implementing and adding a new course to an existing curriculum. Not to mention the difficulty of having limited resources like computers, budget, etc. It's a nightmare! But we made it happen regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🚀 講者介紹 About Speaker - Niño R. Eclarin 🚀
Hi, I'm Ninz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just finished my masters degree and currently started as an MLOps Engineer in Sydney. Doing some volunteer work for the dev community. Also doing some research with local schools, helping students apply machine learning and programming to their studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can talk to me about cycling, music, ML, and the universe in general. :D&lt;/p&gt;
