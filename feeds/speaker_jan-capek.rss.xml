passion for MicroPython – a Python 3.5 implementation for
embedded/bare metal systems. MicroPython is a wonderful project,
however, it deserves some love to isolate its core and use it within
a realtime environment. The talk shows a potential approach how to
run MicroPython as a task within FreeRTOS. The actual use case is a
2-cycle combustion engine management software for an RC model boat.
The system takes care of sampling exhaust gas temperature, engine rpm
and other useful telemetry data. MicroPython provides a very
comfortable environment for implementing the
inconvenient-to-write-in-C-business logic like storing telemetry data
on an SD card, processing remote commands from the pilot and changing
parameters of the engine management system accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk also shows how MicroPython can be plugged into a Kconfig
based configuration management tool that is known from Linux kernel.
The software ecosystem builds micropython as one of its components
among HAL drivers, sensor software libraries, and last but not least
the RTOS&lt;/p&gt;
