&lt;p&gt;Every day, millions of people use social media like Twitter or Facebook, to catch up on news and engage in discussions with other users. Our research group at Aalto University analyzes such discussions and studies how people interact on social media. Towards this end, visualization can be a very useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we use networkx, a python library, to process and visualize user interactions on Twitter. We introduce networkx with simple examples and continue with the visualization of twitter data. During the talk, weâ€™ll see that discussions about polarized topics (e.g., elections) look quite different than non-polarised ones.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
