In my presentation, I will describe what are requirements for the development process and the project infrastructure to take advantage of micro (services) quickly, efficiently and quite painlessly. We'll talk about what problems a pythonist will face when using microservices in production. Let's find out best practices to choose the framework or utilitarian library for a particular type of microservice. I'll tell you how to provide fault tolerance and handle errors from third-party integrations correctly. Let's go through the list of classic developers mistakes and a little bit of the topic of data caching.&lt;/p&gt;
