&lt;p&gt;In this talk you'll learn how to take advantage of features like
decorators and functions as first-class objects to set up a simple
plugin system that allows your app to be more flexible. In fact, you can
allow your users to add or customize functionality they want after you
ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using plugins, your code becomes more modular and maintainable. At
the same time your users may be able to use your great app to work with
data or challenges you didn't even know existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One powerful application of this is the decorator syntax, which makes it easy to apply one function to another at compile time. Decorators offer a simple and readable way of adding capabilities to your code. This tutorial will teach you how decorators work, and how to create your own decorators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being comfortable with using and creating decorators, will make you a more efficient Python programmer.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, you can use decorators to register functions as web

&lt;p&gt;Using decorators makes your code simpler and more readable. However, to
unlock the full capability of decorators, you should also be comfortable
writing your own. In this tutorial, you'll learn how decorators work
under the hood, and you'll get plenty of practice writing your own
decorators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be introduced to necessary background information about how
functions are first-class objects in Python and how you can define inner
functions. You'll learn how to unwrap the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;#64;decorator&lt;/tt&gt; syntactic sugar
and how to write solid decorators that you can use in your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being comfortable with using and creating decorators will make you a
more efficient Python programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
