charge of all those administration stuff. Simple solutions could end up
with management death spiral, while complex systems like Redmine would
be an overkill. Roboconf is the home-made solution we've brought up: a
conference operation site built upon Django, with issue tracking,
document organizing, notifications, and staff management all in one
place. In this session, I'll describe situations we faced when
organizing SITCON 2013, how Roboconf got itself implemented, what
difference it has made throughout the process, and crazy stuff other
folks at SITCON built around this system.&lt;/p&gt;
