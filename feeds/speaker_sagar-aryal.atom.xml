It gets harder when the original authors aren't around to explain what they were thinking. These pain points related to legacy software are often the motivation for many organizations to adopt robust open source solutions. Open source software is becoming more and more the standard in any tech stack. Knowing how to navigate the world of open source software and how to best implement it is a skill that is becoming ever more important for any software engineer. Python is one of the most popular languages when it comes to open source. In this talk, we hope to outline why this is and how you can take advantage of it in your software migrations.&lt;/p&gt;
