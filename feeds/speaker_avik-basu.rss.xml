Building a Docker image for Python applications is generally uncomplicated, yet optimizing these images requires extra work. Notably, many of these optimizations are uniquely tailored to Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk focuses on techniques and best practices to build more efficient Docker images for Python in order to generate reproducible and quicker builds while reducing the image sizes at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

In most cases, it is better to just have multiple repositories that each contain a library, an application or a data science project with Jupyter notebooks. However, in some cases it makes sense to have a monorepo containing multiple projects often sharing a common theme or an ecosystem. This talk will explore the circumstances where monorepos make more sense, how to create monorepos containing Python libraries and projects, handle dependencies, version management and CI/CD setup. We shall go through a sample Python mono repository, thus making it practical for attendees to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

Model predicts or
provides a certain output but it is very difficult to generate any
actionable insights directly. This is mostly because we generally have
no idea which features are contributing the most to the model behavior
internally. SHAP provides a certain way to explain model predictions,
and can act as an important tool in a data scientistâ€™s toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will begin by explaining to the audience the need for
explainable ML models and why it is important to understand beyond what
the model outputs. We will then briefly go over the mathematical
intuition behind Shapley values and its origins from game theory. After
that we will walk through a couple of case studies of tree based and
neural network based models. We will be focusing on interpretation of
SHAP through various plots using the shap library in Python. Finally, we
will discuss the best practices for interpreting SHAP visualizations,
handling large datasets, and common pitfalls to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, containerization using tools like Docker has become a cornerstone for deploying applications efficiently. This talk focuses on techniques and best practices to build more efficient Docker images for Python in order to generate reproducible and quicker builds while reducing the image sizes at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
