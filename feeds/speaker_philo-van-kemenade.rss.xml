From when we were hunter-gatherers until today we've always had reasons for accumulating things. Now that we also collect digitally, interesting things can happen. With the help of technology we can easily gather, process, connect, catalogue and zoom in and out of millions of items. Are there also dangers of seeing the things you collect as mere data points? This talk will discuss the practice of digital collecting from a technologist perspective and will touch on collecting as an art practice, digital art collections, webscraping, digital libraries and personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
