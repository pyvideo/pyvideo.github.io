&lt;p&gt;In the world of Data Science, Python and R are very popular. Apache Spark is a highly scalable data platform. How could a Data Scientist integrate Spark into their existing Data Science toolset? How does Python work with Spark? How could one leverage the rich 10000+ packages on CRAN for R?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start with PySpark, beginning with a quick walkthrough of data preparation practices and an introduction to Spark MLLib Pipeline Model. We will also discuss how to integrate native Python packages with Spark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare to PySpark, SparkR is a new language binding for Apache Spark and it is designed to be familiar to native R users. In this talk we will walkthrough many examples how several new features in Apache Spark 2.x will enable scalable machine learning on Big Data. In addition to talking about the R interface to the ML Pipeline model, we will explore how SparkR support running user code on large scale data in a distributed manner, and give examples on how that could be used to work with your favorite R packages.&lt;/p&gt;
