support for out­of­core data analysis without changing code, without
breaking APIs and without losing the performance advantage provided by
FORTRAN libraries or just­in­time compilers. wendelin­core acts
transparently as distributed shared virtual memory manager for binary
data handled by python interpreters deployed on a cluster. Thanks to
wendelin­ core, each python interpreter can access elementary ndarray
structures of virtually 2 exabytes in a single memory block, whatever
the amount of RAM available on each node. With wendelin­core, a cluster
of inexpensive PCs can thus act as a teramory server at much lower cost.
A cluster of tera­-memory servers can act as an examemory machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
In addition to bringing true BIg Data support to NumPy libraries, wendelin­core also provides native persistency of ndarrays thanks to its integration with NEO database. NEO together with wendelin­core can shard and store ndarrays on a redundant array of inexpensive computers and provide native support for python exception handling, thus enforcing a rollback of any change made to data in case of bug or error during a calculation.

The talk will focus on the technical aspects of wendelin­-core. It will explain the technical approach that has been used for the first implementation: what has been achieved, what is still weak, what can be improved. It will explain how to hook wendelin­-core to a persistency layer. It will then present the technical roadmap and suggest how to integrate wendelin­core to other persistency layers or to other data structures.

Numba is a

increases, many tools to optimize performance have emerged. Indeed, this
duo has relatively poor performance when compared to scientific codes
written in legacy languages like C or Fortran. Cython, Numba, numexpr
and parakeet belongs to this new compiler ecosystem. And so does
Pythran, a Python to C++11 translator for scientific Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Pythran uses a static compilation approach a la Cython, but with full backward compatibility with Python. It does not only turns Python code into C++ code, it also performs Python/Numpy specific optimizations, generates calls to a parallel, vectorized runtime and makes it possible to write OpenMP annotation in the original Python code. It supports a large range of Numpy functions and can combine them in efficient ways: it can optimize high­level modern Python/Numpy codes and not only Fortran­ with­ a­ Python­ flavor ones.

This talk presents the existing compilation approach and optimization opportunities for numerical Python, their strengths and weaknesses, then focus on the specificities of the Pythran compiler.

Data analysis. We tackle complex problems such as Dynamic Pricing

The fact that a lot of or analyses use geolocation data adds a specific

as it is beneficial for everyone in our Marketplace: Passenger can get
lower prices and better service, Drivers spend more time with someone in
their car and have higher earnings…&lt;/p&gt;

With
multiple intersecting lines, the daily functioning of the London Tube
network poses many interesting questions: What effects do severe delays
on the Piccadilly Line have on passengers taking the Northern Line? What
is the shortest path from station x to station y? How does overcrowding
on one station affect its neighbouring stations? These are but a few
examples of the many questions one can start to investigate using two
Python libraries: graph­tool for manipulating and analysing graphs and
bokeh for visualizing and streaming “live” data from simulations. In
this talk, I will briefly show how one can transform structures such as
the London Underground map into programmatic objects that can be
analysed and manipulated using Python. Furthermore, I will show examples
of simulations based on the publicly available data from Transport for
London and illustrate how simulations can be used to glean insight on
the large scale behaviour of a complex system. Last but not least, I
hope to illustrate how the bokeh server can be leveraged to create
“real­time” visualizations of simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
