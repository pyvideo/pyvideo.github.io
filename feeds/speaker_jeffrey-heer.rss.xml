How might the design of improved tools accelerate people's exploration and understanding of data? Covering both interactive demos and principles from academic research, my talk will examine how to craft a careful balance of interactive and automated methods, combining concepts from data visualization, machine learning, and computer systems to design novel interactive analysis tools.&lt;/p&gt;
