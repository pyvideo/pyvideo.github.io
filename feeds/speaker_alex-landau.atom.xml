While it encompasses traditional devops areas such as monitoring,
metrics, and infrastructure management, it’s much deeper and empowers
developers at all levels of the stack. &lt;strong&gt;Observability is about
achieving a deep understanding of your software&lt;/strong&gt;. This not only helps
you localize and debug production issues but removes uncertainty and
speculation, &lt;strong&gt;empowering developers&lt;/strong&gt; to know their tools and improving
engineering excellence. Observability helps developers “understand the
narrative” of what’s going on in their software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is about how we’ve driven adoption of a culture of
observability within our engineering culture. We'll define and motivate
for our focus on observability; discuss the tangible tools we’ve built
and best practices we’ve adopted to ingrain observability into our
engineering culture; and provide some specific, real-world results we’ve
achieved as part of this effort. We'll will focus particularly on the
tooling we’ve adopted around Django and Celery and some interesting
experiences we had extending their internals.&lt;/p&gt;
