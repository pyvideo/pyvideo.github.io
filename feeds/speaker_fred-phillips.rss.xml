This talk will introduce the audience to the import system, how it works, and how it can be adapted for their needs. We will build a simple import hook that can inspect what is being imported, and go on to demonstrate how we can use the import system to load Python modules from a database and how to reload files on disk immediately as they are changed.&lt;/p&gt;
