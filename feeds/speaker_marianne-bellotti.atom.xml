growth. For projects like CKAN success can be almost as frustrating as
obscurity. A python backed open data platform, CKAN is used all over the
world to catalogue and distribute public data. The United Nations uses
it, the Whitehouse uses it, governments large and small hire developers
to customize and fine tune their installations. Why then does so little
of that work make it back into CKAN core? This talk explores the
problems that mid-size open source projects face getting in-house
professional developers to contribute back, and what project maintainers
can do to encourage those using their code to share their improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
