Moore in 1970. Forth is famous for being stack based and using reverse polish notation: the operators come after their operands. A Forth program to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius (C = (F-32) Ã— 5/9) is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;32 - 5 * 9 /&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 23rd August 2016 I had an urge to write a Forth system in 64-bit Intel Assembly. This talk is about what happens next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it I unpack what it means to implement a language. I dig a little into a lower-level description of typical computer hardware, and a little into 64-bit Intel Assembly. Compared to Python, Forth is a low-level language; compared to Assembly, Forth is a high-level language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll talk about how we can implement one language in terms of another, by building models, and how we can model languages and model computational processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forth is a tiny, but powerful, language. Moore's insight was to discover a language that was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sufficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to implement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extensible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that Forth implementations are typically composed of a tiny nucleus (typically in Assembly) surrounded by a larger amount of &amp;quot;Forth-in-Forth&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come. Let's implement a language.&lt;/p&gt;
