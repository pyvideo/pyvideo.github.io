&lt;p&gt;The presentation will describe the basic principles of machine learning: features, cross-validation and powerful, but simple algorithm - Random Forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants will learn basic pipeline for solving a simple pattern recognition problem, tools and libraries which are nowadays used by data scientists worldwide and they will also learn how to deploy their trained prediction module as a Flask web-service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author:  Aleksei Tiulpin is working as a research scientist at the University of Oulu. His research is focused mostly on with Image Analysis and Machine Learning. In addition to that he has experience in software development for research purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
