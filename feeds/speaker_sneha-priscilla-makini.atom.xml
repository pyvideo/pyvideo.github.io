multiple forms on the same page? Do you end up writing large quantities
of code to deal with a dynamically changing set of forms? If so, Django
Formsets is the perfect life saver for you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most new Django users are intimidated at the idea of Formsets and more
often than not, this flexible feature goes unnoticed! This talk will
cover the following topics: - Where exactly does one use Formsets and
how? - Dealing with dynamically changing forms. - Views &amp;amp; Formsets. -
What are the most common roadblocks and what to do about them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also cover how Formsets helped me code GNU Mailman's user
settings management feature to handle mailing list settings for a
multiple-users multiple-lists scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
