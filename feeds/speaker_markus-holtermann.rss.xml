And despite all the testing we do, some operations and interactions with these services will not work out the way we expect or hope. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great to be able to reconstruct what led to a problem? And then analyze if the same problem occurred at other times?
In this talk, I want to look at structured logging. What are the benefits of it over plain-text logging? How can it be used effectively?
Logging, by itself, can help to trace bugs. Structured logging adds additional, post-logging capabilities when used correctly. Because log events are structured data, they can be analyzed much more efficiently and effectively than plain text log messages. Furthermore, one can even build graphs and diagrams to visualize what‚Äôs happening in a service nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

And it has been for ages. It only became even
more powerful over the last years. Django‚Äôs ORM can be intimidating
because it can do so many things. And it can also be confusing when
trying to find out how to do things.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you want to find that the needle in the haystack of your data? There are plenty options how you can achieve that. With various levels of complexity, confidence, and reliability. I'll give an insight into what the most common are nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're tasked with building a search for the project you're working on. But where do you start? What search implementation are you going to use? There's a sheer unlimited set of ways to implement &amp;quot;I'm looking for X in Y&amp;quot; out there. Elasticsearch, LIKE and ILIKE queries, MySQL's Fulltext Search, PostgreSQL's Fulltext Search, Solr, Whoosh, Xapian, to only name a few. I'll be looking at the most common ones and will be showing some basic implementation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be familiar with Django in so much as that I'm not talking about how to create or update an object in a database. You should also have an idea of what database transactions are. The talk will feature some code snippets that I will provide in full, afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever thought about what happens when somebody finds a security issue in Django? How does one responsibly disclose the issue? What happens after that? How does the Django team work on it? What happens until a Django security release is published? What comes afterwards?
Also, Django is ‚Äúreassuringly secure‚Äù. Let‚Äôs look at the history ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll give an insight on how the Django team handles security issues,
which can serve as a guideline and followed in own projects. We'll
will also review the history of Django's security issues to identify
hotspots and areas to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;

communication medium humanity ever had. The Internet. Being able to at
least partially understand how this &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; works, we know that it takes
a lot of work to keep it running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that IT administrators use configuration and system management
tools to deploy changes to thousands of servers and keep them in sync.
But how can one roll back a change done in the past that turned out to
introduce a bug?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk I will introduce you to configuration management and explain
the problems that arise over time and make changing something back
complicated or even impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
