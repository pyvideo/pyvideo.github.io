I will also share my personal experience of implementing such a system, code-named Cloud AI Operating System (CAIOS): what went well, what still needs to be resolved, and where, in my view, the Python community could contribute in making Python as the number one choice for cloud programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure as Code - the use of repeatable scripts or SDKs to configure the cloud environment for an application - has expanded the possibilities of Serverless with Continuous Delivery. However, there are fundamental issues with IaC: it is a time-consuming and tedious process to prepare the scripts, the activity requires the involvement of DevSecOps experts, and the scripts are only loosely related to the application code. For any non-trivial application, these scripts grow very quickly in complexity and size. Applying IaC to optimize the configuration of the test, staging, and production environments only exacerbates these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure from Code is a recent advancement over IaC that addresses these obstacles. IfC interprets a mainstream programming language code and automatically generates the specifications needed to configure a cloud environment. So far, the most advanced solutions, such as ServerlessCloud, Ampt, or Nitric, were proposed for the TypeScript ecosystem. While, for Python, AWS Chalice is a cloud-vendor-specific solution and offers a relatively limited feature set.&lt;/p&gt;

For computation services (aka Function as a Service) Python is usually supported out of the box and at least in some environments (AWS) yields superior performance. However the same is for JavaScript with a strong argument in favor of full-stack development. In this talk I will demonstrate how by applying Domain-Driven Design patterns front-end services where JavaScript might be more suitable could be delineated from core domain services where Python has a number of clear advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
