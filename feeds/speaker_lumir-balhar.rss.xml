As a volunteer firefighter, Lumir can
tell you all about that feeling. But there are also other ways to
help others, and some don't involve life-or-death situations. What
about changing a person's life by teaching them how to program?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching doesn't just give you a great feeling. It can also help you
make new friends, improve your presentation skills, and even make you
a better programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us for two stories of how we started teaching Python, what it
means for us, what it can mean for you â€“ and how we're making it
easier for you to join us.&lt;/p&gt;
