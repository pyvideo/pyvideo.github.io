&lt;p&gt;When I first told my friends and family that I was taking some time off to learn about blender and python for scientific visualization, some of them became confused and worried, thinking I had snakes in my kitchen. In fact, I'm a scientist/engineer and I need an environment to calculate things and show the results, and these two open source packages offered everything I need!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python has become a popular platform in physics for both professional research and teaching settings. Scipy and numpy have most of the goodies we need, and there are plenty of other libraries out there. However, depending on one's previous experience with other tools, learning to really use python &amp;quot;pythonically&amp;quot; can sometimes be a little bumpy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll first give a quick tutorial on how to get started doing physics in python the right way - the tutorial that I &lt;em&gt;wish&lt;/em&gt; I could have read in the beginning. I'll give some examples of interactive programs using the matplotlib widgets as a user interface, for a variety of engineering and physics applications. This is the International Year of Light [1] celebrating a number of optical &amp;quot;birthdays&amp;quot;, so we'll look at some of those with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I'll show some results where I cast a complicated math/optics problem as a collection of python objects (in python, everything is an object!) to make the solution more tangible. Since blender - a rendering and animation environment with python scripting built-in - eats python objects for breakfast, one can just transfer the code into blender and make animated 3D visualization of the problem setup, calculation, and final results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David enjoys physics, math, optics, engineering... and now, python! He's worked in the semiconductor industry, both in process development and metrology. Currently he's looking at &amp;quot;what's next&amp;quot; in optical communications.  Note: check the personal link close to PyCon for additional information about talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW LINK (July 2015)!! Works better. I'll be adding posts regularly now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 摘要 Abstract 💡
Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful numerical technique to predict the behavior of atoms and complex materials without a full quantum mechanical treatment. It makes it much faster to do simulation/optimization for a wide range of sciences and technologies, from designing new drugs and genetic treatments of disease to nano- &amp;amp; next-gen semiconductor materials to industrial chemical &amp;amp; semiconductor processing to fundamental surface sciences. In this talk I’ll first explain the basics in an easy-to-understand way and run some pure python “DIY” implementations so we can see “under the hood” what’s going on. Then I’ll introduce LAMMPS via Python and associated packages, build some molecular structures, evolve them dynamically and see the results in 3D. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.lammps.org/pictures.html#lammpspaper"&gt;https://www.lammps.org/pictures.html#lammpspaper&lt;/a&gt; You’ll understand the basics and be able to install LAMMPS and start simple MD calculations right away, then refer to the tutorials and examples provided at the end of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1, 13:40-13:55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) is a powerful tool for 2D structures on surfaces and is critical for studying new materials for superconductivity and quantum computing. Real time diffraction patterns on a hemispherical phosphor screen are recorded with high dynamic range and synchronized with other experimental variables. Spot pattern detection and automatic analysis provides experimental insight and system monitoring. I'll briefly introduce LEED and show how spot patterns are analyzed off-line then describe the new Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera and how to capture high dynamic range images. The Raspberry Pi 4 is a powerful computer which can coordinate the real-time imaging with other experimental parameters by directly controlling equipment via RS-232 and USB &amp;amp; monitoring others via GPIB. Last I'll show how automatic spot detection via NumPy/SciPy and OpenCV on Raspberry Pi are used to analyze data in real time and provide the experimenter new insight into the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 15 minute talk there will not be an overly large amount of details possible. Standard libraries like NumPy, SciPy, PIL and OpenCV are so popular that I will not spend any time explaining them. and instead point the audience to the most suitable tutorials and resources. Instead, I'll focus on A) several code snippets showing how to easily capture images and other types of data, B) how to ananlyze the images in my case (many small bright spots that need to be classified and their positions determined), and C) coordinate all of these steps a simple, easy script. I think it's most important that they have a clear path to how they can build a simple experimental system themselves and have some positive results quickly. WIth that, they can proceed at their own pace, or rope in a more experienced programmer. I want to help them understand how easy this is so that they are not scared to get their feet wet.&lt;/p&gt;
