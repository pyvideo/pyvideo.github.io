We
look at how a network perspective can reveal valuable information about
corruption in public procurement, internal collaboration at a
multinational firm, and the tone of campaigns on Twitter, all with the
phenomenal NetworkX library. NetworkX is a highly productive and
actively maintained library that interacts well with other libraries and
environments. It inherits many Python strengths like fast prototyping
and ease of teaching. We also discuss alternatives like graph-tool and
igraph.&lt;/p&gt;
