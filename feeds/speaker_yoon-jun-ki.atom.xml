&lt;p&gt;This is a session to share episodes, experiences, and lessons learned while contributing to large open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will talk about the overall process for contributing to open source, from why we started open source, finding bug tickets, understanding the overall flow through debugging, writing bug patches and test code, to maintainer reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be especially helpful for those who are interested in open source or have ever thought about contributing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you :)&lt;/p&gt;

Hello, I am Yoon Jun-ki, a 3rd-year backend engineer. Since I use the Django web framework a lot, I have naturally become interested in open source activities. I am interested in and like to talk about various areas related to development, such as good code, culture, communication, and business, as well as simply developing code. I am very happy and excited to be giving a conference presentation, which I have dreamed of since the beginning of my career.&lt;/p&gt;
