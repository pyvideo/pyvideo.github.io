Funded by Amazon AWS, Google, Microsoft, and Citi, Alpha-Omega has partnered with the Python Software Foundation to support two critical security-focused roles for the Python Ecosystem. Last year's talk with Seth Larson and Michael Winser was the origin story of this effort and showed the road ahead. This year's talk will be at least 50% more interesting and entertaining because we're adding Mike Fiedler. Together we have a lot to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Winser is the co-founder of Alpha-Omega. Seth Larson is the Python Security Developer in Residence and Mike Fiedler is the PyPI Safety and Security Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
