[EuroPython 2015]
[22 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plone is a Document Management System and Content Management System
that has been in the Python scope for more than 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plone 5â€™s features allow us to manage content, define various kinds of
content and provide a nice useful UI to work on semantic web
technologies. In this talk we are going to explain our approach for
using Plone with the Python machine learning toolkit sklearn (http
://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to enable clusterization and
classification of content using a scalable content management system.
We will also add some sophisticated front-end gloss using the new
functionalities on frontend development added on Plone 5 and some real
use cases of CMS/DMS with machine learning using sklean and solr.&lt;/p&gt;

Based on JSON schema types allows to define a Traversal API with strong security and granularity. With an abstracted storage layer its possible to provide support for Couch, Cassandra and Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common problems on my daily basis data management is a way to store and secure objects with information in a transactional scalable infrastructure. Having an async API that holds security, triggers and transactional operations allows to provide an interface for managing the data that will be processed by the machine learning engines on batch operations. Including async queues of operations allows to provide model inference on the objects on real time operations on objects on the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 15 years on Plone/Zope framework we started to design a new concept using all the lessons learned on content management to provide a CRUD storage layer for big data objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MVP: How we were able to deliver value based on Guillotina framework for a fast prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data normalization: How we normalize unstructured data, including videos and audios, and extract value from it using NLP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NucliaDB: a new open-source, cloud native &amp;amp; multimodal indexing database with high reading performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclia OSS: Our open source plan and how we want to help OSS projects like Fast API, Django, Guillotina, Plone, Flask, Pyramind... to deliver more value. The talk will cover how Nuclia is changing the search industry status quo: It will show how using Nuclia's end-to-end API, is able to index and process any kind of data, including audios and videos, to boost applications with an AI &amp;amp; multi-language semantic search engine. We will specially focus on NucliaDB, the NLP database designed to store non structured information to provide fine grained searchability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
