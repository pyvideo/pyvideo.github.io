All of this will be shown on CPUs using PyTorch. To start with, I will walk through dinosaur bone identification and the importance of sediment deposits in locating dinosaur bones. Then I will show you how to decompose an image classification problem, like dinosaur fossil hunting, into a few key components: building context from data, proper data representation to this model, model definition/training, and producing actionable insights from model predictions. The author has used this model to find new dinosaur bones in the Morrison Formation!&lt;/p&gt;
