We are using image recognition technology to enable species identification and to help with the curation of this massive catalogue. In this talk I will describe how we are building an image recognition system with the aim of identifying all known species in the natural world. The system has gone through a number of iterations at this point using a variety of computer vision and machine learning techniques, from nearest neighbour search to classification with fine tuned deep convolutional networks. All of this has been implemented in Python using scikit-learn, Numpy, Caffe and Tensorflow. Aside from the obvious machine learning challenges in designing and training such a system we faced numerous technical challenges while implementing and scaling this system in a cost effective manner. I will discuss these challenges, our solutions and the remaining open problems. While this talk will be relatively high level with few code examples and no math (but lots moths), it will be of most interest to those who have some knowledge of machine learning concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

deep learning applications, basic Python programming skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brief Description Deep Learning is revolutionizing both Data Science and
Artificial Intelligence real-world applications. Yet, being the
discipline so young, it’s not straightforward to understand both the
reasoning at its core and its countless use cases. In this talk we will
review the basics of Neural Networks, from the classical CNNs to the
current state of the art, comparing them through real industry
applications and highlighting pros and cons in a business setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract / Summary Deep Learning has been on a hype roll for a few
years. Being such a young discipline makes deep learning interesting,
but also subject to misunderstandings. Every year, brand new
architectures rise, taking over old ones and outperforming state of the
art benchmarks for accuracy. Further, the applications of deep learning
are at the core of some of the most advanced technologies like
autonomous driving, personal assistants, and customer profiling. In such
a context it is not straightforward to grasp what is at the core of deep
learning itself, and what is common to all the architectures, neither to
realize how concrete use cases can be tackled. Using Python, we’ll take
the audience from the simplest neuron, the atom of the deep learning
world, to the most recent architectures. We’ll achieve this using a
simple Convolutional Neural Network as a building block and comparing
that to the latest breakthroughs in image recognition. In doing this
we’ll try to give an answer to the following questions: • Is deep
learning actually useful in a business setting? • What about state of
the art techniques in the Computer Vision field: are we just stacking
more and more convolutional and pooling layers? We will then address
real industry applications (e.g. the insurance sector) using analyzed
techniques. This will include opening some of these so- called black box
models and retraining them, at least partially, on our datasets, or
building a complete brand new network from scratch, tailoring it
according to the application needs and datasets characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
