&lt;p&gt;In a scenario where one is writing a function that will be used by another programmer who may not be able to see that function (i.e is using a module, or other abstracted calling method) whose responsibility is it to ensure the correct type of the arguments, the caller or the callee?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk discusses ideas around which way is best and why in the hope to help you increase performance and reduce errors.&lt;/p&gt;
