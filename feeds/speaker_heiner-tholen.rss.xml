In this talk, our evaluation will be presented. The final implementation will be shown, alongside python-tools we've built and lessons learned during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding time-series data is essential to handle automatically generated data, be it from server logs, IoT devices or any other continuous measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to handle the large amounts of incoming data from concrete mixing trucks, we evaluated a number of time-series databases as well as services to stream-process the data. For all of those decisions a key question was, of course, how well any of these tools integrate with our existing, all-Python backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right angle on time-series data will help you move tons of data with little engineering effort. In this talk, you'll learn from our practical experiences of choosing and implementing a time-series database in a Python context. You'll go away with a better understanding of how you can efficiently store, analyse and exploit streaming data.&lt;/p&gt;
