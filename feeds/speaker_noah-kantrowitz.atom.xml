With Django offering a fully async API, new possibilities have opened to simplify the many different microservices into a single Python application that hosts the scrapers, query systems, and administrative interface all in one box. With this comes simplified code and deployment, and many other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover a case study in building this kind of all-in-one ETL system, the components used, and how they all fit together. This includes both API and web scrapers, GraphQL for querying and streaming, and a Discord interface for notifications and control.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Secrets come in many forms, passwords, keys, tokens. All crucial for the operation of an application, but each dangerous in its own way. In the past, many of us have pasted those secrets in to a text file and moved on, but in a world of config automation and ephemeral microservices these patterns are leaving our data at greater risk than ever before.
â€‹
New tools, products, and libraries are being released all the time to try to cope with this massive rise in threats, both new and old-but-ignored. This talk will cover the major types of secrets in a normal web application, how to model their security properties, what tools are best for each situation, and how to use them with major Python frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;
Noah Kantrowitz is a web developer turned infrastructure automation enthusiast, and all around engineering rabble-rouser. By day he builds tools and teaches, and by night he works with the Python Software Foundation infrastructure team. He is an active member of the Chef community, and enjoys merge commits, cat pictures, and beards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intellectual property is everywhere in software, especially in open source. From licenses to copyrights, our world is one drenched in IP. This talk will cover the essentials of IP law in the US, giving both open source developers and users a working knowledge of the systems behind those big blocks of legal text. Starting from the four main branches of IP, we'll cover topics like copyrights, licenses, trademarks, CLAs, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
