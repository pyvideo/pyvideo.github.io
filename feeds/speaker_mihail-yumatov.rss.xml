In my report I will try to explain why you should pay attention to SaltStack even if you are actually using Chef or Puppet, why – how it can be helpful. I will speak about the usage of how we use SaltStack for the projects deployment automation and take into consideration the additional good possibilities like notification system between services, system of users’ rights and some other things.&lt;/p&gt;
