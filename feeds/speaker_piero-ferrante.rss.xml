If so, phrases like 'don't recreate the wheel' also probably came to mind. This talk will address compelling arguments on both sides of the topic while telling the story of why we at Aetna ultimately decided to do just that and what we learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineering a sophisticated in-house risk management solution for a commercial lending platform doesn't necessarily need to involve millions of lines of low-level code, clunky desktop applications, fancy front-end development, or messy spreadsheets. That is, so long as the problem is approached objectively and the solutions are evaluated critically.&lt;/p&gt;
