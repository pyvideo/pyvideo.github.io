Humans and data science are flawed on their own. Humans lack the ability to process large volumes of information. Machines lack intuition, empathy, and nuance. You'll learn how to guide users of expert-use systems by applying data science to their user experience. This allows us to take advantage of the human-touch while leveraging our large datasets. What is the relationship between human decisions and algorithms? Are we thinking about data science all wrong? In this talk, you'll learn the ways we balance human decisions and data science throughout our applications, the challenges we have faced along the way and the future of the relationship between humans and data.&lt;/p&gt;
