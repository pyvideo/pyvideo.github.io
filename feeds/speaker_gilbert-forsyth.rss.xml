While Python has a wealth of data science libraries and tools, there are still plenty of utilities that live outside of the scientific Python ecosystem. Xonsh provides a way of gluing ALL of your tools together. Additionally, as a shell, xonsh comes with batteries-included features that are important in a scientific context. If you are new to shells, want to use Python for &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, or just plain fed up with sh-lang syntax, this tutorial is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
