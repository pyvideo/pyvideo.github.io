&lt;p&gt;Traditional Quarto documents often lack interactivity, limiting the ability of students and researchers to fully explore and engage with the presented topic. In this talk, we propose a novel approach that utilizes webR, a WebAssembly-powered version of R, to seamlessly embed R code directly within the browser without the need for a server. We demonstrate how this approach can transform static Quarto documents into dynamic examples by leveraging webR's capabilities through standard Quarto code cells, enabling real-time execution of R code and dynamic display of results. Our approach empowers educators and researchers alike to harness the power of interactivity and reproducibility for enhanced learning and research experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
