While searching for things &amp;quot;In Your Area&amp;quot; may be a solution, some topics (like where you want to go to college) can be a little more nuanced. In this talk shows how I use Elasticsearch's accuracy and Google Places API to show college options in a requested area. The example project is a college search app that gives you the ability to look for schools based on an area and indicators like acceptance rates and expected student load debt. I'll show how to perform Places autocorrect query and then use the returned information to curate search results within Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk provides an introduction to using pytest for testing Flask applications. Before diving into how to use pytest, this talk explains what should be tested in a Flask application. Next, detailed examples are covered on how to write unit and functional test functions with pytest that are specific to Flask applications. Documentation of the tests is also highlighted using the GIVEN-WHEN-THEN approach. After writing tests, running the tests using pytest (with different options) is presented to demonstrate how easy and powerful pytest is. Examples include verbose mode, running only the last failed tests, and running specific test cases. Next, the concept of fixtures in pytest is presented and detailed examples of how to initialize the state of a Flask application are covered. This section includes properly initializing a Flask application to avoid not having the application context created. Finally, the idea of code coverage is introduced and an example of running coverage.py on a Flask application is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

As a developer you come across a bug every now and then. To solve a bug debug comes very handy. In this talk, I would love to show you one of the ways to debug your flask application within a docker container using VSCode. To do that first, we will build a small flask application and write a Dockerfile for that and run the application. When we want to debug that application we need debugpy package which I don't want to put it in my final docker image so instead of building a different Dockerfile for each purpose we will get to know a bit about Docker multistage build concept and update the current Dockerfile and debug our flask application.&lt;/p&gt;

And depending on what you use, you may even have to change because the provider you are using is changing their APIs. Flask-Multipass provides an easy-to-use wrapper around this complexity. This talk will go into details on why the extension was created, which cases it covers (and which it doesn't - it's not another Flask-Login!), and how its flexibility allows easy implementation of new authentication methods.&lt;/p&gt;

That way, you can convert a web app into a desktop app with just two extra lines of code.
Flaskwebgui just uses threading underneath to start a flask server and the browser in app mode (for chrome). It has some advantages over flask-desktop because it doesn't use PyQt5, so you won't have any issues regarding licensing and over Eel because you don't need to learn any logic other than Flask. Github link: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ClimenteA/flaskwebgui"&gt;https://github.com/ClimenteA/flaskwebgui&lt;/a&gt; Motivation: At first console apps were enough to solve what I needed, but in time more complex problems appeared that needed a user interface which does a lot of stuff. For something small (some inputs, buttons..) Tkinter does the job even though it looks uglyish. Other alternatives for more complex stuff are PyQT, PySide, wxPython, Kivy, which are good options and you can make nice GUIs with them, but.. I still found it pretty hard to get started. I like Flask - it was very easy to learn and I wanted to use it everywhere. Learning new libraries takes time and time is something we can't buy (yet). I looked for a solution to make the user interface in html/css/javascript with a backend in Flask. I found pywebview which was close of what I needed, but for whatever reason some javascript code didn’t got executed as it should have(js worked in a normal browser, but not in pywebview window). I also had issues when I tried to freeze it with Pyinstaller — all of them probably having a solution somewhere, but I just wanted to ship it and leave it. That's how flaskwebgui was &lt;cite&gt;born&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
