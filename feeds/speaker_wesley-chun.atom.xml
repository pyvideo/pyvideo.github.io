App Engine apps execute on servers in Google data centers and use the same technology that powers Google's websites for speed, scalability, and reliability. Applications are easy to maintain and scale as your traffic and resource needs grow (or shrink). With App Engine, there is no need to think about virtual machine images, operating systems, databases, Web servers, licensing, software updates/patches, load-balancing, or other hardware requirements. You just upload your code to Google: use our simple deployment system will have your app up and ready to serve the world generally in less than 60 seconds!. The conference was in Jun√≠n ( Buenos Aires, Argentina ) in Septiembre 2011, and it was managed by PyAr ( Python Argentina ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The with statement is relatively recent, having been introduced into Python by PEP 343 and making its debut in Python 2.5. You have likely now used it or seen it used with files. Those who are long-time members of the Python community are getting with it now (pun indented). What's a &amp;quot;context manager&amp;quot; anyway, and why can't I use any Python object with with unless it has one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll go over the background on it, covering the motivation behind context management, and how the with statement uses it and follows the RAII concept where &amp;quot;resource allocation is initialization.&amp;quot; We'll describe what Python objects you can use with the with statement, and show you how to add context management to your own objects so you can use them with with. This includes writing your own context manager class as well as short-form alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Did you know Google has various open source libraries that help you do exactly that? Users who may have tried &amp;amp; failed, run into roadblocks, been confused about using our APIs, or had issues with authentication are welcome to come and make these non-issues moving forward. Finally, we'll demo using multiple Google APIs to give you an idea of what it's all about!&lt;/p&gt;
