most projects that interact with external users. Python's type system is
already widely used for readability, refactoring, and bug detection —
this talk will demonstrate how types can also be leveraged to make your
project systematically more secure. We'll investigate (1) how static
type checkers like Pyre or MyPy can be extended with simple library
modifications to catch vulnerable patterns, and (2) how deeper
type-based static analysis can reliably flag remaining use cases to
security engineers. As an example, I'll focus on a basic security
problem and how you might use both tools in combination, drawing from
our experience deploying these methods to build more secure applications
at Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

This tutorial will introduce you to type annotations in Python. We’ll cover basic ideas about how types work in a dynamic language like Python, and where explicit annotations can provide value. We’ll then explore features of the type system in more depth, and demonstrate how they can be used to precisely yet flexibly express a huge range of programming patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the tutorial, you will have the chance to get your hands dirty by learning how to add types to small code snippets as well as to an example GitHub project, and run a type checker to see errors as you code. You’ll get to practice and play around with each concept as we discuss it, and walk away with concrete experience adding types to and catching bugs in real code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A laptop with Python installed is required along with internet access.&lt;/p&gt;
