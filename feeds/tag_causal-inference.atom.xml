We will introduce typical problems where causal ML can be applied and will specifically do a deep dive on root cause analysis using DoWhy. To do this, we will lay out what typical problem spaces for causal ML look like, what kind of problems we're trying to solve, and then show how to use DoWhy's API to solve these problems. Expect to see a lot of code with a hands-on example. We will close this session by zooming out a bit and also talk about the PyWhy organization governing DoWhy.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, an alternative approach towards it, quasi-experimental frameworks, is discussed. Additionally, I will present how to adjust well-known machine-learning algorithms so they can be used to quantify causal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
