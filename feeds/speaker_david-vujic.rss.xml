Is functional programming even applicable with the idea of writing Pythonic code, or the Zen of Python? These things have been on my mind lately, since I have switched from Clojure to writing full time Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will share my thoughts and ideas on how to find a possible way to be both Pythonic, and Functional. I will demo how to get super fast feedback loops during development by using a thing called REPL Driven Development, keeping it Pythonic while adding functional patterns like Railway Oriented Programming, and demo some really cool Python specific tools such as the toolz library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
