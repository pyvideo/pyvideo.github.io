In 2016 and 2017, Texas Tech University Atmospheric Science researchers deployed semi-permanent StickNet weather stations to record fine-scale atmospheric data. Python tools were utilized and developed to visualize the weather conditions occurring at each individual station as well as provide a comprehensive look over the entire StickNet domain. Examples of how Python is used to create real-time meteograms and display NWS radar data from the NEXRAD Amazon Web Services archive will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;
