preserving computation including homomorphic encryption, secret sharing,
and differential privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will explore current uses of privacy preserving computation, in
fields such as government, finance, telecommunications and IoT. We will
look at the technological and social barriers to wider adoption then
gaze into the crystal ball to see where the future might take us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude we will explore one technique (partially homomorphic
encryption) with a motivating medical example. A high level overview of
the open source library &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;python-paillier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; will be given along with a
few code samples showing how easy (some) privacy preserving analytics

image processing in neuroscience. However, each package has its own
strengths and limitations depending on the purpose of the analysis.
After testing many of them at work, we have found a need to develop our
own packages (at the Brain Imaging Laboratory, MBC). We will expose a
couple of python tools that could be handy for anyone dealing with
neuroscience (or medical images in general) in their projects. The tools
presented are for (i.) quick image viewing, (ii.) dicom image sorting
and de-identifying and (iii.) automatic email notifications to alert
about server warnings (e.g., if machine is down, close to full capacity,
failing to connect to local image archiving network (PACS), etc..).
While many of these tools could have been written in other programming
languages, we will explain the reasons for choosing python, share a bit
about our python learning journey and perform a brief demonstration on
the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

From the
schema change itself to keeping test (and user!) data in sync with the

is paracetamol for this change management headache. Alembic is a
companion package to sqlalchemy for creating database schema migrations.
This talk will introduce alembic, demonstrate how it is used to generate
schema deltas and migrate database schemas. The talk will discuss
manually adding data migration to a schema migration script and describe
how using alembic has changed our development process. Some familiarity
with databases and sqlalchemy will be assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

thing in Python, or the harbinger of doom upon our entire community.
Which is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing optional static typing in Python will bring with it some
benefits that other languages have had for years: IDEs will be able to
do code completion better; a whole class of boring tests will fall out
automatically; and some bugs will be easier to catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is also undeniably a huge change of direction: will it mean you
have to substantially change your code style? Will Python's simple
expressiveness suddenly become unattainable thanks to clumsy Java-style
type declarations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show how PEP 484's Gradual Typing system works, we're going to look
at TypeScript, a minimal implementation of Gradual Typing over
JavaScript. We'll see how the type system works, and how it fits into
the already thriving JavaScript developer community, where most people
aren't using type hints at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll draw some parallels with how Python's implementation will work,
and see what Python can learn from a language that has successfully made
the jump to a type-hinted world.&lt;/p&gt;

You need to know everything, they don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odds aren't in your favour. You're eventually going to get hacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the bad news. But if you stop thinking about a security
compromise as &amp;quot;that thing you close your eyes and hope never happens&amp;quot;,
and instead start thinking about it as an inevitability, then you can
start making better security decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If they compromise my web servers, how do I protect my application
servers?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If they break my application server code, how can I prevent them from
gaining a foothold on my infrastructure?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If they poison my web-site with cross-site scripting, how do I find out
before my users get hurt?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: &amp;quot;If I'm going to get hacked, how do I make it hurt less?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, I said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s 2015, and still the vast majority of Python programmers write
essentially synchronous code that blocks on network I/O. This approach,
while simple to reason about, struggles mightily with scaling up and out
into software that does a lot of network I/O. Worse, it makes it
difficult to write code that reacts rapidly to changing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing is on the wall for this kind of software, as the community
shifts towards writing software that embraces asynchronicity. In this
talk weâ€™ll discuss why synchronous software is a problem, what your
options are to move away from it, and what challenges are being faced by
the Python ecosystem as we try to move towards a brave new asynchronous
world.&lt;/p&gt;

itself, and largely unnecessary. The solutions proposed by the
developers of MPI and the new languages in this space are all addressing
the problem the way it's always been addressed. What I present is a way
to attack the massively parallel problem that reduces the complexity of
MPI programming to that of implementing a very simple state machine.
I've used this combination of MPI and IoC to write state-of-the-art
applications that run on some of the largest supercomputers around the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, micro-services have been gaining popularity due
to their advantages over traditional monolithic architectures. It
becomes easier to horizontally scale the heavier portions of an
application; you're not tied to the same OS or programming language for
the entire application, meaning you can easily slot in the best tool for
the job; and finally, you can quickly build the entire application in
dynamic yet less performant languages, then rebuild any bottlenecks with
faster (but slower to develop) languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a basic example, rather than directly communicating with a database
for user authentication, a web front-end would make an HTTP request to
another lightweight REST service to check credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="an-example-application"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;An Example Application&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to elucidate the difference between monolithic and
micro-services, we will use a simple Social-Network web application that
allows users to post 141 character messages. A user must first sign up,
then log in with a username and password, then they can post their
messages publicly. A user can then follow any other user, and receive
real time updates when that user posts. While the behaviour is simple,
there are a number of different concepts that are explored: template
rendering, user signup and authentication, data storage and notification
delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-monolithic-version"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Monolithic Version&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version of the will be a single Django application. The talk
does not go into detail on the source code, instead briefly discusses
the views, databases (tables and queries) and overall architecture at a
high level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-http-micro-service-version"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The HTTP Micro-Service Version&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to deconstruct the monolith into micro-services, we look at
different functions of the application: message viewing, user signup and
authentication, data storage and search, and user notification. Django
is kept as the front-end, but the databases for authentication, data
storage and searching and user-follows are each transformed into their
own micro-service. Flask is used as the HTTP framework for these
services, with SQLAlchemy for database as necessary. Some source code is
discussed (mostly in terms of standard Django database access c.f. HTTP)
but this is also quite high level. The talk will also cover what HTTP
comes with &amp;quot;out of the box&amp;quot;, in terms of authentication, deployment and
scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="alternative-transports"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Alternative Transports&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the micro-services have been split, we can start to think about
different transports that might be more appropriate (or at least more
interesting) in some circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="introducing-a-message-queue"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Introducing a Message Queue&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a user perspective, HTTP is a synchronous protocol, so making other
synchronous HTTP calls inside an HTTP handler doesn't introduce much
complexity. Message queues, on the other hand, are asynchronous by
nature. We look at using message queues for delegating user
notifications (which don't require a response, and are easy to handle),
then for authentication, data storage and searching â€“ each requiring a
slightly different &amp;quot;level&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;synchronicity&amp;quot; and a need to be
shoehorned into HTTP differently. We'll look at code for message
producing and consuming and discuss architecture again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Message queues are already widely used for handling intensive background
tasks, so we'll look at how they compare to HTTP in this application
(for security and deployment), and briefly also talk about
cross-platform compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lower-down-the-stack-raw-sockets"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Lower Down the Stack - Raw Sockets&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, for some reason, the overhead of HTTP or a message queue is too
high, direct socket communication might be better. We'll look at a
Python TCP server for user authentication, and a UDP server for handling
user notifications, and example code for both. Also discussed are the
security implications (it's DIY all the way), performance, and how you
might scale these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we'll look at a comparison overview for all these different
methods and summarise with the pros and cons of each.&lt;/p&gt;

Service (PaaS) for hosting Django apps, and you can run it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Nginx, Circus, Chaussette, and Django, with some support from
Django-environ and deployment automation using Fabric. All of that
except Nginx are written in Python. Systemd is a new init process
coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circus is a process and socket manager, and gives a nice way to scale
processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chaussette WSGI server works well with Circus, as Circus can pass the
socket to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django-environ it's a library that parses environment variables or
files with key-value pairs. Environment variables are used on some
PaaS, but the file support I find very useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fabric is a framework for writing system commands to be run on remote
hosts, and is great for automating system administration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systemd is a new &amp;quot;init&amp;quot; process for Linux and offers some interesting
possibilities for hosting Python webapps.&lt;/li&gt;

aspiring programmers of much younger ages than most contemporary
languages, and the skill set attained from learning to program may
include basic problem solving, mathematics and even literacy. We have
conducted several workshops with diverse groups of primary school
children in years 4 to 6, attempting to teach elementary programming
skills using Python. The goals of the workshops were to promote numeracy
and literacy in Tasmanian schools, where there may be lower rates of
competency in these areas. We wanted to do this through the use of a
formal, syntax-dependent language, which could have benefits related to
natural language skills and literacy. To engage our students we
constructed exercises in different topics, that lead to children being
able to modify a small, simple and modular game using PyGame for Python
2.7. In some of these exercises, the students created elementary
programs to answer simple math questions and participated in group
exercises to make modifications to one version of the game (adding
characters, dialogue and interactions) before being able to modify their
own version. In these sessions we found participants to engage well with
the source material despite being reasonably advanced, with teaching
staff making comparisons between accurate python syntax and
grammatically correct English.&lt;/p&gt;

strengths and weaknesses. My background is in Java â€“ however more
recently I have moved onto using Python, JavaScript and PHP, whilst
dabbling in Go. My talk will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asynchronous programming, and the various ways it can be written in
code, with reference to JavaScript and Go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packaging, how some languages do it better and worse than Python, and
what Python can learn from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit testing in all languages is hard, but the syntactic sugar that
is added can ease the pain, and make the output when your tests
inevitably fail easier to read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax Shock, what brackets and semi-colons? Why are you not running
â€“ oh yes I need a semi-colon there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cool stuff with Magic(al) methods and Duck Typing that languages like
Java would not have a hope of implementing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will highlight some of the delight I get when coming back to
Python; and some of the aspects of other languages that I think would be
really cool to add.&lt;/p&gt;
