We'll cut through the jargon and focus on when blockchain makes sense and when it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything we build will use Python, using libraries and patterns you already know, plus a few lightweight tools to interact with the Algorand blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll work through hands-on examples: coding trust into peer-to-peer payment systems for underbanked regions, building fractional ownership for previously illiquid assets, and creating self-sovereign digital identity systems that empower users with ownership of their credentials. These aren't hypotheticals—companies are running these solutions in production today, and we'll break down how they do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect a session that meets you where you are: practical, approachable, and 100% Python. By the end, you'll see where blockchain fits into your toolkit—not as a magic bullet, but as a practical option for specific, thorny problems.&lt;/p&gt;
