simplifies cloud-based distributed computing by programmatically
executing user-defined functions (UDFs) in AWS Batch. It takes as input
a Python function, packages it as a container, creates all the necessary
AWS constituent resources to submit jobs, monitors their execution and
gathers the results, all from within the Python environment. Cloudknot
overcomes limitations of previous similar libraries, such as pywren,
that runs UDFs on AWS Lambda, because most data science workloads exceed
the AWS Lambda limits on execution time, RAM, and local
storage.Presenter(s): Speaker: Adam Richie- Halford, University of
