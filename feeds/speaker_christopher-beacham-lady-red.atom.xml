This allows us the luxury of controlling them with Python!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll teach you about how to get the the hardware, how to think about programming for lights and how to build anything from a psychedelic art installation to home lighting to an educational tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming with lights is awesome because you can SEE bugs with your eyes. I think the use of these LED's have great potential as a teaching tool because of the immediacy of the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LIVE hardware demos!  See Quicksort in brilliant colors!&lt;/p&gt;
