of courses on the Coursera platform (www.py4e.com). This course has
impacted over 2 million students over the last five years. We will look
a the history and goals of the course and how the course works to create
a learning community. We will show how the free open educational
resources (OERs) and book associated with the course have been used by
teachers, students, and courses around the world to form a network of
educational activities centered around Python. We will also cover
briefly the Tsugi (www.tsugi.org) software that is used to build the
learning assessments and distribute the OER materials in a way that
enables maximum reusability of the materials for other teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
