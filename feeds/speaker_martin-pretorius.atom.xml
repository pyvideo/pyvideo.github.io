number crunching and data analysis, we looked around for another
solution in the data analysis and modelling space. We quickly found that
with packages and tools like Numpy, Pandas, the iPython Notebook and new
packages like Blaze, Python looked to be a good language fit. Porting a
large existing codebase and accompanying infrastructure from a Ruby to
Python ecosystem simply wasn't an option, so we had to do something
clever (and fun!). This talk will be about how we managed to leverage
the power of Python while retaining our modelling code in Ruby (and
opening up opportunity for other languages), by embracing Lispâ€™s
code-is-data philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
