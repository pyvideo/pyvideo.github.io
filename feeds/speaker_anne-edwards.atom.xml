particularly glamorous, and tends not to get much love: the humble
release note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined my current company back in September 2017, I noticed we
didn’t have a consistent format for our release notes, and they were
often clunky and difficult to understand. And when I did a bit of
research to see if there were any generally accepted formats, I was
surprised at how little guidance I found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised I had plenty of my own ideas about what made a good release
note (from reading and writing many over the years), so I gathered them
together and gradually formed them into a style guide. Drawing from
this, I’ll talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making release notes easier to write ‐ and read ‐ by grouping them
into categories and then using templates to write them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how you can improve readability with a few simple style tweaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;viewing release notes as a ready‐made opportunity to show your users
the hard work you’ve put into your product ‐ the bugs you’ve fixed,
and the suggestions you’ve listened to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
