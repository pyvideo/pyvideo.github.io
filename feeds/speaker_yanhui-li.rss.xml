developer can live without the language's rich library ecosystem.
Unfortunately, as the number of libraries increases, so does the risk of
cross-library incompatibilities, or &amp;quot;dependency hell&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dependency hell arises when two libraries have mutually conflicting
requirements. These can be very difficult for developers to diagnose and
may not be fixable without avoiding certain libraries entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this talk, you - the library author - will have a practical set of
simple best practices to follow that will allow you to build libraries
that are compatible across the Python ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
