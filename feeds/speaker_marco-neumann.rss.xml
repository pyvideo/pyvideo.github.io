and engineering work. This choice, together with Python as an underlying
programming language gives us flexibility, a feature-rich interface, and
access to a large community and ecosystem. When it comes to preserving
the data and exchanging it with different software stacks, we rely on
Parquet Datasets / Hive Tables. During the write process, there is a
shift from a rather weakly typed world to a strongly typed one. For
example, Pandas may convert integers to floats for many operations
without asking, but parquet files and the schema information stored
alongside them dictate very precise types. The type situation may get
even more &amp;quot;colorful&amp;quot;, when datasets are written by multiple code
versions or different software solutions over time. This then results in
important questions regarding type compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will first represent an overview on types at different layers
(like NumPy, Pandas, Arrow and Parquet) and the transition between this
layers. The second part of the talk will present examples of type
compatibility we have seen and why+how we think they should be handled.
At the end there will be a Q+A, which can be seen as the start of a
potentially longer RFC process to align different software stacks (like
Hive and Dask) to handle types in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
