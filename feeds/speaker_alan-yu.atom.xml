Their work is heavily inspired by nteract's papermill, which allows for the parameterization, execution, and analysis of Jupyter notebooks. Notebook operationalization opens many doors for team's troubleshooting pipelines, and we wanted to learn more from the open source community for how we can work together to empower developers who are on-call. Join us for this code-focused session to hear about our journey of listening and learning to the open source community, and how we used Python to evolve notebook parameterization.&lt;/p&gt;
