Drupal and Django have much in common. They’re both open source tools for building the web. They’re also marked by some fundamental differences. However, both are so much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret!&amp;quot; - Charles Dickens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore the darkly clustered houses of these two different communities of open source people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What common challenges do we face?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What different approaches do we take?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can we learn from each other?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, what could we do together?&lt;/p&gt;

The user story sits at the centre of most agile development methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what makes a good story? and where do stories come from? What do we do with them once they've been estimated, prioritised, re-sized and broken down? How can we maintain our sense of the big picture when it's broken down into tiny puzzle pieces? How does that help us build good products?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk puts the focus on the &amp;quot;user&amp;quot; telling the story to understand their requirements for the product. It then turns back to the team to look at how we hear and discuss those stories in order to bring them to life to build the product, and build it right.&lt;/p&gt;
