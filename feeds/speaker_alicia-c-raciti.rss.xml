&lt;p&gt;User experience(UX) has come to the forefront of the design world over the last 5-10 years. As the internet and its content have evolved, we’re asking now more than ever about user goals when they visit the websites and software we create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UX terms like Information Architecture, Interaction Design, and Research are regularly thrown around, but what are they and how does it impact a site and product?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will define UX and it’s sub-disciplines to bring understanding to what UX is. Practical deliverables will be shared in an effort to give attendees something that they can begin to implement into their process.&lt;/p&gt;
