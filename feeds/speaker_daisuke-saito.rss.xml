&lt;p&gt;I have been using Ren'Py for eight years in Doujin activities. Ren'Py is Python based visual novel game engine. In the past eight years, I felt many benefits using Ren'Py. This talk demonstrates the benefits of using it. The author also describes how Ren'Py evolved from the user's point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lecture will give a practical report on programming education using Python for elementary school
students. Programming education for elementary school students often uses block-based programming
languages such as Scratch. In contrast, I chose to teach with Python in order to provide the students
with insights into computer and hardware mechanisms. In this report, I share an educational method
for teaching programming, using Python, to elementary school students. In addition, I report the
difficulties associated with teaching Python to elementary school students.&lt;/p&gt;
