I visualized the impact of lockdown on human movements by writing Python algorithms to measure the reduction in seismic vibrations using data from seismic stations across Canada. I created a web application so that anyone can visualize the seismic silences and is available at www.MonitorMyLockdown.com&lt;/p&gt;
