future analysis and increases the accuracy of your machine learning
model. It’s important to know what goes into the bag of words and what
are some potential do's and don'ts of text pre-processing. Which text
normalization steps are necessary and which ones are “nice-to-have”? Why
is classic NLP still relevant in the age of Deep Learning? What metrics
can be used to compare word frequencies and what can machine learning
algorithms do with those numbers? This NLP talk provides answers to
these questions and more! You'll see three examples of NLP pipelines
using spaCy: sentiment analysis and emoji in tweets, named entity
recognition in Yelp reviews, and multilingual topic modeling for news
articles.&lt;/p&gt;
