experiences as compared to their traditional alternatives. This talk
aims to show off some of those modern terminal tools and compare them
side by side with the traditional ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is not only used by software developers with fancy IDEs but also
by DevOps engineers, administrators, and on remote development machines
where using a GUI is impractical. Therefore, many people are stuck with
a terminal interface only and have to use tools like vim, grep, find,
wc, cloc, less and many others to explore their way around their Python
programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, thanks to the advent of many new and improved tools, we can do
many of the same tasks better, faster and with nicer ergonomics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will show off effective use of vim as an IDE with completions
and linting provided by LSP, fd (instead of find) for finding files,
ripgrep (instead of grep) for searching strings, tokei (instead of cloc)
for counting lines of code, bat (instead of cat) for looking at files,
hyperfine for microbenchmarking, httpie (instead of curl) for making
HTTP requests, sd (instead of sed) for text replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk should make terminal work more approachable for all attendees
by showing off how to do some everyday tasks on the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will be a getting start guide on controlling hardware devices with Python. We know Python users are very keen on multitasking and always wish to know more about how it can be used in different tasks. This talk will help audiences exploring new Python skillset. Audiences may be inspired by this talk and apply it to many scenarios, e.g., IoT and infrastructure automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intended audiences include:
1. wish to know how Python can be used beyond data analysis and web dev
2. a Pythonista who interested in craft some touchable things
3. want to acquire something new into your Python skillset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audiences are expected to have basic knowledge about:
1. Python syntax and control flow
2. Computer and operating system (especially UNIX)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this talk, audiences will have:
1. The basic idea of controlling devices with Python
2. Expanding their Python skillset. Know how to use Python in another interesting and useful task besides ML, web scrapping, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
