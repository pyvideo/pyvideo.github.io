Batteries Included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented by Michael Carter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to supercharge your python web applications (Django, Pylons,
TG, GAE, Werkzeug, WSGI, etc) with real-time features! Presenceful and
moderated chat? About 10 minutes, seriously. A real-time graph to
monitor the CPU? Less than five. If you pay attention for at least half
of this talk, you'll leave confident and ready to take advantage of
WebSocket, Comet, and the world, thanks to Hookbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hookbox (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hookbox.org/"&gt;http://hookbox.org&lt;/a&gt;) is a Python and
Eventlet- based Comet-server/message-queue which tightly integrates with
existing web application infrastructure via web hooks and a REST
interface; Hookbox’s purpose is to ease the development of real-time web
applications, with an emphasis on tight integration with existing web
technology. Put simply, Hookbox is a web-enabled message queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browers may directly connect to Hookbox, subscribe to named channels,
and publish and receive messages on those channels in real-time. An
external application (typically the web application itself) may also
publish messages to channels by means of the Hookbox REST interface. All
authentication and authorization is performed by an external web
application via designated “webhook” callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we cover the broad principles of Hookbox, then examine a
few short examples in depth, including presenceful and moderated chat,
real-time graphing, and, of course, a game. The code examples are very
purposefully brief; the important parts of the talk deal with the
interaction model between browser, web framework, and Hookbox --
everything else follows naturally and easily into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience need not be familiar with a particular web framework over
another, but they must be proficient with at least one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this talk is aimed at a novice level, we'll also spend some time
talking about the more advanced features that Hookbox provides.&lt;/p&gt;
