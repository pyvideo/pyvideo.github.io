Then, we will start building the BeeWare UI and link it up with the already working Django app. After building our example, we will also discover other alternatives that BeeWare can work with Django so in the future, if you are building another BeeWare app, you can decide which method you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

problem that human encounter since we start use computer to handle data.
Unlike numerical value which has an exact logic to compare them, it is
very hard to say how alike two strings are for a computer. One may
compare them character by character and have an idea of how many
characters in the pair of stings are the same. Unfortunately in most
application we need computer to perceive strings like we do and
therefore we have to use fuzzy matching. Fuzzy matching on names is
never straight forward though, the definition of how “difference” of two
names are really depends case by case. For example with restaurant
names, matching of words like “cafe” “bar” and “restaurant” are consider
less valuable then matching of some other less common words. Also, do we
consider company names that matches partly (like “Happy Unicorn company”
and Happy Unicorn co.”) are the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of the talk Levenshtein Distance, a measure of the
similarity between two strings, will be explained. Different functions
in Fuzzywuzzy like “partial &lt;em&gt;ratio” and “token&lt;/em&gt; sort_ratio” will also
be explored and compared for difference. It is very important to
understand our tool and choose the right one for our task. Then in the
second half, we will start tackling the example problem: matching
company names, we will show that besides using Fuzzywuzzy, we have to
also handle problem like finding and avoid matching of common words and
speeding up the matching process by grouping the names. By combining all
tricks and techniques that we demonstrate, we will also evaluate how
efficient this method is and the advantage of using this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for people in all level of Python experience who would like
to learn a trick or two and would like to be able to solve similar
problems in the future. Theory of how the library works will be
explained and It is easy to be pick up even for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start, we will be using &lt;cite&gt;dir&lt;/cite&gt; to look into the secret functions Python objects have. Eg:
&lt;cite&gt;__getitem__&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;__iter__&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;__next__&lt;/cite&gt; Then, we will investigate where is the dunder function goes? Why is it not accessible. And at the end, we will see how dunder functions can change the identity of the Python objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for attendees who have just begin their Python journey. By explaining the dunder functions and the nature of Python objects, attendees will have a better understanding of why Python is fundamentally different from other programming languages. Hopefully, this knowledge will help them out when they continue their Python journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

Intelligence, people hope to get information out of the structure of an
organization or a communication network. In this talk, we use the hotel
room search requests from travel agents, including online public
website, B2C, B2B and B2B2C, to build a relational network among them.
By using this network as an example, we demonstrate how insights can be
extract by studying network properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of the talk, we will explain how the network is built
using NetworkX, an open-source python library that is designed for the
creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and
functions of complex networks. When 2 agents are making the same search
at the same time , a link ( or an “edge” in network analysts terms) is
made pointing form the initial searcher to the subsequent searcher.
Using a list of these searches, a directed graph is built. We will also
demonstrate how to pick the biggest connected component out form the
graph. In the second half, with the graphs created, we show how
different functions of NetworkX can be used to study the graphs. By
compare the graph properties of our graph to the other popular network
graphs, we can get the insight of how the network was created. Also by
studying the graphs, we can understand the behavior of the agents and
can even figure out which agents are acting as main hubs in the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for people who are interested in network analysis and would
like to see how it can be used in a business case. Audiences with any
level of python experience can learn some basic concept of network
analysis work and how it can be applied to provide business insights.&lt;/p&gt;

As protesters are mainly young, educated and technology-aware people, they are trying to use the new technology to outwit the government which also use AI and technology to control its people. Who got the upper hand?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever think about using Tinder to look for a ‘date’ in the protest? Or using Uber to call for a free ride to drive you to safety?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the talk, we will cover the background of the protest, why it happened and how it is started. We will briefly talk about the politic environment of Hong Kong and what causes the protest 1: the fear of losing a “high degree of autonomy”
In the second part, which is the main part of the talk, we will cover how technology/ apps like Telegram, Tinder, Pokemon Go, Twitch, AirDrop, Bridgefy, Uber, etc were used in by the protesters and what
role they play in the protest. People use Telegram’s encryption to communicate without worrying leaking of identity; they use Tinder to spread the news about where and when to protest; They use Pokemon Go
to gather people 4; AirDrop to spread the message to the Chinese tourists; Bridgefy to communicate where internet is not available at crowded areas 3; Uber to let the protested know where there are
volunteer drivers to take you to safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third part, we will have a look at what technology the Chinese government may use to tighten its grip over Hong Kong. One of the front lines of the protest in the online activism 5, the Chinese
government has it’s own ‘50 cent army’ which is also known as ‘China bots’ who were paid to leave pro-CCP comments on social media. Which eventually cause Twitter and Facebook to shout down lots of accounts. Also, there are attacks cyberattacks, suspected to be related to the protest, towards Telegram and an online forum LiHKG which the protesters used to communicate. It is also suspected that the
government installed ‘smart’ lamppost which use facial detection to monitor the citizen of Hong Kong after protested found parts made by a Shanghai company which also made the surveillance cameras in mainland China 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for audients who are interested to know how our lives are changed by technology and how they could influence our society. By the end of the talk, audients will be more aware of what consequence new technology may bring us and be more thoughtful about the ethics behind the implementation of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

We will start the talk with a basic explanation of how Python arrange memories for various objects. This lays the foundation explanation of why we need a special tool to memory profile Python programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we will be going through a data science use case where we memory profiles some part of the process with the Memray Jupyter plug-in. This would be a use case that a data science practitioner or learner would be familiar with and they can see how memory profiling could be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will then explain how to interpret the frame diagram in Memray, a commonly used diagram in memory profiling to understand how much memory a process and its sub-process uses. This is something that for a new user, it could be hard to understand and not know what to look into. From this example, audiences can see what they can learn about from the frame diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#### Goal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for data scientists, learners or anyone who is interested in memory profiling their Python program. Although the talk will be using a data science use case as an example, the explanation and the tool can be expanded to be used in any Python program. However, for data science practitioners and learners who have been using Python to process data, this may be a step forward for them to improve their data workflow and prevent memory leaks from their programs.&lt;/p&gt;

First of all, we will touch upon the background knowledge of the Python GIL, what is it and why it is needed. On the contrary, why it is stopping multi-threaded CPU processes to take advantage of multi-core machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we will have a look at no-gil Python, a fork of CPython 3.9 by Same Gross. How it provides an alternative to using Python with no GIL and demonstrates it could be the future of the newer versions of Python. With that, we will try out this version of Python in some popular yet calculation-heavy algorithms in scientific programming and data sciences e.g. PCA, clustering, categorization and data manipulation with Scikit-learn and Pandas. We will compare the performance of this no-gil version with the original standard CPython distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for Pythonistas who have intermediate knowledge of Python and are interested in using Python for scientific programming or data science. It may shine some light on having a more efficient way of using Python in their tasks and interest in trying the no-gil version of Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will use a task: hiring a GPU on Google Cloud Platform to train neural network, as an example to show how an application can be deployed on a cloud platform with Docker and Terraform. The goal is to have Jupyter Notebook running in an environment with Tensorflow (GPU version) and other libraries installed on a Google Compute Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for people with no experience in application deployment on cloud service but would benefit form computational reproducibility and cloud service, potentially data scientists/ analysts or tech practitioners who didn't have a software developing background. We will use an example that is simple but useful in data science to demonstrate basic usage of Docker and Terraform which would be beneficial to beginners who would like to simplify their work flow with those tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how many times you look up “how to do this in pandas”? Though it is the most popular data handling library in Python, it is quite complicated due to the rigidness of storing data in tabular formats. This is most obvious when the data stored is imported from a JSON file and end up having multiple layers of objects. At this point, you wished for a data structure that let you store data with objects and subclasses, just like in object-orientated programs. The answer? Semantic knowledge graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Cheuk will first introduce what is semantic knowledge graphs. It’s building block: triples, and how all data can be described will them - with objects and properties. Cheuk will assume no prior knowledge and will explain via examples and visualization with the TerminusDB model builder - a graphical interface that allows you to build schemas for semantic knowledge graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next part, Cheuk will show how to construct a schema based on a pandas DataFrame. With the Python client of TemrinusDB, schema can be built programmatically follow by importing the data in the DataFrame. In this part, basic Python knowledge is assumed. In this part, Cheuk will show the internals of pandas, dissecting it and reconstruct a knowledge graph schema. Cheuk will also show the code that transforms the data and insert them in the prepared graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Cheuk will visualize the graph in a customized interactive graph visualization in Jupyter notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For time series analysis, everyone’s talking about ARIMA or
Holt-Winters. But there’s other models which could also break down a
seasonal series into trend, seasonality and noise. We will use an open
source Python library called Seasonal to analyse B2B worldwide travel
data.&lt;/p&gt;

So do we still have a problem in, especially gender, diversity? We will look at some data and see if there’s a true problem, discuss what the problem may be and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

But instead of the example-based tests that we normally write, have you heard of property-based testing? By using Hypothesis, instead of thinking about what data I should test it for, it will generate test data, including boundary cases, for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will explore what is property-based testing and why it can do a lot of heavy lifting in writing tests for us. As a contributor, I will introduce Hypothesis, a Python library that can help perform property-based tests with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the talk, we will understand the power of property-based tests, what is it, how is it different from what we “normally do” - testing by example, and why is it useful in testing our code. This will be followed by demonstrations using Hypothesis. With a few examples, we will have a glimpse of how to create strategies - recipes for describing the test data you want to generate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we will also explore the Ghostwriters in Hypothesis which will actually write the test for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for Pythonistas who are new to property-based testing and found thinking of what parameters to use for testing a difficult task. This talk may provide them with a new approach to writing tests, which will be more efficient for some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

demonstrates the GIL can be removed. For scientific programs which use
heavy CPU-bound processes, it could be a huge performance improvement.
In this talk, we will see if this is true and compare the nogil version
to the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will have a look at what is no-gil Python and how it
may improve the performance of some scientific calculations. First of
all, we will touch upon the background knowledge of the Python GIL, what
is it and why it is needed. On the contrary, why it is stopping
multi-threaded CPU processes to take advantage of multi-core machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we will have a look at no-gil Python, a folk of CPython 3.9
by Same Gross. How it provides an alternative to using Python with no
GIL and demonstrates it could be the future of the newer versions of
Python. With that, we will try out this version of Python in some
popular yet calculation-heavy algorithms in scientific programming and
data sciences e.g. PCA, clustering, categorization and data manipulation
with Scikit-learn and Pandas. We will compare the performance of this
no-gil version with the original standard CPython distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for Pythonistas who have intermediate knowledge of Python
and are interested in using Python for scientific programming or data
science. It may shine some light on having a more efficient way of using
Python in their tasks and interest in trying the no-gil version of
Python.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you
want to know why and how to improve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, we will introduce Numba - a JIT compiler that is
designed to speed up numerical calculations. Most people found all of it
is like a mystery - It sounds like magic, but how does it work? Under
what conditions does it work? And because of it, new users found it hard
to start using it and it requires a steep learning curve to get the hang
of it. This workshop will provide all the knowledge that you need to
make Numba works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop is for Data scientists or developers who have math-heavy
code that would like to speed up with the benefit of Numpy and Numba.&lt;/p&gt;

supply chain. There are over 400,000 Python packages on Python Package
Index (PyPI) and many more on other registries like conda-forge, mostly
for scientific libraries. Making sure this and the wider Python
ecosystem are secure is a huge job and requires consistent
contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to OpenSSF’s Alpha-Omega project and AWS, we now have a PSF
Security Developer-in-Residence and PyPI Safety &amp;amp; Security Engineer
whose responsibility includes a security audit of the PyPI codebase and
infrastructure, improving security practices, and establishing metrics
on security posture to show the impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will go over the work that has been done by the PSF
security team and what the best practices for Python library maintainers
and users are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="goal"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Goal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to draw awareness of security, especially in
Python's ecosystem. It highlights how PSF is helping the community, on
the other hand, it also provides advice for a user or community member
on what can be done to make sure they are using Python safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

and representation among its members. There are examples of success
stories such as PyCon US Charlas, PyLadies, Djangonaut, and Django
Girls. Yet in the Python podcast community, women are still
underrepresented, making up only 17% of invited guests among the popular
podcast series. Being a guest in a podcast is a privilege, and an
opportunity to influence the Python community. There are many women and
underrepresented group members who have made impactful contributions to
the Python community globally, and they deserve the recognition and to
be heard by the rest of us. Disheartened by the lack of representation
by women on Python podcasts, and inspired by others who have shown us
how diversity in the community can be improved through intentionality,
we decided to start a podcast with a goal to highlight their voices so
that they could receive the recognition they deserve. In this talk,earn
about them, and about our podcast series. We’ll also share how you can
further help out cause in improving representation and diversity in the
Python community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="goal"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Goal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To raise awareness of the underrepresentation of certain groups,

similar programming languages like C and C++ due to its robust compiler
checking and ownership rules to make sure memory is safe. Hence there
are more and more Python libraries that have been written in Rust
natively with a Python API interface. One of the tools that have been
driving this movement is PyO3, a toolset that proves Rust bindings for
Python and tools for creating native Python extension modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this interactive workshop, we will cover the very basics of using
PyO3. There will be hands-on exercises to go from how to set up the
project environment to writing a &amp;quot;toy&amp;quot; Python library written in Rust
using PyO3. We will cover a lot of expectations of the API provided by
PyO3 to create Python functions, modules, handling errors and converting
types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="goal"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Goal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give developers who are not familiar with PyO3 an introduction to
PyO3 so they can consider building their Python libraries with Rust to
make use of Rust's memory-safe property and parallelism ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="target-audiences"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Target audiences&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any developers who are interested in developing Python libraries using
Rust. It will be an advantage if the attendees are comfortable writing
in Rust. However, attendees are not required to be familiar with Rust as
all the Rust codes will be provided. Basic knowledge of Python will be
assumed from the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

Chatbot is cool! Now we can talk to our gadgets as if it’s a real human, right? It also makes you wonder when you chat with the “customer service” online, is that a real person or a robot on the other side? My boss wanted me to build a chatbot, and here’s 3 things that I discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

But can we even make them speak in particular ways, like as Trump or Shakespeare? In this hands on talk we will see how this is possible with the latest deep learning techniques combined with word embeddings and other advanced NLP technique.&lt;/p&gt;

Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversity, big deal! As an active members and event organisers (and also on the minority side of the gender) in the Python community, we have alway been concern by the question of: Do we truly have a problem in diversity? Especially, gender diversity. We would like to find out the truth, by data science, and see if we can find a clue why and how we can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we will show the research others did regarding the representation of women in the R and Python communities [1]. Then, we will show the research that we did based on our experience and statistic. Including static analysis of the speakers diversity (regarding gender) at major PyCon and PyData conferences. Finally, as we all care about diversity and want improvements, we would like to find out the reason and what we can do about it. We would propose what we, the minorities and allies, could do against this seemingly unbalance situation and make the community better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for all that who cares about diversity in our community.&lt;/p&gt;

It is used by
data scientists to manage, transform and inspect data. As more and more
open-source tools appear, it seems the spotlight has shifted and I would
love to shine some light on this tool that all should know.&lt;/p&gt;
