enable teaching web applications at scale. Web2py is unique in allowing
the easy packaging and sharing of applications. A student can write a
web app, package it into a single file, then share it; other students
can with the click of a mouse unpack and load the application, and use
it. This allows teaching web development in a peer-driven fashion:
students submit solutions to homework assignments, then review and grade
each other's work, in the process learning from studying the solutions
that other students submitted for the same problem. We have successfully
used this approach at UC Santa Cruz for three years now, in the process
building a tool, CrowdGrader, for the peer review and grading of the
applications. The talk will describe the peer-driven approach and the
tool, and present results on tool accuracy and student satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
