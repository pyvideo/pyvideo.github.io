That
means, the proteins that make up these organisms also evolved from an
ancient set. Over a few billion years, evolution improvised,
diversified, and specialized these proteins to meet lifeâ€™s demands. How
did evolution do this? To explore this question, we use Python to infer
ancient, ancestral proteins from modern protein families. We then
synthesize these ancestors in lab and identify key changes that led to
new evolutionary innovations. In this talk, we will resurrect an ancient
protein and trace its evolutionary history in a single Jupyter
