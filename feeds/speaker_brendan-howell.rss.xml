now, there was no simple integrated system that made it easy to get
started. PyCessing gives new users a simple integrated IDE and basic
multi-media functionality that get users going without the distraction
of complex tools or libraries. It is based on emulating the success that
Processing brought to teaching Java.&lt;/p&gt;
