&lt;p&gt;FastAPI is great, it helps many developers create REST APIs based on the OpenAPI standard and run them asynchronously. It has a thriving community and educational documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FastAPI does a great job of getting people started with APIs quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will point out some obstacles and dark spots that I wish we had known about before. In this talk we want to highlight solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FastAPI's extensive use of pydantic for data parsing, validation, transformation, and OpenAPI definition export.
* The role of starlette in managing routes and middleware, including insights into creating custom middleware.
A discussion on FastAPI's documentation and the importance of DocStrings for accurate documentation.
The application of the &amp;quot;Don't Repeat Yourself&amp;quot; (DRY) principle with Pydantic to create highly reusable model pools with inheritance for use in FastAPI.&lt;/p&gt;
