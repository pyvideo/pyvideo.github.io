students with the same background as mine would be interested in hearing
about how Data Science is a crucial tool in building a successful
startup and its influence on taking decision every day. As part of my
work I use python and scientific librairies ( pandas, scikit­learn) on a
daily basis as it is used both on our backend services as well as for
Data analysis. We tackle complex problems such as Dynamic Pricing
depending on local demand an supply, dispatching Drivers efficiently,
Matching multiple passenger routes together for or real time
ride­sharing product Lyft Line, real­time ETAs and traffic estimation…
The fact that a lot of or analyses use geolocation data adds a specific
component to it that leads to complex problems. Optimization is crucial
as it is beneficial for everyone in our Marketplace: Passenger can get
lower prices and better service, Drivers spend more time with someone in
their car and have higher earnings…&lt;/p&gt;
