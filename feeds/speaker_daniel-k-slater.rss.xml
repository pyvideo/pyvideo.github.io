&lt;p&gt;We will build an AI that can master the game of Pong in just 1 hour. In the course of this we will talk through some of the tools involved. Q-learning , Deep learning and Convolutional nets and how they fit into Pong. Most of the heavy lifting will be done using Google's recently released Tensorflow libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start by setting up a Python an agent in Pong that moves completely randomly. I will then talk over what Q-learning is and how it works and a bit about Convolutional nets. We will then build the actual agent using Tensorflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full code will be given, including links for downloading the resources required, so hopefully the audience can build this on their laptops. I would hope to give enough information that users will be able to make there own agents independently once finished.&lt;/p&gt;
