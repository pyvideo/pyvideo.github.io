After all you
don’t want to become the laughing stock on hacker news or cause your
company to loose billions in shareholder value. This talk won’t turn you
into a security specialist over night, but you will learn how to avoid
common mistakes in your daily work as developer or administrator. I’m
going to take you on a brief tour in secure software design, illustrate
various attack vectors, and point you to helpful tools and resources.
Topics include threat analysis, deployment, parsing, authentication,
TLS/SSL, crypto, and user interaction, with some real life examples from
my daily work.&lt;/p&gt;

long-distance wireless communication technology to the Royal Institution
in London. He was looking forward to roaring success, scientific
acclaim, and a string of wealthy new customers - but he didn’t count
upon falling victim to the first hack in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tale of business secrets, flame wars, stage magic, and
magnificent sideburns, direct from the records of Edwardian England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk highlights several of the lessons that the FLOSS and
information security communities can still learn from the fateful events
of 1903. Marconi’s tale is a master class in the necessity of open
source technology, as well as being a delightful introduction to the art
of vulnerability reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
