I think it's a big feature added to Python after a long time. In this talk, I will show you the basic usage of the feature with various sample code. Let's try to understand how to use Pattern Matching and start using it in 3.10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will introduce the motivation behind Strucral Pattern Matching from PEP.
Then I will explain the syntax and basic usage of Structural Pattern Matching.
Next I will show how to use the various patterns with sample code.
The patterns introduced are Literal, Capture, Wildcard, OR, Value, Group, Class, Sequence, Mapping, AS and Guards.&lt;/p&gt;
