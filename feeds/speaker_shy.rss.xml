&lt;p&gt;Managing server infrastructures (i.e. everything below the application stack) is a lot of work. There is hardware to install, operating systems to set up, IP addresses to assign and backup the manage; at the same time, there are more to manage as the business grows. This talk will present several Python-based tools (namely cloud-init, curtin, MAAS, and Ansible) can help manage the infrastructure (even if the fleet is too small to justify huge investment in automation), and take a look at how they work under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
