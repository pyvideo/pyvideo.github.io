[EuroPython 2016]
[21 July 2016]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/high-performance-python-on-intel-architecture"&gt;https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/high-performance-python-on-intel-architecture&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will give an overview about the IntelÂ® Distribution for
Python which delivers high performance acceleration of Python code on
Intel processors for scientific computing, data analytics, and machine
learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the talk, we'll look at the architecture of the
latest Intel processors, including the brand new Intel Xeon Phi, also
known as Knights Landing, a many-core processor, which was just
released end of June 2016.
In the second part, we will see which tools and libraries are
available from Intel Software to enable high performance Python code
on multi-core and many-core processors.&lt;/p&gt;
