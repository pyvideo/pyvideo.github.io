It uses and
inter-operates with several key scientific python packages: numpy,
pyfits, and scipy.&lt;/p&gt;

Observatory of Japan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ginga is a new astronomical image viewer written in python. It uses and
inter-operates with several key scientific python packages: numpy,
pyfits, and scipy. A key differentiator for this image viewer, compared
to older-generation FITS viewers, is that all the key components are
written as python classes, allowing for the first time a powerful FITS
image display widget to be directly embedded in, and tightly coupled
with, python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call Ginga a toolkit for programming FITS viewers because it includes
a choice of base classes for programming custom viewers for two
different modern widget sets: Gtk and Qt, available on the three common
desktop platforms. In addition, a reference viewer is included with the
source code based on a plugin architecture in which the viewer can be
extended with plugins scripted in python. The code is released under a
BSD license similar to other major python packages and is available on
github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ginga has been introduced only recently as a tool to the astronomical
community, but since SciPy has a developer focus this talk concentrates
on programming with the Ginga toolkit. We cover two cases: using the
bare image widget to build custom viewers and writing plugins for the
existing full-featured Ginga viewer. The talk may be of interest to
anyone developing code in python needing to display scientific image
(CCD or CMOS) data and astronomers interested in python-based quick look
and analysis tools.&lt;/p&gt;
