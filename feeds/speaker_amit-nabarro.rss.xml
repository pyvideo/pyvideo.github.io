With a plethora of different web frameworks aiming at varying audiences,
it has become a rather simple and well-documented process to develop
web applications and web services. So popular it has become that
the WSGI specification is the industry standard protocol for
developing web applications with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the WSGI standard is lacking with two major limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It supports only the ‘traditional’ synchronous http request-response
cycle thus creating a ‘glass ceiling’ with the amount of requests a
single server can handle – often described as the C10K problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not provide an easy and efficient way of developing two-way
communication between servers and clients. Often referred to as the
real-time web this capability has become increasingly popular
with modern web applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade multiple networking libraries have been developed
to address these limitations.
In this talk we will explore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is an asynchronous web server and how it differs from other,
WSGI-based web servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is concurrency and how it can help us achieve supreme performance
and scalability in our web applications. We will survey noteworthy
libraries which will help achieve true concurrency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to develop real-time communication, using web sockets,
with our Javascript application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concerns, limitations and pitfalls when developing asynchronous
web applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
