and millions of products sold. But that is not all: Cdiscount is also a
company where dozens of Data Scientists are daily challenged with a
massive amount of data coming from visitors, customers, its product
catalogue and internal search engine. Their goal: deliver performing and
innovating algorithms in a short delay. The Cdiscountâ€™s Data Science
teams use Python for both prototyping and production, trying to shorten
the path between a research idea and its industrialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we are going to present some examples of Python
applications in Cdiscount and we are going to focus on one in
particular: the keyword clusterisation in Google Ads campaigns using the
Word-2-Vec algorithm of the gensim package. The solution of this NLP
problem allows to use the signal of high-traffic keywords to predict the
performance of lower-traffic ones and improve the bidding.&lt;/p&gt;
