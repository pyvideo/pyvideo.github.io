So I set about learning how to code with R, supported by the generosity of the R community and a plethora of freely-available online resources. During my journey, I discovered that a mature data culture is underpinned by three components, but when I was asked to use my data skills to help out during a cyclone, I realised that I was missing one of the three. In this talk I discuss how I reached that point, and what I did about it.&lt;/p&gt;
