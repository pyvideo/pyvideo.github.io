The main issue was that I couldn't find a niche that allowed me to use my existing knowledge while learning the new language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shiny for Python is a great niche for R users because none of the Python web frameworks can do what Shiny can do. Additionally, almost all of your knowledge of the R package is applicable to the Python one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide an overview of the Python web application landscape and articulate what Shiny adds to this landscape, and then go through the five things that R users need to know before developing their first Shiny for Python application.&lt;/p&gt;
