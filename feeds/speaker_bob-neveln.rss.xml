ProofCheck: Checking Mathematical Proofs written in TeX</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2012/31-proofcheck-checking-mathematical-proofs-writ.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ProofCheck is a set of Python scripts which parse and check mathematics
written using TeX. Its homepage is www.proofcheck.org. Unlike computer
proof assistants which require immersion in the equivalent of a
programming language, ProofCheck attempts to handle mathematical
language formalized according to the author's preferences as much as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;
