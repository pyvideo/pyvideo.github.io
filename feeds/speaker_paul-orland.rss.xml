&lt;p&gt;Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS) is a free, open source plugin that turns Visual Studio into a Python IDE.  PTVS supports CPython as well as IronPython, and provides IDE features like Intellisense, debugging, and code-browsing for Python applications.  Python can be used to create apps for Windows 8.1 and RT, and it is a first-class language for Windows Azure, the Microsoft cloud.  In this talk, I will walk through several sample applications and show off some powerful PTVS features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Orland is co-founder and CTO at Tachyus, building software for the oil and gas industry to optimize energy production.  Formerly, he worked on the cloud tools team within Visual Studio at Microsoft, specifically building the IDE extension for browsing data stored in Windows Azure.  He worked on the same team as the Python Tools developers, and learned a thing or two from looking over their shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
