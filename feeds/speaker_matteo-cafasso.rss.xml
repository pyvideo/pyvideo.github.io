Matteo Cafasso - Hunting Malware with Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worms, Trojans, BotNets and Ransomware. These bad guys are quite known nowadays but how do they look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am gonna show one of the approaches IT Security experts employ to study these threats using open source Python technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation would be a live demo in which I'll execute some malware in a secure environment and show how it behaves and how to detect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show a Sandboxing technology developed within F-Secure named Sandboxed Execution Environment (SEE). SEE is a Python framework which allows to quickly build behavioural scanning engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEE will be used altogether with other open source technologies to show some recent malware to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author:  I am a software engineer working in F-Secure Labs. F-Secure Corporation is an IT security company based in Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among my duties, malware handling and analysis automation is one of the most interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I develop and maintain the main behavioural scanning engines within F-Secure back-end and SEE is one of their core technology.&lt;/p&gt;
