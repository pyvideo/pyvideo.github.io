language has its own sets of tools and edge cases that are worth
knowing. Python is one of many popular languages that is rarely the
focus in security training, but that doesn't mean python code is
automatically secure (no matter what the internet tells you). Learn why
people who say “pylint will help you with security” aren’t doing you any
favours, how to use Bandit for security-focused linting and talk about
other options for static analysis. Take a deeper look at why scanning
for publicly known vulnerabilities is complicated, and how to use Pyup
Safety to make it easier. We’ll also explore some language myths and
best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
