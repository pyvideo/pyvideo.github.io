exclusively for desktop monitors capable of showing 1024x768 pixels,
sitting on the desk of a non-impaired, English-speaking person. But
today we need to embrace a much broader range of users. And one part of
this is designing sites for the visually impaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are automatic checkers that you can use to assess your site’s
accessibility. It will tell you that all your images need an alt tag,
and that the H2 should come after the H1. This is a good start, but even
if you dot all your i’s and cross all your t’s and get 100% pass, your
site may be an unnavigable mess in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will look at and &lt;em&gt;listen to&lt;/em&gt; real world examples of
websites that either pass or fail the accessibility test. We will hear
anecdotes from actual visually impaired users and discover how they
navigate the web. And we will see that even though frameworks like
Django can set us up for success, it’s up to us as developers to follow
through.&lt;/p&gt;
