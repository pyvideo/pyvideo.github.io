Stressful and tiring. What is it like to interview at 100 technology companies total in 4 months? I have done that. In August 2016, I quit a full-time software job to do job searching full-time. I did a job search where I talked to ~100 technology companies in the Bay Area to find the best fit. The hiring process reflects the company culture and its values. Listen to my rants and ruminations from going through various interviewing processes from tiny seed-stage startups to large technology companies in Silicon Valley. Hiring is still broken. Only a few companies do this well. Learn how to reform your own hiring process to be more considerate and thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine youâ€™re a new engineer at a workplace who has to learn a new unfamiliar codebase. After you acquire a copy of the repo, what is your next step? How do you dissect a new unfamiliar codebase to understand its inner workings? Come see a guided walkthrough of reading the widely used python-requests project, which gets over 18,000 downloads per day and powers many of the worldâ€™s REST-based APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

Brython
is an experimental Javascript library that enables you to leverage the
elegance of Python on the client side. Novice programmers who are
familiar with Javascript will learn about Brython, how Brython measures
up against Javascript, and why getting client-side Python adopted as a
mainstream tool is really difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
