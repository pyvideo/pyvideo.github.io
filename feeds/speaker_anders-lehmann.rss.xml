related pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pollution from personal transport in Cities is a big and growing problem.
By monitoring the flow, and congestion in the transport system two goals
can be achieved. First, the adherence to agreed limit values
(or breaking said limits) can be followed and used to decrease
health effects of local pollution hotspots. Secondly, monitoring
of the total emission of climate forcing gases from transportation,
is important for designing climate mitigation actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is used in combination with other tools to convert sensor data
from smartphones, into pollution concentrations in urban settings.
To mitigate the lack of complete data coverage, the missing data is
simulated by a traffic model, to locate congestion and model the
traffic related pollution concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
[Education Summit]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From september 2015 Aarhus School of Engineering will offer the
education Bachelor of Electronic Engineering, as a combined online
and on campus education. In the talk I will describe the technical and
pedagogical setup, we are working at to meet the challenges of having
both on-site and remote students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also touch on how IPython Notebook, will be part of the
technical setup, and how it can be incorporated into the teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

[EuroPython 2015]
[24 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will present some tools for working with Geographic
Information Systems in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographic information Systems are widely used for managing geographic
(map) data. As an example I will present how to use Open Street Map
data (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openstreetmap.org/"&gt;http://openstreetmap.org/&lt;/a&gt;), in routing, traffic planning and
estimation of pollution emission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of the project EcoSense (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ecosense.au.dk"&gt;http://ecosense.au.dk&lt;/a&gt;), GPS
data from users smartphones are mapped to OSM roads. The map matching
algorithm is written in Python and uses data from the database
PostgreSQL, with the PostGIS extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the goals of the EcoSense project is to devise methods to
improve the estimation of air quality in urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;
