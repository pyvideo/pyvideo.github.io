&lt;p&gt;Presented by Glyph Lefkowitz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks about using Python for everything in a project and the
difficulties of using different non-Python-based things in your

&lt;p&gt;Do you want it to be good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been lots of talks and posts and books about how to improve your project by adopting this or that tool or technology, by adopting a best practice.  We all want to improve.  We all want our code to be more correct. Faster. Friendlier. Easier to use. Better documented. Better tested. To have better coverage. Easier to contribute to. Easier to work on. More welcoming as a community. More repeatable. Less flaky. More secure. More sustainable. Easier to install. Easier to deploy. Easier to manage. Easier to discover. Easier to discuss, to report issues, to investigate issues, to triage issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we did all the things though?  How could we make our project perfect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will explore a comprehensive review of all of the best practices available to Python projects; a few specific to open source, but most applicable to just about anything written in Python.  In addition to learning about many, many best practices, their importance, and the tools available to facilitate them, I will also propose some solutions to the overwhelming sense of existential dread that one might feel when confronted with all of them at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is the biggest programming language in the world. According to the TIOBE index, it is more than 10% ahead of its closest competitor (C++). It is the 800 pound gorilla in the programming language world, used in some of the largest systems on the biggest networks in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all that success comes along with … overhead. In this talk I will discuss the ways that Python can scale back &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; to a smaller size along various axes, and the reasons why it needs to, if we want it to continue to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us who write that back-end code are typically sitting in front of desktop or laptop computers for 6-10 hours a day.  And yet, while we may want those machines to do certain tasks for us, for some reason it rarely occurs to many of us to use Python to solve problems on &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; computers rather than the ones in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll explore some of the capabilities that local computation can give you which cloud and web applications can't, and look at some of the ways that Python can help you leverage that power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python's flexible object model allows library and framework authors to
add very flexible declarations. Metaclasses, decorators, callable
objects, and operator overloading practically allow libraries to
re-define the language in order to provide a more concise, natural style
for that library. Unfortunately, the library user's first experience of
such conveniences is often confusing, because it's not clear what's
going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will try to convince you that all of this wonderful
magic isn't all that weird. This is not a typical how-to session on how
to use a particular feature, either of Python or of Twisted, but will
rather draw examples from Python, Twisted, and Zope to illustrate
techniques you can use to read and understand &amp;quot;magical&amp;quot; Python code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Twisted event-driven networking engine is well-known in the Python
community. However, only a few of its features are widely understood.
This talk will be a brief conceptual introduction to Twisted, followed
by a survey of its features, their status, and how development has been
proceeding over the years, with a special focus on the last two years of
sponsored development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will begin with a brief introduction to Twisted architectural
concepts; a description of the event loop, connections, and timers. It
will then segue into the many different features that Twisted offers,
including command-line tools for running an out-of-the-box
zero-configuration HTTP server, DNS server, IRC server, and SMTP server.
This will also present the relative maturity and stability of each of
these areas of the code, with a special emphasis on what level of
expertise a developer should have before attempting to use them.
Finally, I will describe some of the features that have been added to
Twisted along the way, including some new and exciting developments that
have been happening recently.&lt;/p&gt;

Complex, distributed systems fail in complex, distributed ways, and even
the simplest web app today is a complex distributed system. So, as our
code accrues little fixes to bugs that only show up in production, our
test suites eventually either become slow integration testing
monstrosities that are &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot; but flaky and unreliable, or useless
piles of mocks which are fast and deterministic but don't give you
confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll explore how to leverage event-driven programming, or
&amp;quot;async I/O&amp;quot;, to structure code in such a way that its tests are fast,
realistic, and reliable, even in the face of horrible race-conditions
you only discover in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, we will combine 4 Python-based technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jupyter is a real-time development environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twisted is a powerful platform for network programming that supports
many protocols, including HTTP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Klein …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will show students how to write applications and services
which efficiently publish and consume services and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Twisted is a powerful platform for network programming that supports

&lt;li&gt;Klein is a Twisted-based web application framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treq is a Requests-style HTTP client based on Twisted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining all of these we will guide students through &lt;em&gt;interactively
prototyping&lt;/em&gt; a production quality web application that &lt;em&gt;publishes&lt;/em&gt; both
&lt;em&gt;service APIs&lt;/em&gt; and web resources such as HTML, and that can &lt;em&gt;efficiently
consume many back-end services&lt;/em&gt; such as 3rd-party APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

managing secrets as well as Python-specific tips and tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

Those of us who write that sort of code are typically sitting in front of desktop or laptop computers for 6-10 hours a day. And yet, while we may want those machines to do certain tasks for us, for some reason it rarely occurs to many of us to use Python to solve problems on those computers rather than the ones in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's just because the APIs for controlling them are so different, and it seems difficult to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will explain how to use Python to integrate with your desktop environment; how to schedule tasks, schedule notifications, and script the applications you already use. We'll have a focus on macOS for demonstration purposes, but will also including pointers to similar tools for desktop Linux and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are the things we're doing with computers, overall, _actually_ great?
What is the _purpose_ of computers?  Why do we build software for them?  How
can we do it better?  And: should we be making anything other than video
games?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Glyph will answer those questions, and more; some of his
proposed answers might surprise you.  He will present extensive digressions
on the history of the craft and industry of software development, the impact
that recent events have had on the course of that history, and he will
contemplate new directions which might lead toward a brighter tomorrow.
Along the way, he will consider what lessons we might learn from the
progression of other, similar fields, such as medieval church architecture
and nuclear power generation.&lt;/p&gt;
