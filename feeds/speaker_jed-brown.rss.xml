(Single Program Multiple Data), catastrophically interacts with the
loading strategies of dynamically linked executables and
network-attached file systems on even moderately sized high performance
computing clusters. This difficulty is further exacerbated by
&amp;quot;function-shipped&amp;quot; I/O on modern supercomputer compute nodes, preventing
the deployment of simple solutions. In this talk, we introduce a
two-component solution: collfs, a set of low-level MPI-collective file
operations that can selectively shadow file system access in a library,
and walla, a set of Python import hooks for seamlessly enabling parallel
dynamic loading scalable to tens of thousands of cores.&lt;/p&gt;
