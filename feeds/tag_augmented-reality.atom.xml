2d-projection? plotVR is an open source package that provides a simple
way for data scientists to plot data, pick up a phone, get a real 3d
impression - either by VR or by AR - and use the computer's keyboard to
walk through the scatter plot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.github.com/thomann/plotVR"&gt;https://www.github.com/thomann/plotVR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing and plotting your dataframe open your phone's browser
and use your GoogleVR Cardboard. Furthermore performant Android- and
iOS-apps are available - both support VR-Cardboard and the iOS-Version
also AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are immersed in your Cardboard how do you navigate through the
scatter? plotVR lets you use the computer's keyboard to walk as you
would in any first person game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to share your impression? Just save the HTML and publish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technologies beneath this project are: a web server that handles the
communication between the DataScience-session and the phone, WebSockets
to quickly proxy the keyboard events, QR-codes facilitate the simple
pairing of both, and an HTML-Page on the computer to grab the keyboard
events. And the translation of these keyboard events into 3D terms is a
nice exercise in three.js, OpenGL, and SceneKit for HTML, Android, and
iOS resp.&lt;/p&gt;

musical instruments with new sonic possibilities offered by computers.
For doing so, we need ultra-low latency real-time audio processing
programs. Pretty much the typical situation where python should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be
used, right? Wrong. As it happens, that's exactly what we've been doing
for the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on Olivier Belanger's wonderful pyo module and (ab)using
python's flexibility, we developed custom software to allow us to
express our musical ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to hear how it sounds, you should go to Europython's social
event that will feature a gig based on python-augmented (!) instruments.
And if you want to know how we came to use python in this context and
how we do it, you should come to this talk!&lt;/p&gt;
