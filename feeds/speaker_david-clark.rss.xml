See &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://baypiggies.net"&gt;http://baypiggies.net&lt;/a&gt; for the latest talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
In this talk, I will discuss how I used Python to extract scientific information from a data cube. I used the astronomical instrument, NIFS (Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer), on the 8-m Gemini North telescope in Hawaii to acquire observations of the stunning, hourglass planetary nebula, HB 12. This instrument spreads light out into a spectrum over a small region of the sky. The output data is in the form of a data cube, with sky coordinates along the x and y directions and wavelength along the z direction. Spectra of planetary nebulae are important for understanding their structure and composition. I will discuss the Python scripts I used to analyze these data. Additionally, this talk will also cover the plotting library APLpy, which can be used to make publication quality figures.&lt;/p&gt;

The goal is to introduce the project and show how TensorFlow can be used online for real data tasks, and discuss other considerations for deployment of a TensorFlow project.
​
Abstract
TensorFlow is a deep learning library with Python and C++ bindings that was released in 2015. The talk start with a brief intro to TensorFlow, and then dive into the specific steps to set up a simple project that can be served online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;
Kendall is a lead software engineer at YesGraph, where he uses machine learning and Flask to power better invite flows for mobile and web apps. Previously he worked as an independent software consultant for four years, and before that he was a hardware designer at Qualcomm in San Diego for three years. Kendall was an an organizer of the San Diego Python Users Group, where he helped plan six one-day workshops on various Python topics.

Bio2
David Clark has a background in astrophysics, where he used Python extensively to analyze astronomical data. He recently transitioned careers to data science. Currently he is doing consulting for two startups. At Palo Alto Scientific, Inc., he uses the machine learning library TensorFlow to model sensor data from a wearable and infer a runner’s performance. He is also doing work for Quantea, Inc., making a dashboard using the Python libraries Bokeh and Pandas.&lt;/p&gt;
