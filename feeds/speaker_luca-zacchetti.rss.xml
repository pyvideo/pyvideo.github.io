Starting from a real world use case, I’ll explain why DRF became our
weapon of choice to develop in a fast and easy way all the APIs we need
at Cloud Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll start talking about the main benefits that DRF brings to Django
projects, then we’ll use our real world use case to describe the best
practices we use to build fast, secure and maintainable APIs diving into
DRF main features and functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of this talk is to explain in a very practical way how DRF can
be integrated into Django projects to build beautiful web APIs. We’ll
use a lot of code examples and performance benchmarks to describe the
various features explored during the talk. No prior experience on DRF is
required but at least some basic knowledge of Django is suggested for
attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
