&lt;p&gt;We are an engineer and a musician who were brought together by our
desire to give a voice to those underrepresented in the music industry.
We sought to give disabled individuals high quality music and technology
opportunities. Through the MyNormal project at Ark T Centre, we
developed workshops and Hackathons around building accessible
instruments. Inspired by Imogen Heap's mi.mu gloves, we use micro:bits,
Makey-Makeys, laptops, speakers, bananas, and cubes to empower
individuals to interact with music in ways they've never done before.
ScienceOxford is supporting the project, lending kit, equipment, and
machine time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project leaders are Hannah Bruce, Youth Music Project Manager at the Ark
T Centre and bassist of Death of the Maiden; Noelle Aly, Projects
Technology Officer and Maker at ScienceOxford.&lt;/p&gt;
