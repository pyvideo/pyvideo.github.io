&lt;p&gt;PSA: if you don't write tests, you'll instead write code for a time machine to go back &amp;amp; train a band of feisty raccoons to dump grape jelly on the head of your past self because you'll have realized she is a terrible, lazy, awful person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I didn't write tests.&lt;/p&gt;

It's for
people with curioisty to feed, anxiety to overcome, and worlds to
change. It's for people named Edna. (And others not named Edna.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this tutorial you'll be encouraged to &lt;strong&gt;bring your whole self to
learning&lt;/strong&gt;. We'll start with the very basics of Python, keeping your
fingers on the keyboard to gain as much practice as possible. Between
strings, functions, and other fun Python-y things, we'll discuss
learning deeply, nourishing our brains, and boosting happiness with
science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No prior experience required; come just as you are. This about being a
whole person. It's about learning Python, because Python is really cool.
It's also about staying afloat. Being productive. Focusing. It's about
finding joy in the error codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come play. It'll be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started my first Django project, I took the ‚ÄúSure, I think I can figure that out‚Äù approach, which is fun! And also dangerous. But exciting! And also horrible because I caused myself a lot of trouble and barfed on my keyboard. (Metaphorically.) Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope for this talk is to pass along lessons I learned the hard way, and save the world. Or at least prevent some frustration. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôll talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;version control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;structuring your project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and how to handle top secret stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôll also talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;throwing house parties without causing anaphylaxis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pregnant daddy seahorses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;velociraptors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promise all of that is related to Django.&lt;/p&gt;
