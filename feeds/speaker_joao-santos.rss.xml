&lt;dt&gt;Connexion is an open source API first REST framework for Python, built on top of Flask and based on Swagger, targeted for microservice development. Connexion automagically handles request routing, oauth2 security, request validation and response serialization based on a Swagger 2.0 Specification file in YAML, so you don’t have to care about boilerplate anymore. Because it is based on Flask it supports everything that Flask does, including deployment options and extensions.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;At Zalando we’ve adopted “API First” as one of our key engineering principles, to ensure our API are robust, consistent, general and abstracted from specific implementation and use cases. But when we tried to implement this principle for the first time we were faced with the lack of a python framework to achieve it in a easy fashion - there were several frameworks that produce a swagger definition from the implementation but none that do it the other way around - so we decided to fill that gap.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

[EuroPython 2015]
[21 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Software Engineer Joao Santos will describe how the
engineering team at Zalando has been migrating to local Git hooks to
ensure that engineers can work autonomously and flexibly. Zalando---
Europe’s leading online fashion platform for men, women and children--
began shifting from SVN to Git in late 2013. Santos and his colleagues
used Python to create a Git update hook that enabled the team to
reject changes to a branch while still allowing changes to other
branches. He’ll explain why his team chose Python for this job instead
of a bash script, point out mistakes made during the process (and
solutions his team used to fix them), and the benefits generated by
this migration. He’ll also talk about turnstile: a set of open-source,
configurable, optional local Git hooks, created by the Zalando team,
that enables engineers to abide by internal rules for committing code
while following their own coding style and workflow preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
