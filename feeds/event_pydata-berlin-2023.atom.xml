&lt;p&gt;Understanding time-series data is essential to handle automatically generated data, be it from server logs, IoT devices or any other continuous measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to handle the large amounts of incoming data from concrete mixing trucks, we evaluated a number of time-series databases as well as services to stream-process the data. For all of those decisions a key question was, of course, how well any of these tools integrate with our existing, all-Python backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right angle on time-series data will help you move tons of data with little engineering effort. In this talk, you'll learn from our practical experiences of choosing and implementing a time-series database in a Python context. You'll go away with a better understanding of how you can efficiently store, analyse and exploit streaming data.&lt;/p&gt;

With an average of 2000 representations per consultation and 4 rounds of consultation per Local Plan, the volume of information can be overwhelming for both LPAs and the Planning Inspectorate tasked with examining the legality and soundness of plans. In this study, we investigate the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline representation analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that LLMs have the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort required to analyse representations, with simulations on historical Local Plans projecting a reduction in processing time by over 30%, and experiments showing classification accuracy of up to 90%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we discuss our experimental process which used a distributed experimentation environment with Jupyter Lab and cloud resources to evaluate the performance of the BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and XLNet models. We also discuss the design and prototyping of web applications to support the aided processing of representations using Voilà, FastAPI, and React. Finally, we highlight successes and challenges encountered and suggest areas for future improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

A classical approach is to transform the database images and the query images into embeddings via a feature extractor (e.g., a CNN or a ViT), so that they can be compared via a distance metric. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can be used to train a feature extractor without the need for expensive and time-consuming labeled training data. We will use DINO's SSL method to build a feature extractor and Milvus, an open-source vector database built for evolutionary similarity search, to index image representation vectors for efficient retrieval. We will compare the SSL approach with supervised and pre-trained feature extractors.&lt;/p&gt;

There are myriads of interesting challenges that can be solved by data scientists.
However, collecting industrial data in general and industrial IoT (IIoT) data in particular, is cumbersome and not really appealing for anyone who just wants to work with data.
Apache StreamPipes addresses this pitfall and allows anyone to extract data from IIoT data sources without messing around with (old-fashioned) protocols. In addition, StreamPipes newly developed Python client now gives Pythonistas the ability to programmatically access and work with them in a Pythonic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide a basic introduction into the functionality of Apache StreamPipes itself, followed by a deeper discussion of the Python client. Finally, a live demo will show how IIoT data can be easily derived in Python and used directly for visualization and ML model training.&lt;/p&gt;

I present a Bayesian histogram anomaly detector (BHAD), where the number of bins is treated as an additional unknown model parameter with an assigned prior distribution. BHAD scales linearly with the sample size and enables a straightforward explanation of individual scores, which makes it very suitable for industrial applications when model interpretability is crucial. I study the predictive performance of the proposed BHAD algorithm with various SoA anomaly detection approaches using simulated data and also using popular benchmark datasets for outlier detection. The reported results indicate that BHAD has very competitive predictive accuracy
compared to other more complex and computationally more expensive algorithms, while being explainable and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

However, sharing Jupyter notebooks can be challenging, as they require installing a specific software environment to be viewed and executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JupyterLite is a Jupyter distribution that runs entirely in the web browser without any server components. A significant benefit of this approach is the ease of deployment. With JupyterLite, the only requirement to provide a live computing environment is a collection of static assets. In this talk, we will show how you can create such static website and deploy it to your users.&lt;/p&gt;

Its predictions are fully explainable on individual sample level, and yet Cyclic Boosting can deliver highly accurate and robust models. For this, it requires little hyperparameter tuning and minimal data pre-processing (including support for missing information and categorical variables of high cardinality), making it an ideal off-the-shelf method for structured, heterogeneous data sets. Furthermore, it is computationally inexpensive and fast, allowing for rapid improvement iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modeling process, especially the infamous but unavoidable feature engineering, is facilitated by automatic creation of an extensive set of visualizations for data dependencies and training results. In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the inner workings of Cyclic Boosting, along with a few sample use cases, and demonstrate the usage of the new Python library.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, while HPO improves the predictive performance of the final model, it comes with a significant cost both in terms of computational resources and waiting time.
This leads many practitioners to try to lower the cost of HPO by employing unreliable heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will provide simple and practical algorithms for users that want to train models
with almost-optimal predictive performance, while incurring in a significantly lower cost and waiting time. The presented algorithms are agnostic to the application and the model being trained so they can be useful in a wide range of scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide results from an extensive experimental activity on public benchmarks, including comparisons with well-known techniques like Bayesian Optimization (BO), ASHA, Successive Halving. We will describe in which scenarios the biggest gains are observed (up to 30x) and provide examples for how to use these algorithms in a real-world environment.&lt;/p&gt;

In a complex project, it can be tricky to identify the cause: Is it the data? A bug in the model? Choosing the wrong loss function at 3 am after an 8-hour coding session?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will build a toolbox to find the culprits in a structured manner. We will focus on simple ways to ensure a training loop is correct, generate synthetic training data to determine whether we have a model bug or problematic real-world data, and leverage pytest to safely refactor PyTorch models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this talk, visitors will be well equipped to take the right steps when a model is not learning, quickly identify the underlying reasons, and prevent bugs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ML researchers have developed new model-tuning techniques to address the known biases within existing models and improve their performance (as measured by response preference, truthfulness, toxicity, and result generalization). All of this at a fraction of the initial training cost. In this talk, we will explore these techniques, known as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and how open-source machine learning tools like PyTorch and Label Studio can be used to tune off-the-shelf models using direct human feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dask is a popular library for parallel and distributed computing in Python. Dask is commonly used in data science, actual science, data engineering, and machine learning to distribute workloads onto clusters of many hundreds of workers with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when things go wrong life can become difficult due to all of the moving parts. These parts include your code, other PyData libraries like NumPy/pandas, the machines you're running on, the network between them, storage, the cloud, and of course issues with Dask itself. It can be difficult to understand what is going on, especially when things seem slower than they should be or fail unexpectedly. Observability is the key to sanity and success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we describe the tools Dask offers to help you observe your distributed cluster, analyze performance, and monitor your cluster to react to unexpected changes quickly. We will dive into distributed logging, automated metrics, event-based monitoring, and root-causing problems with diagnostic tooling. Throughout the talk, we will leverage real-world use cases to show how these tools help to identify and solve problems for large-scale users in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk should be particularly insightful for Dask users, but the approaches to observing distributed systems should be relevant to anyone operating at scale in production.&lt;/p&gt;

In this light-hearted talk we will demystify the evolving revolution that will define the future of data analytics &amp;amp; engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our journey begins with the PyData Stack: pandas pipelines powering ETL workflows...clean code, tested code, data validation, perfect for in-memory workflows. As demand for self-serve analytics grows, new data sources bring more APIs to model, more code to maintain, DAG workflow orchestration tools, new nuances to capture (&amp;quot;the tax team defines revenue differently&amp;quot;), more dashboards, more not-quite-bugs (&amp;quot;but my number says this...&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data maturity journey is a well-trodden path with common pitfalls &amp;amp; opportunities. After dashboards comes predictive modelling (&amp;quot;what will happen&amp;quot;), prescriptive modelling (&amp;quot;what should we do?&amp;quot;), perhaps eventually automated decision making. Getting there is much easier with the advent of the Python Powered Modern Data Stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will cover the shift from ETL to ELT, the open-source Modern Data Stack tools you should know, with a focus on how dbt's new Python integration is changing how data pipelines are built, run, tested &amp;amp; maintained. By understanding the latest trends &amp;amp; buzzwords, attendees will gain a deeper insight into Python's role at the core of the future of data engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

The standard recommendation is to use vectorized functions implemented in Numpy, Pandas, or the like. However, what to do, when the processing task does not fit these libraries? Using plain Python for processing can result in lacking performance, in particular when handling large data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust is a modern, performance-oriented programming language that is already widely used by the Python community. Augmenting data processing steps with Rust can result in substantial speed ups. In this talk will present strategies of using Rust in a larger Python data processing pipeline with a particular focus on pragmatism and minimizing integration efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polars uses Rust and Apache Arrow to win in all kinds of performance-benchmarks and evolves fast. But is it already stable enough to migrate an existing Pandas' codebase? And does it meet the high-expectations on query language flexibility of long-time Pandas-lovers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will explain, how Polars can be that fast, and present my insights on where Polars shines and in which scenarios I stay with pandas (at least for now!)&lt;/p&gt;

These include factors like low latency prediction, the absence of vulnerabilities in dependencies and the need for the model behavior to stay reproducible for years. The longer the list of constraints, the longer it usually takes to take a model from its development environment into production.

Surprisingly these methods can be useful not only for computer vision – to model input data such as images or point clouds through global, robust properties – but in a wide range of applications, such as evaluating and improving the learning of embeddings, or the distribution of samples originating from generative models. This is the promise of the emerging field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) which we will introduce and review recent works at its intersection with machine learning. TDA can be seen as being part of the increasingly popular movement of Geometric Deep Learning which encourages us to go beyond seeing data only as vectors in Euclidean spaces and instead consider machine learning algorithms that encode other geometric priors. In the past couple of years TDA has started to take a step out of the academic bubble, to a large extent thanks to powerful Python libraries written as extensions to scikit-learn or PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt;

For providing high performance, many of the most complex DBMS components such as query optimizers or schedulers involve solving non-trivial problems. To tackle such problems, very recent work has outlined a new direction of so-called learned DBMSs where core parts of DBMSs are being replaced by machine learning (ML) models which has shown to provide significant performance benefits. However, a major drawback of the current approaches to enabling learned DBMS components is that they not only cause very high overhead for training an ML model to replace a DBMS component but that the overhead occurs repeatedly which renders these approaches far from practical. Hence, in this talk, I present my vision of Learned DBMS Components 2.0 to tackle these issues. First, I will introduce data-driven learning where the idea is to learn the data distribution over a complex relational schema. In contrast to workload-driven learning, no large workload has to be executed on the database to gather training data. While data-driven learning has many applications such as cardinality estimation or approximate query processing, many DBMS tasks such as physical cost estimation cannot be supported. I thus propose a second technique called zero-shot learning which is a general paradigm for learned DBMS components. Here, the idea is to train model&lt;/p&gt;

The good news: a synthetic version of this data does not need protection. Synthetic data copies the actual data's structure and statistical properties without recreating personally identifiable information. The bad news: It is difficult to create synthetic data for open-access use, without recreating the exact copy of actual data.
This talk will give hands-on insights into synthetic data creation and challenges along its lifecycle. We will learn how to create and evaluate synthetic data for any use case using the open-source package Synthetic Data Vault. We will find answers to why it takes so long to synthesize the huge amount of data dormant in public administration. The talk addresses owners who want to create access to their private data as well as analysts looking to use synthetic data. After this session, listeners will know which steps to take to generate synthetic data for multi-purpose use and its limitations for real-world analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, use cases and requirements of data applications have evolved: Today, every application, from web services that run in application servers, interactive environments such as notebooks and IDEs, to phones and edge devices such as smart home devices, want to leverage the power of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Spark's driver architecture is monolithic, running client applications on top of a scheduler, optimizer and analyzer. This architecture makes it hard to address these new requirements: there is no built-in capability to remotely connect to a Spark cluster from languages other than SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spark Connect introduces a decoupled client-server architecture for Apache Spark that allows remote connectivity to Spark clusters using the DataFrame API and unresolved logical plans as the protocol. The separation between client and server allows Spark and its open ecosystem to be leveraged from everywhere. It can be embedded in modern data applications, in IDEs, Notebooks and programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk highlights how simple it is to connect to Spark using Spark Connect from any data applications or IDEs. We will do a deep dive into the architecture of Spark Connect and give an outlook of how the community can participate in the extension of Spark Connect for new programming languages and frameworks - to bring the power of Spark everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if it's that easy, because nearly all pretrained models have a very annoying limitation: they can only process short input sequences. Not every NLP practitioner happens to work on tweets, but instead many of us have to deal with longer input sequences. What started as a minor design choice for BERT, got cemented by the research community over the years and now turns out to be my biggest headache: the 512 tokens limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll ask a lot of dumb questions and get an equal number of unsatisfying answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much text actually fits into 512 tokens? Spoiler: not enough to solve my use case, and I bet a lot of your use cases, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can feed a sequence of any length into an RNN, why do transformers even have a limit? We'll look into the architecture in more detail to understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody smart must have thought about this sequence length issue before, or not? Prepare yourself for a rant about benchmarks in NLP research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we do to handle longer input sequences? Enjoy my collection of mediocre workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, an alternative approach towards it, quasi-experimental frameworks, is discussed. Additionally, I will present how to adjust well-known machine-learning algorithms so they can be used to quantify causal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

At scieneers, we wanted to test those components to satisfy our own information needs using a slack-bot that will answer our questions by reading through our internal documents and slack-conversations. We therefore leveraged the HayStack QA-Framework in combination with a Weaviate vector database and many fine-tuned NLP-models.
This talk will give you insights in both, the technical challenges we faced and the organizational learnings we took.&lt;/p&gt;

Get GPU-class performance on your commodity CPUs with compound sparsity and sparsity-aware inference execution.
This talk will demonstrate the power of compound sparsity for model compression and inference speedup for NLP and CV domains, with a special focus on the recently popular Large Language Models. The combination of structured + unstructured pruning (to 90%+ sparsity), quantization, and knowledge distillation can be used to create models that run an order of magnitude faster than their dense counterparts, without a noticeable drop in accuracy. The session participants will learn the theory behind compound sparsity, state-of-the-art techniques, and how to apply it in practice using the Neural Magic platform.&lt;/p&gt;

When software is written in a way that is plugin friendly, it encourages the use of modular organization where the contracts between the core software and the plugin have been well thought out. In this talk, we cover exactly how to define this contract and how you can start designing your software to be more plugin friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the talk we will be creating our own plugin friendly application using the pluggy library to show these design principles in action. At the end of the talk, I also cover a real-life case study of how the package manager conda is currently making its 10 year old code more plugin friendly to illustrate how to retrofit an existing project.&lt;/p&gt;
