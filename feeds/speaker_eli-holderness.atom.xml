&lt;p&gt;No C knowledge required!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is a wonderful thing that takes all the complication of memory management away from us. We don’t have to worry about pre-allocating memory for our objects, or remember to free it once we’re done. So, given that we’re not doing it manually, how do these things happen? Do we have to care? Well, sometimes. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll discuss what a pointer is, where they crop up in Python, and what you need to know in order to avoid getting tripped up by them. We’ll also cover the &lt;cite&gt;id&lt;/cite&gt; of an object, how it varies between different implementations like IronPython and PyPy, and why &lt;cite&gt;is&lt;/cite&gt; is different from &lt;cite&gt;==&lt;/cite&gt;. Finally, we’ll talk about garbage collection, what reference counting is, and how CPython knows when it’s time to get rid of unused objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you just want to understand what’s going on under the hood without having to dive into the implementation, or you’re on the hunt for some new diabolical things to do with code (self-referential lists are only the beginning!), come along to this talk and learn about the pointers in your Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at anyone with an interest in how Python handles objects in memory, or who’s ever been confused by side-effects popping up in their code. Absolutely no knowledge of C is required, and Python beginners are extremely welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m just going to say it: I’m Bad at working from home. That’s a problem, because I’ve been doing it for the last year, it looks like we might have more than a little while to go yet before office life resumes, and my ADHD isn’t exactly going anywhere in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even aside from the myriad ways that remote working can expose issues in a company’s management or communications infrastructure, there are a whole host of problems that can arise on a personal level. In this talk, I discuss some of the ones I’ve grappled with over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can’t stay focused? End up endlessly doomscrolling, or procrastinating for hours before really starting to work for the day? Trouble sleeping, or zoning out during the day with nobody around to keep you on track? If that sounds familiar, stop by and maybe get some ideas of things you can do about it - or at least feel less alone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded at the 2021 Python Web Conference (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2021.pythonwebconf.com"&gt;https://2021.pythonwebconf.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

But now people expect an alphabet soup of SSO, 2FA, OAuth, OIDC, SAML, FIDO2, OTP… What do they all mean - and why do they matter? Why is central authentication useful? What does two-factor authentication really protect us from, and what’s still wide open? Learn how to keep your users safe as we discuss the good, the bad and the ugly of modern authentication mechanisms for the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll cover what authentication is, common ways of doing it, and common pitfalls. We’ll also cover what makes a web authentication system good, and whether that’s distinct from whether it’s secure (spoiler alert: it is!). Attendees will come away with a sense of what the authentication landscape looks like for modern web apps and why, and a few weird industry factoids to share at dinner parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at anyone passingly familiar with web development, with an interest in security, or who simply wants to know what’s really going on when you ‘sign in with Google.’
#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
