software testers has always been that of 'Cat and Mouse'. This
relationship has had its fair share of short comings which chiefly
included unmet deadlines and lack of confidence when shipping
software products. The talk is meant to introduce a better
relationship between developers and testers by going over the
importance of including testing in an Agile cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will look at different levels of testing E.g. Unit vs integration
testing, how units work together. Knowing why we are writing each test -
what are we trying to achieve when we write a test for a unit as that is
a place that developers struggle and either write duplicate tests or not
enough and changeability and confidence can suffer as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective is to build better agile software teams and ship clean python
projects with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
