In addition to these domain specific libraries we also maintain a suite of infrastructure packages. This infrastructure can be easily utilized to cover the needs of most scientific Python projects. Sharing the tools we developed for maintenance, testing, documenting, and general upkeep of the most essential parts of our project maximizes the impact of the software engineering expertise and resources within the whole ecosystem to ensure that others can benefit from the efforts of the core Astropy team.&lt;/p&gt;

Its Data Analysis Tools are written almost entirely in Python. I will provide an overview of these tools, and describe some of the technical aspects of how they leverage and contribute to the wider Python scientific ecosystem. I will also describe some of the unusual sociological and organizational elements of this effort that arise from the 3-way collaboration between academic scientists, NASA funded engineers/developers, and the Open Source Astropy project.&lt;/p&gt;

absence of shared efforts in the field. While there are well known, free
software tools available for astronomy, most have been developed by
large institutions, and the past few decades have seen comparatively
little progress in fostering a community-based set of software tools.
There is hope that is changing now. The continuing growth of Python in
astronomy has led to an increasing awareness of needless duplication of
efforts within the community and the need to make existing packages work
better with each other; such discussions came to a head on the astropy
email list in the spring of 2011 leading to formation of the astropy
project. The first coordination meeting was held in the fall of 2011,
and significant progress has been made in setting up a community
repository of core astronomical packages. We will describe the general
goals of astropy and the progress that has been made to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astropy is a community-based software project to coordinate the
development of libraries and applications for astronomy. We will report
on progress that has been made with astropy since the last scipy
conference. The past year has seen much growth in the number and quality
of the core libraries in astropy and a public release. We will highlight
the new capabilities available, and outline the development plans for
the upcoming year. Finally we discuss the strategies for advertising its
capabilities and growing the documentation and tutorials available for
users and developers.&lt;/p&gt;
