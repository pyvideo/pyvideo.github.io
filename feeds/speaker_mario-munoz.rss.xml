With powerful tools at my fingertips and plenty of ideas, they needed to find a place to land. A web framework, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bombarded my search engine with variations of &amp;quot;which Python framework should I use.&amp;quot; This led me to several &amp;quot;batteries included&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;microframework&amp;quot; comparisons, with varying degrees of usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will highlight some reasons I ultimately decided to build my blog, [Python By Night](&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.pythonbynight.com"&gt;https://www.pythonbynight.com&lt;/a&gt;), on the backbone of FastAPI, and where I am today on my Python journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that hypermedia has been making a quiet resurgence in the web development landscape. One of the most popular toolkits in the Python space is htmx, offering a simple, declarative approach to AJAX and Server Sent Events directly from your HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this trend is taking shape in the Python ecosystem as a whole, Django goes even further, providing a maturing set of patterns, tooling, and projects that take full advantage of these new (old?) paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are some of the ways that Django is leading the charge in making hypertext cool again? What are some examples of projects already utilizing these tools? Is this a viable approach to _serious_ web design? And what are some of the ways that we could improve the adoption of hypermedia within Django, and Python as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;

She even notices that some flies, moths, or beetles look more like bees than she does. Her perspective changes when she bumps into another unlikely bee named Xyla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our journey as developers sometimes follows a similar pattern. We may question what it means to be a developer in the first place and we're not quite sure how we fit in. On the other end, when we grow to be more experienced, we may inadvertently (or sometimes consciously) make it more difficult for others to _belong_.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the role of community in an individual's sense of identity, and what are some of the ways that we try to come to terms with our place within the developer landscape? Let's find out... together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that hypermedia has been making a quiet resurgence in the web development landscape. One of the most popular toolkits in the Python space is htmx, offering a simple, declarative approach to AJAX, CSS Transitions, and Server Sent Events directly from your HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, tools like TailwindCSS are making it easier to design your application simply by adding preconfigured CSS classes to your HTML elements. There's no need to meddle around with a CSS file or fear that completely changing your design will increase bloat or introduce clashing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now build a beautiful and responsive application with nothing more than Python and HTML!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at some of the tools that exist to enable the PyHAT (Python htmx ASGI Tailwind) stack and discuss where we can go from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why distinct communities exist within the software space, some good, some bad, some _natural_. For example, &amp;quot;baby duck syndrome&amp;quot;denotes a situation where a computer user &amp;quot;imprints&amp;quot; on the first system they learn. This can lead to identifying within the context of that community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the Python space, we can see small and large communities converging around a certain package or framework. These communities can be vibrant, supportive, and generally wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest ways in which we can &amp;quot;build bridges&amp;quot; from these communities in order to learn from each other, promote diversity, and break down barriers. This will not only benefit those of us within these communities, but also newcomers looking to find their footing.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello, Functional FastAPI Web App!</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2022/goodbye-hello-world-hello-functional-fastapi-web-app.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a web application with Python is super easy. With just a few lines of code, you can get a simple, working app running directly on your computer's browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome! But then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial focuses on that awkward transition from beginner to intermediateâ€”when you want a project to be less of a sketchpad and more of an actual, useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will learn tactics on how to find and use resources when devising a plan for your web application, as well as hands-on learning for tackling common (and necessary) aspects of building your app, such as configuration, app structure, and database modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the training, you will be following along as we build the foundation of a fully-functional web application, and will leave with the ability to further refine it for real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

Is it enough
just pinning your dependencies in a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/tt&gt; file? Or is
there any reason to learn one (or any) in a myriad of dependency
management tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It depends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Untangling the complexity of this topic &lt;em&gt;might not&lt;/em&gt; be worth it for
certain small projects. But there are a lot of reasons why learning
about (and using) a dependency management tool will help you in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out why embracing proper dependency management can help your
project's predictability, sustainability, security, and yes, even
simplicity. Learn how you can use a tool like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pdm&lt;/tt&gt; to help accomplish
these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
