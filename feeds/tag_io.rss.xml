&lt;p&gt;Presented by Donovan Preston&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network servers which scale to thousands of simultaneous connections
have always been possible in Python thanks to libraries such as asyncore
and twisted. More recently, FriendFeed's new open source project Tornado
has stirred debate in this area. These libraries allow a Python process
to scale to many simultaneous connections using non-blocking I/O (also
known as asynchronous I/O). However these projects require that the
programmer learn a custom API to abstract away the complexities of using
a callback-style API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventlet uses greenlet, which provides coroutines as described in &amp;quot;The
Art of Computer Programming&amp;quot;, to implement efficient cooperative
concurrency while retaining synchronous semantics. Eventlet also
provides an implementation of the standard library's socket module. Code
written to use Python's standard socket library can be transparently
converted to use nonblocking I/O and green threads with eventlet. This
leads to much greater code reuse and programmer efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by David Beazley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most Python programmers know, Python 3 breaks backwards compatibility
with Python 2 in a number of significant ways. Although guides to Python
3 tend to focus on superficial incompatibilities such as the new print
function, changes to exception handling, or new language features, the
most substantial changes concern the strict separation of Unicode and
bytes as well as the new I/O stack. Not only do these changes have
far-reaching effects throughout the standard library, but changes to I/O
are likely to be the most major source of problems for anyone porting an
existing Python application to Python 3. In this tutorial, we're going
to take a top-to-bottom tour of the entire Python 3 I/O system. We'll
focus on how to properly handle both text and binary data, changes to
standard library modules, examine advanced features such as the buffer
API, perform some performance experiments, and end with practical advice
for programmers working on porting applications from Python 2 to 3.
Intended Audience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermediate to advanced Python programmers who are either developing
new applications or contemplating a migration to Python 3. Attendees
should already be familiar with the basics of Python programming
including standard datatypes and commonly used library modules. A
background in systems programming topics such as file handling,
subprocesses, and socket programming is also recommended. Class Outline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing Python 3 (with a focus on I/O)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text Processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary Data Handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with System Interfaces and External Programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The New io library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The revised buffer API and direct I/O&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Porting from Python 2 to 3.&lt;/li&gt;
