Such students have the potential to connect data science to its societal context in a sophisticated way. For educators working with such students to support this potential, it is essential to 1) welcome newcomers and center student perspectives and 2) consistently and authentically connect technical content with societal context. We present a framework for teaching Python based introductory data science skills in a highly contextualized and domain flexible environment, based on our experience teaching introductory data science to law and diplomacy students.&lt;/p&gt;

We will showcase components of the SToPA library which use Python tools such as web drivers, optical character recognition, geospatial mapping, machine learning and statistical sampling to better understand the policing landscape. The goal of this work is to present an easily replicable framework for analyzing police and community interactions with accessible on-ramps for activists, developers and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
