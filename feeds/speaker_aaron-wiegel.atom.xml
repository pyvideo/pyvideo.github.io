In addition, processing data at scale is challenge since enterprise laboratory information management systems (LIMS) typically rely on transactional, row-oriented databases that are not designed to handle millions of records at a time. However, with clever use of pandas for unusually formatted files or pyspark (via Databricks) for large numbers of records, this data can be processed into cleaner, more useful forms for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
