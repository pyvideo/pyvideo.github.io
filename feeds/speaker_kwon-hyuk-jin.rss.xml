This leaves data analysts with a dilemma: whether to downsample the data and lose information, or to scale out the data workload using a distributed processing framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PySpark is one of the representative distributed processing tools for such cases. However, to use it, data analysts have to learn a new PySpark from scratch. To solve this problem, Apache Spark provides the pandas API. Existing pandas users can simply replace the pandas package with pyspark.pandas to distribute their existing workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can write your own user-defined functions (UDFs) that are not included in the existing PySpark API. Pandas Function APIs, introduced in Spark 3.0, allow users to apply arbitrary Python native functions to PySpark dataframes and process their inputs and outputs as pandas instances. This allows data analysts to train ML models based on each group of data using the pandas functions they already use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will cover how to perform distributed processing from the perspectives of the above two pandas users and PySpark users.&lt;/p&gt;
