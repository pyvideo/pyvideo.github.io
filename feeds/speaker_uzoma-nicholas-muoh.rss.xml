analytics, machine learning, and web apps but python is a workhorse that
plays a tremendous and often invisible role in our day-to-day lives,
from medicine to finance, and even the transportation of goods from
manufacturers to the shelves of our neighborhood stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportation networks are highly dynamic, goods are always moving from
point A to point B and money every minute is being gained or lost.
Improving efficiency in a transportation network is critical to the
survival of a business that provides transportation and distribution
services as well as ensuring timely delivery of goods to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk examines 3 real-world examples of how Python is used to
improve the efficiency of transportation networks, particularly we will
explore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding the optimal match between a driver and a load at the lowest
possible cost using google's &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ortools&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating recommendations for macro level optimizations to a
transportation network using &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;networkX&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping the descision making process by answering the question
&amp;quot;Should I accept this work?&amp;quot; using &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;skfuzzy&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graph analytics and data science concepts that facilitate getting
goods from manufacturers to stores more efficiently and at a lower
cost to businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An appreciation of the complexity of the logistics industry and the
role Python plays in making the life of drivers better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
