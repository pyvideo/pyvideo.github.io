time-consuming, and often reactive. But what if we could automate part
of that process using satellite imagery and Python?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll walk through a real-world project that combines
transfer learning, PyTorch, and publicly available datasets to classify
road segment conditions (good, fair, poor) from aerial imagery. You'll
learn how to work with messy real-world geospatial data, fine-tune a
deep learning model using only a small training set (~2,000 examples),
and overcome common challenges like blurry imagery, inconsistent labels,
and overfitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session is practical and code-driven, aimed at data scientists and
analysts working in mobility analytics, urban development, or
infrastructure who want to apply machine perception techniques in their
work. By the end, you’ll walk away with a reusable workflow for
analyzing and predicting urban infrastructure quality — all using free
tools and open data.&lt;/p&gt;
