Using the free, open source, CVE Binary Tool vulnerability scanner (written in python!), we'll show what it looks like to set up vulnerability scanning, what kinds of fun things you find, and how keeping things up to date can mean an ongoing maintenance burden that is more like a free puppy than a free beer. We'll talk about how naive policies, governmental mandates and capitalism may ruin your day, and what we can do to stay secure and help everyone get past the puppy phase without sending anyone back to the pound.&lt;/p&gt;

language has its own sets of tools and edge cases that are worth
knowing. Python is one of many popular languages that is rarely the
focus in security training, but that doesn't mean python code is
automatically secure (no matter what the internet tells you). Learn why
people who say “pylint will help you with security” aren’t doing you any
favours, how to use Bandit for security-focused linting and talk about
other options for static analysis. Take a deeper look at why scanning
for publicly known vulnerabilities is complicated, and how to use Pyup
Safety to make it easier. We’ll also explore some language myths and
best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

Customizing and designing patterns takes a lot of math to get sizing and shapes right, but not all knitters love math, and even those who do don't want to do it by hand all the time. Every year at PyCon I meet a few more knitters, so I thought maybe this was the year we could put our heads together and build an open source knitting toolkit and maybe make customizing your knitting a little easier for everyone. The pyKnit toolkit will hopefully make it easier for people to adjust garment patterns to fit, for pattern designers to be size inclusive, or for any knitter to adjust patterns to make the most out of a special ball of yarn.&lt;/p&gt;
