&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll tell why GraphQL has been created, what problems does it solve and how to create GraphQL APIs with Python with an additional follow up on how to use it with Django, one of the most popular web framework. If we have enough time I‚Äôll touch on advanced topics like authentication, caching, security and real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaway: the objective of the talk is to have an introduction on GraphQL, understand why and when to use it and, finally, how to use it Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience: the talk is for web developers with some experience building web APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will learn some basics of Domain Driven Design and how to apply the pattern when using Django and GraphQL. We will see different approaches of modelling the domain, and discuss the tradeoffs. We will discuss why this approach makes a lot of sense with GraphQL and finally we will see a complex approach where we leverage the domain driven architecture to have an easy way to abstract how we store and cache our data in order to build a performant GraphQL API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at people with knowledge of web-development. GraphQL knowledge won‚Äôt be necessary as I‚Äôll do a quick introduction of that. Experience with Django, Flask or similar framework might be useful but not required.
The audience will learn basic concepts of domain driven design and how to apply them to build a scalable GraphQL API.&lt;/p&gt;

GraphQL and what kind of issue you might encounter writing GraphQL APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the talk you‚Äôll know what GraphQL is, how to implement a
basic GraphQL API using Python and what to look out for when working
with GraphQL in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target audience: python developers with familiarities of web APIs (like
REST). some knowledge of type hints might be useful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;API performance is crucial for delivering a smooth and responsive user
experience. GraphQL has gained popularity as a flexible and efficient query
language, but without proper optimization, it may underperform or even become a
bottleneck in your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll dive into the essential techniques and best practices to
optimize GraphQL performance, ensuring that your APIs are snappy, scalable, and
resource-efficient. Attendees will learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The importance of batching queries and how to implement it using DataLoader or
similar libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of query complexity and depth, and how to set up limits to prevent
resource abuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leveraging persisted queries to reduce network overhead and improve caching
capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing caching strategies, both on the server and client-side, to
minimize redundant requests and reduce load times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploring monitoring and observability tools that can help you identify
performance bottlenecks and continuously optimize your GraphQL implementation
for maximum efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
