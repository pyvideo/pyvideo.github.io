applications that target Windows, Mac, Linux, mobile, and embedded
platforms. PyQt (and PySide) provides python bindings for the Qt
library, and allows one to quickly and easily build GUI applications in
pure Python. While web-based and mobile development gets all the
attention these days, there are still many use-cases for which native
apps are much more suitable. Qt provides an extremely rich and
well-designed set of classes to build complex user interfaces both
visually (with Qt Designer) and programmatically, and PyQt makes
building native apps incredibly fast and easy. This tutorial will
introduce the main ideas and modules in Qt and how the bindings work,
and demonstrate building an application from scratch with PyQt.&lt;/p&gt;
