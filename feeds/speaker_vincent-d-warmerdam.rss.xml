Warmerdam - PySpark and Warcraft Data
[EuroPython 2015]
[21 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will describe how to use Apache Spark (PySpark) with
some data from the World of Warcraft API from an iPython notebook.
Spark is interesting because it speeds up iterative processes on your
hadoop cluster as well as your local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will give basic benchmarks (comparing it to numpy/pandas/scikit),
explain the architecture/performance behind the technology and will
give a live demo on how I used Spark to analyse an interesting
dataset. I'll explain why you might want to use Spark and I'll also go
in and explain when you don't want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset I will be using is a 22Gb json blob containing auction
house data from all world of warcraft servers over a period of time.
The goal of the analysis will be to determine when and if basic
economics still applies in a massively online game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will assume that the everyone knows what the ipython notebook is and
I will assume a basic knowledge of numpy/pandas but nothing fancy. The
dataset has been chosen such that people who are less interested in
Spark can still enjoy the analysis part of the talk. If you know very
little about data science but if you love video games then you should
like this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

Warmerdam - The Joy of Simulation: for Fun and Profit
[EuroPython 2016]
[19 July 2016]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/the-joy-of-simulation-for-fun-and-profit"&gt;https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/the-joy-of-simulation-for-fun-and-profit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk discusses some joyful exercises in simulation. I'll
demonstrate it's usefulness but moreover I'll discuss the sheer joy.
I'll discuss how to generate song lyrics, I'll discuss how to get
better at casino games, how to avoid math, how to play monopoly or
even how to invest in lego minifigures. No maths required; just a
random number generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk discusses some joyful exercises in simulation. I'll
demonstrate it's usefulness but moreover I'll discuss the sheer joy
you can experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll go over the following points (the short list):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll show how you can avoid math by simulating; I'll calculate the probability that two people in the live room have the same birthday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll show how simulation can help you get better at many games. I'll start with simple card games and with the game of roulette. Most prominently I'll discuss how to determine the value of buying an asset in the game of monopoly (See blogpost: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://koaning.io/monopoly-simulations.html"&gt;http://koaning.io/monopoly-simulations.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll demonstrate how you can simulate Red Hot Chilli Pepper lyrics. Or any other band. Or legalese.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll demonstrate the results of a scraping exercise which helped me to determine the value of investing in Lego Minifigures (See blogpost: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://koaning.io/lego-minifigs-stochastics-profit.html"&gt;http://koaning.io/lego-minifigs-stochastics-profit.html&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the level of the audience I might also discuss how biased
simulation can help you solve optimisation problems or even introduce
bayesian statistics via sampling. I'll gladly leave this decision to
the EuroPython committee.&lt;/p&gt;

loosing. So he wanted to train a bot to play on his behalf. This is our
story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re using AWS Lambda to get better at a card game named SushiGO. We
make a small genetic algorithm in Python that uses AWS Lambda as a
backend. The talk consists of these parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick Explanation of the rules of the SushiGo Card Game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translation of real life to an algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain why this problem needs a lot of CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain why AWS Lambda fits the simulation use-case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to quickly hack Concurrency in Python&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to deploy lambda very quickly with chalice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimentation Results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss an algorithm that we’ve tried to improve in three
ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying simple maths to make the search algorithm better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throwing lots (lots!) of CPU’s against the problem by leveraging AWS
Lambda and python concurrency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will conclude by discussing whether or not AWS Lambda is suitable for
a gridsearch/grid simulation (hint, it’s not meant for this task, but it
actually kind of works very well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a technical talk where I'll explain the inner workings of the machine learning algorithms inside of Rasa. In particular I'll talk about why the transformer has become a part in many of our algorithms and has replaced RNNs. These include use-cases in natural language processing but also in dialogue handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll see a live demo of a typical error that an LSTM would make but a transformer wouldn't. The algorithms are explained with calm diagrams and very little maths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will give many examples of when Bayes rule will help you in your day to day work. I'll quickly show many examples of bayesian statistical thinking in action; the pleasure of inference, probabilistic graphs, model selection, feature generation, even operations research! I'll finish with a dataset from Heroes of the Storm and I'll show why Bayesian models can outperform randomforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk is made up of the following examples;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;basic disease example: what is the value of adding an extra test to a patient
give an example of an inference task that is very hard to do properly without bayesian thinking
creating simple probibalistic models with pandas and showing how they are robust against missing data. I will also demo pomegranate, a new probabilistic programming tool for python.

Warmerdam</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:pyvideo.org,2014-07-26:/pydata-berlin-2014/visualising-data-through-pandas.html</guid><category>PyData Berlin 2014</category></item><item><title>TNaaS - Tech Names as a Service</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pydata-berlin-2017/tnaas-tech-names-as-a-service.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will explain how I built a service that generates Pokemon names. You'd be surprised how hard it is to do this properly and how easy it is to do it practically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TNaaS - Tech Names as a Service Deploying a Random Generator that's Phonetically Pokemon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a striking phonetic similarity between big data technology and pokemon names. This has caused some hilarious conversations with recruiters on linkedin: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentwarmerdam/"&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentwarmerdam/&lt;/a&gt; but it also made me wonder. Can I create a service that generates strings that sound like potential pokemon names and what might be the simplest possible way to make that into a service? Also, would it be possible to generate pokemon names that start with three random characters and end with 'base' (KREBASE, MONBASE would be appropriate but IEYBASE would not be).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that this is an interesting problem from a ML standpoint and that it is rediculously easy to build in the cloud. In my talk I will explain the ML behind it;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;markov chains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;probibalistic graphs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rnn/lstm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bidirectional lstm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk I will also do a deep dive on the pros and cons of these methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently have a 101 version of the service live here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dyccxmwpz9.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pokemon/poke-names/v2"&gt;https://dyccxmwpz9.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pokemon/poke-names/v2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time of the conference it will have a proper front end and I have already bought the domain name of tnaas.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've talked about a similar topic in the past: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/TkHT3sLwtkY?t=22m10s"&gt;https://youtu.be/TkHT3sLwtkY?t=22m10s&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of this talk is to spend more time explaining how I actually built the service; both from a coding perspective as well as a deployment perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if there are any questions. I am submitting multiple talks that I think are interesting and relevant to the PyData crowd, I'll gladly leave it to the committee which (or if any) of them are relevant to the local community.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk I will explain the idea of sampling to get to your model and I will demonstrate it with examples. The goal is to start with a for loop and to end with understanding how MCMC algorithms work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
A lot of people understand the scikit-learn models of todays world but feel uneasy about the whole MCMC method of training. Why are these algorithms different? How is it that you don't use a gradient method but a sampler instead? It can feel a bit misterious if you've not properly been introduced to this other way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will explain the idea of sampling to get to your model and I will demonstrate it with examples. The goal is to start with a for loop and to end with understanding how MCMC algorithms work. As a consequence the audience will also get a proper introduction to PyMC3. In particular I will discuss the following;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why markov chain sampling can be equivalent to direct sampling
how to build your own MCMC sampler with a for loop
how this for loop can be run faster by using PyMC3 instead
the key idea of inference and how i was briefly able apply it in a santa kaggle competition
how to analyse timeseries with MCMC in PyMC3
Parts of this talk are readily available on my blog;&lt;/p&gt;

Linear models work. No need for deep learning or
complex ensembles, you can often keep it simple. In this talk I'll
discuss and demonstrate some winning tricks that you can apply on
simple, even linear models.&lt;/p&gt;

One might even call it common sense. The problem is that machine learning models don't typically have that and the results can be disastrous. This talk is about celebrating constraints on models in order to improve their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
