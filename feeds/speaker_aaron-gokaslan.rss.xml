These models leverage extensive text data to achieve advanced linguistic capabilities. However, the trend towards proprietary tools and closed large language models is growing, posing unique challenges in open-source AI development. This discussion will explore the intricacies of training such models, the hurdles in dataset management, and the regulation of open-source contributions. We'll explore how to effectively iterate on collected data, prepare for extensive training sessions, and coordinate research across large open-source organizations. We will discuss the challenges of generative models in three different modalities: text, image, and genomics. The talk will draw from the speaker’s personal experience on working on OpenWebText, OpenGPT2, BLOOM, CommonCanvas, Caduceus, and other generative models. We will also cover the changing AI environment and how the future of open souce is threatened by onerous regulation, ever increasing compute costs, and the commoditization of previously open data.&lt;/p&gt;
