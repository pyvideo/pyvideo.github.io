&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is getting worse across the world, but how does an
individual know how to reduce their exposure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be presenting my project that is focused on personalised air
quality monitoring. The battery-powered device measures air pollution,
as well as a series of other environmental variables. The data is then
transmitted wirelessly to my Home Assistant instance. This allows a user
to monitor, visualise and ultimately predict their daily exposure to
pollutants. In addition the Home Assistant integration makes it simple
to trigger actions based on their data. For example, flash a light in a
userâ€™s home or send them a notification, if the pollutant concentration
rises. All that you need to make your own is a low cost micro-controller
and a few readily available components.&lt;/p&gt;
