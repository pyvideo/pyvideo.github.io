because of their lossy approach to reduce the required bandwidth. This
affects commercial streaming services such as Netflix, or Amazon Prime
Video, but affects also video conferencing and video surveillance
systems. In all these cases it is possible to improve the video quality,
both for human view and for automatic video analysis, without changing
the compression pipeline, through a post-processing that eliminates the
visual artefacts created by the compression algorithms. In this
presentation we show how deep convolutional neural networks implemented
in Python using TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn and Scipy can be used to reduce
compression artefacts and reconstruct missing high frequency details
that were eliminated by the compression algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;In particular, we follow an approach based on Generative Adversarial
Networks, that in the scientific literature have obtained extremely
high quality results in image enhancement tasks. However, to obtain
these results, typically, large generators are employed, resulting in
high computational costs and processing time, and thus the method can
be implemented using GPUs usually available only on desktop machines.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;In this presentation we show also an architecture that can be used to
reduce the computational cost and that can be implemented also on
mobile devices.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A possible application is to improve video conferencing, or live
streaming. Since in these cases there is no original uncompressed video
stream available, we report results using no-reference video quality
metric showing high naturalness and quality even for efficient networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video compression algorithms used to stream videos are lossy, and when
compression rates increase they result in strong degradation of visual
quality. We show how deep neural networks can eliminate compression
artefacts and restore lost details.&lt;/p&gt;
