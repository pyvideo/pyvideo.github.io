Even seemingly banal information like your commuting patterns, purchasing habits or insurance reimbursements, can tell a nuanced story of who you are and how you can be influenced. This causes a headache for the honest data scientist who is interested in big picture analytics, not spy-stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there has been a huge movement over the past 10-15 years to create a new type of tech stack founded on the concept of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), which act as brokers of trust between data sources and data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will give an overview of how we have been building (and today launching) a new python framework, which integrates directly with Jupyter via a backend extension, to make using PETs trivial in the day to day functions of a data scientist. We call it Antigranular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect this project to be a long term endeavour and if you are interested in privacy, confidentiality, security and, of course, data science we would encourage you to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
