As a Django dev you cannot ignore Javascript frameworks anymore. But integrating React (or any javascript framework) with Django is not seamless: thereâ€™s no documented guide to setup a project, getting hot reloading to work is a painful must-have, and then how do you even leverage the power of both frameworks to code faster? Doing this without losing time and productivity is very hard.
After 4 years of building a dozen django/react projects at Theodo, I want to share with you the very efficient setup we came up with, both for development and production use.&lt;/p&gt;
