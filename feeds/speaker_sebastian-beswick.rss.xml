&lt;p&gt;An understanding of the fundamentals of computer sound is essential for
the well-rounded IT professional. Audio is a field that is teeming with
jargon, but it doesn’t have to be so scary! In this session we’ll go
back to basics and take a look at the core components of sound,
including how we (as humans) perceive sounds, and how we can represent
them within a computer. By the end of this session, you'll know enough
to go home and create your own simple synthesiser!&lt;/p&gt;
