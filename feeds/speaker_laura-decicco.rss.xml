At that time, the perception within the USGS was the use of R was exclusive to an elite group of &amp;quot;very serious scientists.&amp;quot; Fast forward, we now find many newer USGS hires having a solid grasp of the language from the start along with the use of R in a wide variety of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll discuss my experiences maintaining the dataRetrieval package, how it's shaped my career, impacted USGS R usage, and why data providers should consider sponsoring their own R packages wrapping their data API services.&lt;/p&gt;
