of coordinated activites by a team. Early in the MER mission the author
automated in Python much of the task of one of the operation positions,
the Payload Uplink Lead, for 7 of the 9 cameras on each rover. This talk
describes the MER rovers, the operation tasks and that implemented
system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mars Exploration Rovers (MER), Spirit and Opportunity, have been
roaming the surface of Mars since January of 2004 leading to many
discoveries about the nature and history of our sister planet. Each
activity requires a complex set of coordinated activites by a team.
Early in the MER mission the author automated much of the task of one of
the positions, the Payload Uplink Lead, for 7 of the 9 cameras on each
rover. The system, called AutoPUL, is written in Python and that has
proven to be the excellent choice for the development and maintenance.
In the talk I'll describe the Mars Rover mission and the operational
activities and how AutoPUL and Python fullfilled those needs.&lt;/p&gt;
