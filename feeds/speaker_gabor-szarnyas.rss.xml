relationship: Common systems such as Postgres or Spark are hard to set
up and maintain, hard to transfer data into and out of, and hard to
integrate into Python workflows. In response, data scientists have
developed their own data wrangling tools including Pandas and Polars.
These tools are more natural to use, but are limited in the amount of
data they can process and the amount of automatic optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuckDB is a novel database management system purpose-built to combine
cutting edge data processing and dataframe-like ease of use. DuckDB
integrates deeply with the Python data analytics and engineering
ecosystems - its Python client has over 1.5 million downloads each
month. DuckDB can read and write popular Python dataframe libraries:
Pandas, Polars, and Apache Arrow. DuckDB can even query Pandas
dataframes faster than Pandas itself. Beyond dataframes, reading and
writing is supported for Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite databases, and
across many file formats (even on cloud object storage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the friendliest SQL dialect in the world, DuckDB provides
options for using Pythonic dataframe syntax directly on top of the
database engine. DuckDB includes a relational API, an experimental
PySpark-compatible API, and is the default engine for the Ibis portable
dataframe library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuckDB supports complex queries, is MIT licensed, and has no external
dependencies - it is a single pip install away! It is fast, easy to
install and use, and handles larger than RAM datasets. Since DuckDB runs
in the same process as the Python interpreter, no socket communication
has to occur, making data transfer virtually instantaneous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our talk, we will describe DuckDB, compare it with Python dataframe
libraries, and show how to combine DuckDB and dataframes for fast and
easy data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
