An overview on machine learning models for human mobility</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-italia-2017/where-are-you-going-an-overview-on-machine-learning-models-for-human-mobility.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent explosion of big mobility data, such as massive traces from
GPS devices and mobile phone networks, opened the door to the study of
the quantitative spatio-temporal patterns characterizing human mobility.
In this talk we will first introduce the audience in the world of human
mobility and related challenges. Then, we will briefly show how to deal
in Python with geo- mobility dataset and finally, we will go trough the
recent advances in machine learning and deep learning in the context
human mobility (e.g. prediction of the next visited place).&lt;/p&gt;
