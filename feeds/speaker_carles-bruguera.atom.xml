[EuroPython 2015]
[22 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I told you that we’ve built an open source “WhatsApp”-like
RESTful API on the top of Pyramid? We've developed MAX: a real-time
messaging service and activity stream that has become the key feature
for a social intranet at the BarcelonaTech University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will show how we designed and built MAX with performance in mind
using state of the art Python technologies like Gevent, WSGI, and
multi-threaded queue processing. We will also show you how we've
managed to design a simple architecture guaranteeing both high
scalability and performance, achieving connecting ratios over 30.000
students, teachers, and university staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API is secured using oAuth 2.0 resource owner password credentials
flow powered by our own oAuth server implementation (Osiris) also
Pyramid-based. We are using MongoDB as general storage backend and
RabbitMQ over websockets to support realtime and messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
