It might solve non-complex or well-defined standard problems. This presentation is a demystification of years of experience and painful mistakes using Python as a core to create reliable data pipelines and manage insanely amount of valuable data. Let's cover how each piece fits into this puzzle: data acquisition, ingestion, transformation, storage, workflow management and serving. Also, we'll walk through best practices and possible issues. We'll cover PySpark vs Dask and Pandas, Airflow, and Apache Arrow as a new approach.&lt;/p&gt;
