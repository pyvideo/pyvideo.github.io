&lt;p&gt;Description
Innovations in machine learning are changing our perception of what is possible to do with a computer. But how will machine learning change the way we program, the tools we use, and the mix of tasks done by expert programmers, novice programmers, and non-programmers? This talk examines some possible futures.&lt;/p&gt;
