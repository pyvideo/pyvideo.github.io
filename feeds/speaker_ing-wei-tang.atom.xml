modern operating system. Since Android is also a linux-based operating
system, with some techniques, it is also possible for us to write a
script. Unfortunately before SL4A arrives (Scripting Language 4
Android), it is not possible for us to script on Android phone. SL4A
provides rich APIs that allow user to access Android intents such as GPS
location, Accelerometer, Camera, Battery status, and etc. through
scripting. Hence with the rich APIs, the user can build a very simple
script to interact with those APIs, without building a complex app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talks shows how we can interact with android intents and APIs via
RPC using python client embedded inside the android app, through SL4A
app. First the speaker introduces various python related apps available
for android OS. Next the speaker will show the relationship and
interaction between Android API and Python API inside SL4A, and how RPC
is used as communication between two APIs, hence demonstrate how a new
different service/intent can be built based on the provided Android API,
by doing some hacking on Python API inside SL4A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker will begin his talk with introduction on the basic of RPC,
and illustrate the relationship between Android APIs and Python APIs in
SL4A, by comparing both Android and Python code. The speaker will then
demonstrate how different android intents can be accessed on the android
devices, through various demo, such as reading GPS coordinate and x, y,
z position from the accelerometer, together with making a phone call
through python client on android phone. In the end, the speaker will
demonstrate how a flask application that allows user to send SMS
messages through Rest APIs, can be built on top on the android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SQL client is ubiquitous and impossible for developers not to have one in their toolbag. However potentially there is a unforeseen situation that the developers are forbid to use SQL client to access the cloud/on-premise SQL DB. This proposal primarily addresses the issue of such scenario and provides a solution based on the hacker's mindset. In this proposal, the author will show how he tackles this pain point in his workplace, by creating a universal SQL client CLI that allows him to connect to the SQL DB in his DB cluster, hence extends this project to other SQL DB using the API standardization in PEP 249. Apart from integrating all the SQL connectors, the author also implemented standardize hotkey for all the SQL DB, by studying the internal core of the SQL standards, and retrieving SQL metadata using pure SQL queries through the hotkeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyMetheus is a project that the author started in order to monitor Raspberry PI units at home after the author found out that one of the RPis experiences intermittent failure. Although Prometheus can be a better choice in monitoring, however some RPis suffer crashing after installing the Prometheus' exporters. Hence the author started to learn about the Prometheus' architecture and began mimicking a Python based server-client monitoring system that can be installed on RPi zero, together with Grafana dashboard to display the monitoring data. Apart from that the author also integrates email and sms/phone notification system using external mail API and QPython on Android when there is an alert triggered in the monitoring system. The author is also looking in implementating PyMetheus as alternative for IoT system monitoring. The author likes to take the opportunity to share his experience in crafting and implementing the monitoring system using embedded SOC system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Motivation
The purpose of the talk is to demonstate how the author can design a monitoring system using small and portable embedded system with limited RAM such as Raspberry PI to monitor his home-made RPIs based data-centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Architecture
The client
The client uses requests and posts the monitoring data to PyMetheus server via REST API. The client can also be crafted using urequests in MicroPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server
The server consists of several components namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregator
The Aggregator is responsible to collect and aggregate the data collected from clients via REST API, using flask framework. The Aggregator stores the data into the database, including the monitoring events from the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database
The Database is responsible to store the data collected from the client. The default database used in current version are sqlite3 and postgressql. The Database can be used as integration with the notification, reporting, as well as other third party applications via PyMetheus Open API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notification
The current alert notification is integrated with external email API. The author also includes the Android integration system that the author had crafted previously using Qpython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporting
Grafana will be the current reporting dashboard but the author will be designing a new dashboard in coming version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modular - You choose what to monitor
PyMetheus comes with some basic monitoring packages for monitoring, however it contains a base class that the user can design their own monitoring system, by overriding the class based on their requirements easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-party Integration
Since PyMetheus contains Open API, therefore it allows the user to build their application using the PyMetheus Open API. Apart from that the user can also crafts their own monitoring system on the client side using the base class modular that the author builds.&lt;/p&gt;
