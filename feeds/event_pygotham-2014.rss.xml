That makes for a lot of data. This
talk will walk you through how you can use MongoDB to store and analyze
worldwide weather data from the entire 20th century in a graphical
application. You'll learn how to ask and answer questions about capacity
planning and scaling for both real-time and ad-hoc operations when
dealing with huge datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

his work without sounding critical, he had others whose remarks were
merciless and direct — to the point that Tolkien simply stopped sharing
new chapters as he wrote The Lord of the Rings. As programmers we share
many of the struggles of writers and artists, and we often react just as
badly to critique of our code. From Tolkien’s experience we will draw
lessons about how to make critique generous instead of damaging, and
actionable instead of personal.&lt;/p&gt;

years ago with a gnarly bug and some bad assumptions. A few long nights
and a lot of reading later, the docs corrected my assumption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The
truth of x==y does not imply that x!=y is false. Mind == blown and mind
!= blown. In Getting Rich with Comparison Methods we'll start by
learning how to avoid common and costly bugs in your rich comparison
methods, learn a bit about which methods are executed in comparisons and
why, and then go beyond symmetrical comparisons exploring some of the
ways we can take full advantage of asymmetrical comparison methods.&lt;/p&gt;

The industry

fight this horrible problem. Come learn about the work I've done so far

of the tools I've made and used in python. I will be covering web
scraping, text processing, and image processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be taking folks through a number of web scraping tools that I use
to find instances of human trafficking. We will then go through
classification algorithms I use to determine genuine instances of
trafficking. Finally I will discuss image processing and facial

It
is the fundamental package for scientific and statistical computing in
Python. MongoDB’s scale, speed, and flexibility make it ideal for
storing large amounts of data. However, the official MongoDB driver is
not optimized for loading MongoDB documents into NumPy arrays. Enter
“Monary”, which allows you to easily examine and manipulate data using
NumPy arrays. We will explore how Monary can accelerate your scientific
analysis while providing you with the scale and flexibility of MongoDB
and the ease of Python.&lt;/p&gt;

examples of where PyParallel shines in comparison to the existing

programming language for analyzing, and playing with, natural language.
(It’s not the only one, but especially for people just diving in to
using a programming language for language play or research, it’s great.)
Rather than going into details of algorithms, I'm going to give some
simple, easy-to-build-upon examples of how Python and open source Python
packages can be used to quickly dive into some really awesome aspects of
research/investigation in linguistics, and bring them together to
explain, at a high level, why I believe Python is an excellent bridge
between linguists interested in programming, beginning programmers
interested in linguistics, and any curious people who like figuring
stuff out about languages all along a spectrum of formality.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk is specifically about how Python based analytics can be
integrated operationally into an organization at two levels: in ad hoc
investigations and in production analytic services. This is about best
practices in documented, reproducible and archived data investigations
as well as production development with Python. A case study of an
analytic service for cheating detection in Call of Duty Ghosts will make
this real and provide some fun. This talk is rated PG-13 for some
awesome video game violence.&lt;/p&gt;

naturally scale to more data than can fit in memory. PySpark is the
Python API for Apache Spark that is designed to scale to huge amounts of
data but lacks the natural expressiveness of Pandas. We will introduce
Sparkling Pandas, a new library that brings together the best features
of Pandas and PySpark; Expressiveness, speed, and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

Classic
timeseries applications include site traffic, service health, and user
engagement monitoring; these are increasingly complemented by a range of
products and features that surface aggregated timeseries data directly
to end users. Services that power such features need to be resilient
enough to ensure a consistent user experience, flexible enough to
accommodate a rapidly changing product roadmap, and able to scale to
tens of billions of events per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience has shown that truly robust real-time aggregation services
are hard to build; scaling and evolving them gracefully is even harder;
and, moreover, many timeseries applications call for essentially the
same architecture, with slight variations in the data model. Solving
this broad class of problems at Twitter has been a multiyear effort. In
previous talks we have introduced Summingbird, a high-level abstraction
library for generalized distributed computation, which provides an
elegant descriptive framework for complex aggregation problems. In this
talk, I will describe how we built a flexible, reusable, end-to-end
service architecture on top of Summingbird, called TSAR (the TimeSeries
AggregatoR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TSAR uses Python to provide an service toolkit that integrates with
essential services that provide data processing, data warehousing, query
capability, observability, and alerting, automatically configuring and
orchestrating its components.&lt;/p&gt;

with failure. In this talk we'll cover a number of approaches and tools
to help you build systems that deal with failure as gracefully as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;

libraries for doing data visualization, but most everyone defaults to
always using the same library for all their pictures. This talk will
give an overview of the philosophies underpinning matplotlib, chaco,
bokeh, vispy, vincent, and d3py and discuss what sort of applications
each library is best suited for.&lt;/p&gt;

parallelize development, and scale high traffic apps. One of the
downsides of service oriented web applications, however, is managing the
high overhead of communication between services, and handling the
additional complexities that come along with service driven development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, Randall Degges, Stormpath Developer Evangelist and
OpenCNAM co-founder, will share all of the best practices he learned
while building OpenCNAM, supporting billions of API requests.&lt;/p&gt;

modules), writing tests with Unittest, and debugging with pdb. This
tutorial will also include a section on the extra features of IPython.&lt;/p&gt;

rigorous world of mathematics and the pragmatic world of engineering. As
evidence of its immaturity as a discipline, consider how frequently the
same problems arise in the practice of writing a programme, and how
these problems are unaccompanied by widely-disseminated
conceptualisations or a commonly agreed-upon pathology or even a
well-defined guiding philosophy and epistemology. In other words, we
keep running into the same problems, and we often lack even a basis for
discussing them (much less avoiding them)!&lt;/p&gt;

remember the community with a fondness that likely doesn't accurately
reflect the former reality. We'll explore how we can take a set of
articles from an online community and winnow out the stuff we feel is
unworthy. We'll explore some of the machine learning tools that are just
a &amp;quot;pip install&amp;quot; away, such as scikit-learn and nltk.&lt;/p&gt;
