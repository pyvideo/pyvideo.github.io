These methods and techniques play an important role in the design and understanding of robots, vehicles, spacecraft, manufacturing machines, human motion, etc. In particular, the attendees will develop code to simulate the motion of a human balancing while standing. This is an advanced tutorial and domain specific but we have found that a broad audience enjoys the topic. Attendees should be familiar with the basics of the SciPy stack, in particular NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, and IPython and have some familiarity with classical mechanics. Details In this tutorial, attendees will learn how to derive, simulate, and visualize the motion of a multibody dynamic system with Python tools. The tutorial will demonstrate an advanced symbolic and numeric pipeline for a typical multibody simulation problem. By the end, the attendees will have developed code to simulate the uncontrolled and controlled motion of a human balancing while standing. We will highlight the derivation of realistic models of motion with the SymPy Mechanics package. Then we will cover code generation to create fast numerical functions that can be used to simulate the system. The simulation results will be plotted and visualized with a 3D WebGL browser based tool. Finally, we will use packages for optimal control to develop a controller that mimics human standing and visualize these results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will highlight the derivation of realistic models of motion with the
SymPy Mechanics package. We will walk through the derivation of the
equations of motion of a multibody system (i.e. the model or the plant),
simulating and visualizing the free motion of the system, and finally we
will addfeedback controllers to control the plants that we derive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is best if the attendees have some background with calculus-based
college level physics. They should also be familiar with the SciPy
Stack, in particular IPython, SymPy, NumPy, and SciPy. Our goal is that
attendees will come away with the ability to model basic multibody
systems, simulate and visualize the motion, and apply feedback
controllers all in a Python framework.&lt;/p&gt;

It aims to
become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the
code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily
extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any
external libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we will introduce attendees to SymPy. We will show
basics of constructing and manipulating mathematical expressions in
SymPy, the most common issues and differences from other computer
algebra systems, and how to deal with them. In the last part of this
tutorial we will show how to solve some practical problems with SymPy.
This will include showing how to interface SymPy with popular numeric
libraries like NumPy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This knowledge should be enough for attendees to start using SymPy for
solving mathematical problems and hacking SymPy's internals (though
hacking core modules may require additional expertise).&lt;/p&gt;
