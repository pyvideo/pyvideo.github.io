Even art and creativity, fields that are by many considered as distinctly human, have not been left unaffected. While many either fear that AI will replace or substitute humans, or argue that an AI can never be creative and that anything generated by AI is by definition not art, I want to present an alternative view. I believe that advanced AI will allow us humans to focus on what makes us truly human, and provide us with new tools for creative exploration. I will present NeuralFunk, an experiment in using deep learning for sound design. NeuralFunk is an experimental track entirely made from samples that were synthesized by neural networks. It is not music made by AI, but music made using AI as a tool for exploring new ways of creative expression.&lt;/p&gt;
