We will subsequently have a look at what those vulnerabilities can cause and how you can get “hacked”. We will also discuss how developer and security teams struggle to talk in a common language to prevent and mitigate those vulnerabilities. Lastly, we will see how you can prevent and mitigate them in real-life.&lt;/p&gt;
