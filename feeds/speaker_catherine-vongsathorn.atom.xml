talks. It turns out that many of python's core principles apply very
well to presentations -- or for that matter, communication more
generally -- which may be why we like python so much. Xan and Catherine
want to get people excited not only about giving talks but also about
using them to &lt;em&gt;actually communicate&lt;/em&gt;. You donâ€™t have to be an expert,
nor do you need natural talent, to give a good talk; this metatalk will
discuss guiding principles that set effective presentations apart and
can be applied to any technical talk.&lt;/p&gt;
