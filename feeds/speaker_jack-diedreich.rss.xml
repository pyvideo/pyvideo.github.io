I've written and reviewed lots of functions and the same advice comes up again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your function should have three parts: input, transform, and output. You should do them in order and not intermingle the three.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the function readable by giving your reader context and keeping the amount of implied context low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can mostly ignore cargo cult practices like one-entry-one-exit and strict function length limits. We'll talk about why those cults exist and how to defend against them in a code review.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
