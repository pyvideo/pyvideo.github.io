&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Bath has begun the process of introducing programming in Python to
the undergraduate curriculum. During this time, I have been a PhD
student, first- year undergraduate tutor and laboratory demonstrator in
the Department and have been closely involved in the development of this
course as well as its teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I pioneered the use of Python programming and the Jupyter
notebook interface to enhance my tutorials. This has involved preparing
the answers to each tutorial question in a formatted notebook that is
assessable to the students during and after the tutorial. Furthermore,
using the notebook in the tutorial, during teaching, enables immediate
feedback and helps students that do not typically interface with
programming to see its utility directly to their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I have developed pylj, a Python code written to facilitate
student interaction with computational chemistry (an area important to
chemical research but often underappreciated at the undergraduate
level). This software operates in a Jupyter notebook interface and
allows students to perform atomistic simulation to probe topics from
physical chemistry that are covered in their lecture material. The fact
that the students are now familiar with Python means that it is easy for
inquisitive students to interact with and hack the underlying code.&lt;/p&gt;
