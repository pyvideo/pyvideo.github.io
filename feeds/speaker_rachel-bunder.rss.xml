I'll be giving advice on how to avoid these speed bumps along with how to work with OpenStreetMaps in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

Python is an easy language to learn. Many Python programmers just picked it up thinking “It can’t be too different from X, just with indents!”. By learning a language this way you don’t discover the features unique to that language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we’ll take a tour of Python features that are easily missed. This includes list comprehension,  generator functions and the PEP documents. Where appropriate time comparisons between different methods will be given.&lt;/p&gt;
