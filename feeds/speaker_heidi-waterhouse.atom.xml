&lt;p&gt;This talk digs in to how optimizing for search and using the existing technical assistance forums can put your product ahead of the pack. Technical writing, in all its variations, is a type of interface with your product. It incorporates everything from an error message to an implementation guide. How can you as a developer make deploying, using, and promoting your product as painless as possible? Make it searchable. Make finding the answer to a problem so trivially easy that your user barely even remembers they had a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one wants to be using software. They want to be data mining or manipulating beautiful photos or targeting advertising. Making them think about the software diverts them from what they want to be accomplishing. Use these documentation techniques to get them in and out and on their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't code. But I do study the methods languages use to think about themselves. Python has an iterative garbage collection that moves things into increasingly &amp;quot;old&amp;quot;/irrelevant buckets, until they are re-used or deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we applied that to more than just code? What if we expanded it to my old foe, wiki pages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me for an engaging exploration of what code can teach us about documentation and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;

We talk a lot about minimum viable products, and building our products up from small features. We talk a lot about failure, and how to learn from it and not replicate failures over and over again. But what I haven’t heard a lot of discussion about is how we know we’ve succeeded. Is it market share? Usable product? Could understanding and setting a measurable, achievable goals help us overcome imposter syndrome, second sock syndrome, and feature creep?
This talk provides some metrics on identifying success, documenting what it will look like when you get there, preserving the idea, and dealing with the inevitable distractions and changes in direction that may prevent you from ending up where you expect.
I plan to speak on how documentation can serve a crucial function at both defining and driving success. We need to stop believing that agile is the end of the answer and embrace it as part of building what we want to have in the end.
Continuous improvement can have a victory condition, if we build it.&lt;/p&gt;
