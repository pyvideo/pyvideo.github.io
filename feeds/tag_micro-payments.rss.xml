Micropayments for IoT</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-au-2016/402-payment-required-micropayments-for-iot.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if you could provide access to sensor data in exchange for small amounts of payment, or give your devices a stipend and they could autonomously engage in commerce with in a marketplace of machines? Payment solutions for microresources thus far have either required cumbersome aggregation, billing and centeralised metering or have been deemed too cheap to meter. We'll explore technology that could reduce this friction such as the bitcoin blockchain and open source python libraries that allow your devices to engage in micropayments in a fast, trustless and cheap manner.&lt;/p&gt;
