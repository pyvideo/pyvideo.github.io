We will provide examples of these packages and highlight the benefits of using the ETS.
Enthought is also working on a new Pythonic, toolkit-independent, declarative DSL to build GUIs called Enaml. We will take a sneak peek at some of Enaml’s features.&lt;/p&gt;

Margherita &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Enthought Tool Suite (ETS) is a collection of Python-based open
source components that form a foundation for nearly every application
that we deliver to our customers. In this talk I'll demonstrate how to
use ETS to rapidly develop an example scientific software application.
We'll concentrate particularly on introducing Traits, Traits UI, and the
Chaco and Mayavi visualisation tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prerequisites: some previous experience of working with Python and NumPy
/ SciPy is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dr. Ilan Schnell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation gives an overview of how packages are build and
distributed for different operating systems in the Enthought Python
Distribution. Enstaller (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Enstaller/4.0.0"&gt;http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Enstaller/4.0.0&lt;/a&gt;) is
a tool I wrote for installing egg-based packages, which are not
necessarily Python packages, such as SWIG or HDF5. I will discuss the
architecture of Enstaller, and in particular the egg-based distribution
format.&lt;/p&gt;
