&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes has taken the world by storm, changing the way we think about server usage and application deployments. There are many deployments of Salt around the world where it's being used to set up, manage, communicate with and maintain Kubernetes clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll look at the different Salt components that make interacting with Kubernetes extremely smooth! We'll look at ways to easily install and maintain Kubernetes clusters. We'll also look at ways we can utilize Salt to control and deploy out applications to a Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll look at ways to bring events from the cluster such as when containers are created or destroyed into the Salt event bus and what we can do with those events once they're available.&lt;/p&gt;
