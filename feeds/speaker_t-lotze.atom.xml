&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;zc.buildout is a tool to install and configure applications. An
application may consist of multiple parts and include multiple programs
and processes. Both installation and configuration of the application as
a whole are controlled by a configuration file which makes it possible
to reproduce them exactly at a later point in time or on a different
host. zc.buildout is extensible so it may be used to install application
parts with nearly arbitrary individual requirements. The talk introduces
zc.buildout, gives an overview of its possibilities as well as the major
third-party extensions and demonstrates the system by means of a case
study.&lt;/p&gt;
