&lt;p&gt;Calling Java APIs from CPython is one of the more interesting challenges
facing developers who want to get Python working as a first-class
language for developing apps for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk looks at solutions, past and present, for making the world of
Java accessible from Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop looking at me like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No really. Stop it. I'm serious. Why are you looking so confused?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. I'm talking about Java at a Python conference. What of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, well, I'm actually talking about avoiding having to code in Java,
when circumstances almost certainly require you to code in Java… or at
least require your applications to run in a Java environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting challenges for Python developers targetting
Android is being able to call Java APIs from CPython. Environments like
Android require developers to use Java to get access to Android's user
interface libraries. Perhaps more importantly, Android has APIs for
accessing hardware features like accelerometers and geolocation, and
software features like notifications, but all of these have a Java
interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk looks at how these problems have been solved, and where they
haven't, approaches to solutions that might exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Which is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing optional static typing in Python will bring with it some
benefits that other languages have had for years: IDEs will be able to
do code completion better; a whole class of boring tests will fall out
automatically; and some bugs will be easier to catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is also undeniably a huge change of direction: will it mean you
have to substantially change your code style? Will Python's simple
expressiveness suddenly become unattainable thanks to clumsy Java-style
type declarations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show how PEP 484's Gradual Typing system works, we're going to look
at TypeScript, a minimal implementation of Gradual Typing over
JavaScript. We'll see how the type system works, and how it fits into
the already thriving JavaScript developer community, where most people
aren't using type hints at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll draw some parallels with how Python's implementation will work,
and see what Python can learn from a language that has successfully made
the jump to a type-hinted world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often I hear people lamenting that Python has too many features and that older versions of Python were better for that exact reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make those people happy, we're going to pick apart the features of Python that enable the &lt;cite&gt;async&lt;/cite&gt;/&lt;cite&gt;await&lt;/cite&gt; syntax, layer by layer, until we happen upon a working implementation of coroutines that will function in Python 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Python's a great language for solving the sort of problems that are
posed in Mobile development time -- speedy development cycles, 20 years
worth of libraries for solving many tasks that you throw at it, and a
ready-made community to help developers. So why aren't we using Python?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk surveys the current landscape of Python on the major Mobile
platforms, and ways you can start targeting Mobile platforms with your
Python code. We'll look at considerations for Mobile web development,
the state of Python-based mobile toolkits, and progress towards
Python-coded native UIs.&lt;/p&gt;

code is written.” — Tim Ottinger, author of ‘Clean Code’, on Twitter
[1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated testing is one of the most important tools in the modern
programming toolbox: good tests help you find regressions early, and
help you make sure your code is right before it ships. Test-driven
development is a great way to make sure your software is up to
specification before you start work. Even better, it makes sure your
software’s architecture is amenable to writing tests from day 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens when you find yourself working on code where automated
testing took a back seat to being shipped? Chances are you’ll have a sea
of bugs, strung together in a structure where writing simple unit tests
just isn’t going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken code is a support burden, and if it’s in production, you’ve got
no choice but to make things work. Luckily, automated testing isn’t a
lost cause here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll look at how to approach automated testing on
late-stage, or even production code… or in any situation when you don’t
have the luxury of starting with a test-driven structure. We’ll look at
techniques that I’ve used to analyse faults in existing code, and how to
translate those into tests, and how to use that to fix bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, we’ll look at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tooling and metrics to help you decide what code to test, and how to
measure progress when you’re writing tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approaches to constructing test cases for old code, including using
data-driven approaches, and approaches based on requirements
specifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Granularity — making tests on old code granular enough is difficult,
so we’ll look at the trade-offs between unit and integration tests on
old code, and ways to make integration-level tests granular enough to
make results reliable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see that testing old code is both achievable, and actually a
worthwhile exercise. You’ll find bugs. You’ll increase quality. You’ll
make your code more maintainable! Do try it!&lt;/p&gt;

When you’re a big, for-profit project, it can be easy to justify a change from outdated software to the new hotness: figure out why the old software isn’t working for you, do a cost-benefit analysis, and – if it still seems like a good idea – make the change.
When you’re a community of volunteers, that justification can be less clear: cost-benefit analyses will rarely be about money. Worse still, the human costs can be difficult to justify: It’s difficult to get volunteers to do more unpaid work than they’re already doing. If your community depends on Open Source software, you get the added political difficulty of needing to navigate the divide between large-scale change and making small improvements to systems your community actively contributes to.
Whilst the motivation might be different, the process isn’t: leading a community towards change means understanding why existing systems aren’t suitable, making your community enthusiastic about the need for change, and then actually making that change.
To help make this point more concretely, we’ll look at how and why linux.conf.au – a long-running Open Source conference in Australia – effected a move away away from a bespoke legacy conference management software to one based on Symposion, the popular Django-based software created for the Python Software Foundation. We’ll also look at how that’s led to the PSF funding Registrasion, a Django-based conference sales platform.
With this case study as a guide, we’ll talk about how to make a decision to replace the software that your community runs on. In particular, we’ll cover how to identify and engage with stakeholders within a community; the value of prototypes in maintaining interest; and what a cost-benefit analysis might look like when your currencies are human joy, and burnout prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

Python 3 promised to improve a lot of inconsistency and difficulty in the language, and pave the way for performance improvements and new language features. It also broke backwards compatibility with Python 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, Python 3 was a difficult language to adopt: bad porting advice meant that transitioning from Python 2 to Python 3 was difficult. Many key Python libraries also took an awfully long time to be ported to Python 3, which kept projects that depended upon them stuck using Python 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, however, Python 3 has finally reached the point where it’s the language that you should be using. Big projects like Django have made the switch and are now stable, which means it’s not only possible, but actually a good idea to start writing new code in Python 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll look at some early missteps in the transition process for Python 3 — we’ll look at language changes that got in the way of making porting to Python 3 an easy process. We’ll look at why the original advice for how to adopt Python 3 was bad, and what the correct way to adopt Python 3 now looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also look at the last 8 years of language features that have been added to Python 3, many of which make writing asynchronous code super-easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python 3 is new, shiny, and ready for you to use. Come and learn why now is the time to make the switch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the move to Django allowed linux.conf.au 2017 to pick existing apps that were a best fit for our conference’s needs, and let us focus on building up bespoke apps for the few remaining tasks that hadn’t been solved yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at how the move went for linux.conf.au 2017, what went wrong, what went well, and how moving to Django helped us make a conference website that was easier for team members to contribute to, and solved long-standing problems that we couldn’t solve before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also look at the open source projects that we’ve launched and adopted, and show you where you can contribute to making next year’s PyCon AU website even better, or how to use our suite to help run your own conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2020.pycon.org.au/program/VVNEZR"&gt;https://2020.pycon.org.au/program/VVNEZR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you type “import this” into a Python interpreter, you get PEP-20, 20* aphorisms that describe what “Good” Python code looks like. Most of these are prescriptive, and have been used to settle countless arguments about how Python should grow, or how new ideas should be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in these 20 aphorisms (which you may know as the “Zen of Python”), there are some inherent contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When “explicit is better than implicit” and “simple is better than complex”, what does it mean when being explicit means you must introduce complexity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When “readability counts” and “special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules”, what does it mean when making code more readable presents a special case in your codebase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer lies in one often-forgotten aphorism: “practicality beats purity”. When you can weigh practicality as a factor, you can decide that other factors are restrictive, and discard them as “impractical”. This idea shows up in many places in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type hints can help you to be explicit, but they introduce complexity. Focusing on practicality means you can adopt type hints only when you need them. Decorators are simple, but can be used to introduce ambiguity. In many cases, the practical benefits of decorators outweigh their potential for misuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how far can the pursuit of practicality let you go? Does practicality let you treat the other 19 aphorisms as optional? Does practicality give you an escape hatch from the rest of the Zen of Python?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll look at how practicality has been a guiding principle in the evolution of Python. We’ll look at how to weigh practicality in the face of the other 19 aphorisms of PEP-20, and we’ll look at how focusing on practicality can guide you towards these other attributes of good Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(* per PEP-20, the Zen of Python contains “20 aphorisms, only 19 of which have been written down.”)&lt;/p&gt;

Which is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing optional static typing in Python will bring with it some benefits that other languages have had for years: IDEs will be able to do code completion better; a whole class of boring tests will fall out automatically; and some bugs will be easier to catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is also undeniably a huge change of direction: will it mean you have to substantially change your code style? Will Python's simple expressiveness suddenly become unattainable thanks to clumsy Java-style type declarations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show how PEP 484's Gradual Typing system works, we're going to look at TypeScript, a minimal implementation of Gradual Typing over JavaScript. We'll see how the type system works, and how it fits into the already thriving JavaScript developer community, where most people aren't using type hints at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll draw some parallels with how Python's implementation will work, and see what Python can learn from a language that has successfully made the jump to a type-hinted world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New conferences rarely have resources to run the sort of outreach and inclusion programs that big conferences have. It’s hard to guess how much money you’ll have to spend, how many attendees you’ll have, and what your new community will look like. With so many things to worry about, it’s no surprise that most events don’t prioritise outreach until they’ve got a few years under their belt, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be this way, and it can even be easier to build a new event around outreach and inclusion than it is to build it in later on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shares the story of North Bay Python’s inaugural conference, which we planned in under 6 months, ran on a $40,000 budget, and built a welcoming community to make it real. We made inclusivity a founding principle and did so without compromising our speaker lineup while still attracting great sponsorship and hosted an event that almost every attendee wants to return to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’re going to share with you how we built a conference, from the ground up, to be as inclusive as we could make it. We’ll touch on early organisation, marketing, and on-the ground logistics. Throughout the talk, you’ll learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we designed a budget that let us prioritise outreach and inclusion activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we built the community that we wanted before the conference even started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we ran an event that proved that we meant everything we said&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You too can host a new conference with a great lineup on a shoestring budget and short timeline, and you can do it while being inclusive, welcoming, and putting attendee safety first. Find out how you can have your cake, eat it, and still have lots to share with your new community.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s common because setting up clean environments is slow, tedious, and error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, debugging errors introduced by incorrect environments is slow, tedious, and error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each step in your CI workflow theoretically only has inputs or outputs, but in reality, files can be left along the way by running tests or compiling extensions. These are side-effects, not inputs for subsequent steps in your workflow, let alone deployment, but if included they can affect correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can solve this using “hermetic environments”: running every step of your workflow inside a fresh environment, so steps run truly independently of one another. You can do this manually with Docker, but it’s difficult: you have to understand which inputs are necessary for a step, which newly generated files are meaningful outputs, and what should be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pantsbuild uses hermetic builds automatically: it understands the inputs each step needs, what outputs it produces, and stores inputs and outputs inside a content-addressable database so it can rapidly build sandboxed environments for subsequent steps of your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a build process where every step is run in isolation, with only the inputs each process truly needs, and only true outputs made available to each subsequent step. Pants’ workflows are fast but verifiably correct — running against incorrect inputs is not a possible failure case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll explore how Pantsbuild enables truly hermetic builds. We’ll look at other approaches to sandboxing and how they compare to Pants’ approach, and how you can benefit from adding hermetic builds to your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll walk away being confident that “works on my machine” means “works everywhere”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decorators like &lt;cite&gt;&amp;#64;wraps&lt;/cite&gt; or &lt;cite&gt;&amp;#64;classmethod&lt;/cite&gt; change the behaviour of a
callable, and do so by returning a new callable. Other decorators, like
&lt;cite&gt;&amp;#64;property&lt;/cite&gt; accept a callable, but leave something completely different in
their place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flexibility isn’t just there for decorators that come with Python. You
can use this flexibility in your own decorators, and it offers the potential
for you to build interesting and unexpected new behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll look at why Python has decorators, and how you can build
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at how some more popular decorators in Python do what they do.
Finally, we’ll look at how to harness decorators to do unexpected and
potentially horrible things with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this talk, you’ll know how decorators work, how to write your own
decorators, and how decorators enable you to do extremely weird things in
Python. Most importantly, you’ll understand how to use decorators
responsibly, and definitely not to confuse your friends and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

inadvisable. Many of the features that (left unchecked) allow you to do
inadvisable things were used to achieve things that have since become
necessary and defining features of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python – unlike many languages – discovered that leaving these obvious
and necessary features lying around next to inadvisable things was a bad
idea, and built guardrails around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life, guardrails are structures that make it easier to
understand how to be safe in an area where there is otherwise danger. If
respected, guardrails make you safer, but unlike walls or fences,
guardrails do not block you from danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, features like decorators, context managers, async functions,
importlib, and more are all guardrails that let you work with less-safe
Python machinery from a much safer distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’re going to explore the idea of guardrails as a design
philosophy, and use that to explain Python’s attitude to safely working
with the language and its internals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll explore features of Python that are guardrails around less-safe
features – what features they replaced, how those features could be used
incorrectly, and how the newer features allow you to use Python more
safely. As a special treat, you may also get to see how Python lets you
abuse these features*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll conclude with a discussion of how you can use Python’s guardrail
philosophy in your own code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re a community of volunteers, that justification can be less clear: cost-benefit analyses will rarely be about money. Worse still, the human costs can be difficult to justify: It’s difficult to get volunteers to do more unpaid work than they’re already doing. If your community depends on Open Source software, you get the added political difficulty of needing to navigate the divide between large-scale change and making small improvements to systems your community actively contributes to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the motivation might be different, the process isn’t: leading a community towards change means understanding why existing systems aren’t suitable, making your community enthusiastic about the need for change, and then actually making that change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help make this point more concretely, we’ll look at how and why linux.conf.au – a long-running Open Source conference in Australia – effected a move away away from a bespoke legacy conference management software to one based on Symposion, the popular Django-based software created for the Python Software Foundation. We’ll also look at how that’s led to the PSF funding Registrasion, a Django-based conference sales platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this case study as a guide, we’ll talk about how to make a decision to replace the software that your community runs on. In particular, we’ll cover how to identify and engage with stakeholders within a community; the value of prototypes in maintaining interest; and what a cost-benefit analysis might look like when your currencies are human joy, and burnout prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
