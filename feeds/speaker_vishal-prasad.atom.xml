Most of the core functionality of both can be built with great simplicity and clarity from plain coroutines, supplemented by elementary components of the Python 3.6 standard library (e.g. socket &amp;amp; queue). Building concurrency primitives from these raw materials is entertaining as an intellectual exercise, but also excellent in demystifying the aync tools which are all-too-often treated as magic.&lt;/p&gt;
