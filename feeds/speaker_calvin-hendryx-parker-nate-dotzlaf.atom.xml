In this presentation, we’ll show you how Indiana’s largest healthcare institution went from using proprietary tools that were hard to maintain and nearly impossible to scale — to implementing a new world of cloud native and open source tooling, including Airflow, Spark, Delta Lakes (delta.io) and Terraform. We’ll showcase how making a big change to a data pipeline infrastructure can:
* simplify and automate workflow processes;
* enable organizations to import existing and new data sources quickly, efficiently and at scale;
* keep costs down in relation to the number and volume of data sources;
* hire and onboard new developers — who have experience working with the open source tools — quickly, eliminating the tech learning curve that existed with the proprietary tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
