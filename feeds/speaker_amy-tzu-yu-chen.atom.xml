as important to advocate and maintain model health. Building data
science reports ahead of time can help. In this talk, let’s talk about
how to make useful data science reports for data scientists and business
stakeholders. You do not need to be an R user to follow along, but you
will see some useful R packages and tricks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will first walk through what data science reporting
means and how it is different from BI and general-purpose dashboards.
Next, we explore different options for producing data science reports in
a “loud” and clear way for data scientists and other technical and
non-technical business stakeholders. Throughout the talk, I will
introduce some useful R packages and tricks for building your own
reports, however, you do not need to be an R user because the same
principles apply. The talk is marked as intermediate but all levels are
welcome and should be able to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;
