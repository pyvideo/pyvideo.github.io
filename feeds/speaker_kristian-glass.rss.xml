&lt;p&gt;Hiring is hard, it's hard to do well, it's easy to do badly. Here's some
things to avoid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you control hiring decisions at work, maybe you're an interviewer
or applicant reviewer, or maybe you're trying to be hired somewhere -
chances are you're exposed to the hiring process somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's so many things you can do that are inadvertently problematic,
and they're so easy to do without realising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll show you a selection of things that people do, with all the best
intentions, and the problems that can arise, so you can avoid them and
do better!&lt;/p&gt;

Audience participation will be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to break into programming? Are you a junior developer wondering about the next steps in your career? Perhaps you're at a crossroads in your career and wonder what to do next? Is there a problematic issue about the workplace that you think should be discussed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submit your questions via this form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think &amp;quot;Question Time&amp;quot; on BBC1 at 10:30pm on a Thursday and you have a pretty good idea of what it will be like.&lt;/p&gt;

We all know we
should, but somehow we never quite do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we find it so hard? What can we do about it? Why does it even
matter? How can we get better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you're doing, whatever your background, these questions matter.&lt;/p&gt;
