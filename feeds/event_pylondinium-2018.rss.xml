So many questions for a tiny data structure so widely used. Let's learn together about it!&lt;/p&gt;

Elissa Shevinsky interviewed both established and emerging leaders in the Python community, and will share their insights on what is most exciting in Python in 2018. This is an opportunity to hear insights from other community members, and to acknowledge their contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shevinsky is documenting the contributions of women and under-represented people in the Python community, and continuously updating this talk as new people and interviews are added to the slides. Shevinsky is Editor of the anthology &amp;quot;Lean Out: The Struggle for Gender Equality in Tech and Startup Culture.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Our goal will be to obtain synthetic images of black holes (similar to those observed in the movie Interstellar) by recreating how the light propagates in an environment of extreme gravity, such as a rotating black hole. Using this as an excuse, we will analyse different approaches to optimise our code as much as possible using all the tools available in the Python ecosystem. We will also learn how to construct efficient scientific simulations in Python that can match the speed of any other programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

For most machine learning practitioners, mastering this art of tuning hyperparameters requires not only a competent background in machine learning algorithms, but also extensive experience working with real-world datasets. Most machine learning algorithms present a variety of hyperparameters to tune, and in the case of neural networks and deep learning models, the list of potential hyperparameters to adjust can increase exponentially. As such, deep learning models are notoriously tricky to optimally tune, where thorough exploration of architectures and hyperparameters is imperative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grid search and randomized search methodologies are traditionally used to tune model hyperparameters, however they are costly approaches and incorporate no notion of how trials of previous hyperparameters have performed. Bayesian Optimization is one such approach that forms knowledge about the relation between the hyperparameter settings and model performance in order to make a smarter choice for future parameter settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Zalando’s Fashion MNIST dataset, which comprises of 60,000 clothing images, I present the use of Bayesian Optimization to tune the hyperparameters of a convolutional neural network in Keras.&lt;/p&gt;

But isn't that incompatible with Python's fast, productive, dynamic typing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll introduce these things called 'types', and motivate and demonstrate their use in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

Time zones have skipped entire days and repeated others. There are time zones that switch to DST twice per year. But not necessarily every year. In Python it's even possible to create datetimes with non-transitive equality (&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;a == b&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;b == c&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;a != c&lt;/tt&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk you'll learn about Python's time zone model and other concepts critical to avoiding datetime troubles. Using &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;dateutil&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;pytz&lt;/tt&gt; as examples, this talk covers how to deal with ambiguous and imaginary times, datetime arithmetic around a Daylight Saving Time transition, and datetime's new fold attribute, introduced in Python 3.6 ([PEP 495](&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0495/"&gt;https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0495/&lt;/a&gt;)).&lt;/p&gt;

They made tools out of stones, houses out of wood, food out of the wilderness. They imagined, innovated and created. Suddenly there was civilization, there was commerce. People were interested in more than just day-to-day functioning but also in something called art. There were paintings, there was music, dance, drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the 1990’s with the onset of technology and the world-wide-web. From then to now, we have had Wifi, Google, Artificial Intelligence, AR/VR, Cryptocurrency. As Technology is getting more exciting, the misconception about it making humans a dull, monotonous species is also increasing. Instead, technology serves to be the medium through which creative thoughts are made into a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk aims to inspire both novices and professionals in the field to create. It will cover the unexplored applications of python programming in art and creativity by harnessing simple programming and mathematical techniques as well as by creating Artificially Intelligent Systems. The talk will cover a wide range of examples from bringing past artists back to life, integrating the cultures of the world with programming as well as examining real-life applications of artistically aimed python programming in music videos, museums and much more. Moreover, it will also cover the speaker’s role in the field and new, exciting areas to explore and prospective problems to solve to make humans a more creatively able and remarkable species.&lt;/p&gt;
