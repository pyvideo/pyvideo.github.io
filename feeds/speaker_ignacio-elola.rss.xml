[EuroPython 2015]
[20 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Science is a hot topic, and most data scientist use either Python
or R to do their jobs as main scripting language.
Being import.io data scientist for the last 2 years, all of them using
Python, I've come across many different problems and needs on how to
wrangle data, clean data, report on it and make predictions.
In this talk I will cover all main analytics and data science needs of
a start-up using Python, numpy, pandas, and sklearn.  For every use
case I will show snippets of code using IPython notebooks and run some
of them as live demos.&lt;/p&gt;
