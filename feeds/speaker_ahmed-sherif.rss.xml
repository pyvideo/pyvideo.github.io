Sentiment Analysis with Python</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/florida-pycon-2017/how-positive-are-your-tweets-sentiment-analysis-with-python.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder if tweets that are on your time line are trending positively
or negatively? Would you like to be able to see in real time if this is
happening to you or to a specific topic or hashtag? This talk will show
you how you can stream your tweets using a library called ‘tweepy’,
store them in a data frame using ‘pandas’, and then extract subjectivity
and polarity using textblob. Additionally, this talk will show you how
this can be done with python with minimal lines of code compared to this
same function being performed with R or SAS. After walking through the
steps, we will perform an actual live demo of capturing tweets using
audience participation.&lt;/p&gt;
