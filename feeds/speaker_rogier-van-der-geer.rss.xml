[EuroPython 2016]
[21 July 2016]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/a-genetic-algorithm-to-play-the-game-of-risk"&gt;https://ep2016.europython.eu//conference/talks/a-genetic-algorithm-to-play-the-game-of-risk&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular board game of Risk has many fans around the world.
Using a Python-based simulation of the game, we use a genetic
algorithm to train a risk-playing algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk we'll explain what genetic algorithms are and we'll
explain an entertaining use-case: how to win at popular board games.
During the talk we'll  demo how object oriented patterns help with the
design and implementation of these algorithms. We'll also demonstrate
a library that allows users to push their own risk bots into a game
and battle it out on.&lt;/p&gt;

But while it seems everyone is
using them, training your first neural network can be quite a hurdle to
overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will take you by the hand, and following an example image
classifier I trained, I will take you through the steps of making an
image classifier in PyTorch. I will show you code snippets and explain
the more intricate parts. Also, I will tell you about my experience, and
about what mistakes to prevent. After this all you need to start
training your first classifier is a data set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I will provide a link to the full codebase at the end. The
talk will focus on the practical aspect of training a neural network,
and will only touch the theoretical side very briefly. Some basic prior
knowledge of neural networks is beneficial, but not required, to follow
this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Liffey B on 2022-07-13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocols have been around since Python 3.8. So what are they, and how can they help you write better code? And how are they different from Abstract Base Classes? In this talk I will introduce you to both concepts (ABCs and Protocols), and show you by example how they can make your life easier, and your code cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
