&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Duct-taping” different systems together is a common task, and is
generally regarded as “mostly harmless”. However, “duct-taping” hides
much more pitfalls than a cursory examination might reveal, especially
when the constraints outside the developer’s control are many. In this
talk, a classification of the different integration scenarios is
presented, along with methodologies to identify them and asses their
complexity: those hiding the most dangerous pitfalls will be examined in
detail, and methodologies and best practices to avoid them will be
exposed, with a special care put into considerations about security and
scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
