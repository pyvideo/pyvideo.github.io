&lt;p&gt;Track: General: Community, Diversity, Carreer, Life and everything else
Working in the 21st century is very different from the past. Especially the digital space offers many opportunities to work in the office and remotely. In your hometown or somewhere else on the globe.  Some companies even work completely remotely.  Or, as a freelancer, you can be your own boss. Or running a company, where you are in charge of all the decisions. This panel invites folks with diverse careers to ponder the differences in these choices and give advice to you (and their former selves!) on choices along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded at the PyConDE &amp;amp; PyData Berlin 2022 conference, April 11-13 2022.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an intricate link between orthogonal polynomial families and well-known probability distributions. Known as Polynomial Chaos, this technique is largely unknown outside of some engineering fields. Nevertheless, the method allows us to model arbitrary distributions (with finite second moment) using distributions that are more familiar, e.g. the uniform or normal distributions. The polynomial chaos technique shifts the burden of understanding random variables to one of understanding deterministic series coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is particularly good for understanding dynamical systems with parametric uncertainty. The Polynomial Chaos expansion allows us to generate Monte Carlo simulations with far fewer simulation runs. In addition, we can use the method to quantify uncertainty in observations even when faced with small sample sizes. This talk will demonstrate the derivation of the technique and include some Python examples of ways it can be used to model systems and understand data in the presence of uncertainty. This will be a highly technical talk, touching on elements of measure-theoretic probability and functional analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
