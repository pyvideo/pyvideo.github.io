&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django is arguably the most secure web framework. The Django team have
done an excellent job making secure-by-default decisions for our web
applications in many situations. Still, the last mile in development is
where the bulk of security vulnerabilities can be introduced and
Django's powerful flexibility allows for plenty of rope for developers
to hang themselves. Understanding the vulnerabilities that can be
created by common mistakes or misconceptions and overlooked details in
development will be useful for any Django user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privacy and security are key parts of Mozilla's mission, and we build
some of the largest Django applications on the web, so being at the
absolutely forefront of security is crucial to us. And having a great
user experience is, too. So over the past few years, we've developed a
number of proposals, tools --like Bleach and django-ratelimit--and best
practices, and we've wrapped these up into our application template
Playdoh and an app called Funfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll share those best practices and their motivations. We'll also go
over a number of tools, settings, and even some fairly new web standard
proposals (with tools, of course) to help you build the most secure
Django applications you can, at whatever scale you're building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google App Engine is a unique hosting platform that lets you build
applications and run them in Google's data centers using the massive
global infrastructure built to run the Internet's most powerful company.
App Engine offers a development environment that uses familiar
technologies (Java and Python) and provides a powerful and robust set of
APIs to users while maintaining security and independence from other
apps running in the cloud. It is always free to get started so you can
try it out with no risk, and if you need additional computing resources,
you can purchase additional computing resources beyond the free quota
limits. (If you enable billing and trust us with your credit card, we
will extend your free quotas even further; you won't get charged until
you exceed those &lt;em&gt;extended&lt;/em&gt; quotas.) Scale your application to millions
of users and pay only for what you use at competitive market pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we provide an update of the newest features found in
the most recent releases of the App Engine platform. We also share some
suggestions for best practices to existing App Engine developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginners to the App Engine platform will be interested in the
introductory workshop which may be offered (see description below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google App Engine workshop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we'll give you a comprehensive introduction to the
platform in two/three components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-hour Introduction to Cloud computing and Google App Engine seminar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-hour App Engine hands-on workshop/codelab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first hour, we review Cloud Computing as an industry and where
Google App Engine fits into the picture. Specifically, we discuss App
Engine as a PaaS solution because of the inherent challenges of building
web and other applications. We'll outline the architecture of App
Engine, what it's major components are, introduce its features and APIs,
discuss the service and how it works (including information on the free
quotas), present some information about current users and usage,
including integration with Google Apps, and finally, give an overview of
its enterprise edition called Google App Engine for Business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the approximately one-hour lecture, we'll show you how to create
applications that run on App Engine by building a simple but real web
application from the ground up via a hands-on coding laboratory.
Although based on the online tutorial, this codelab goes up and beyond
what's in the documentation: you will get a more detailed step-by-step
instructions to replicate that example as well as have the opportunity
to extend your application with some of the newer APIs that come with
App Engine. The codelab will cover the Users service, non-relational
Datastore, and Memcache APIs. Time-permitting, we'll also discuss some
of the newest features found in recent App Engine releases.&lt;/p&gt;

response framework focused on remote live forensics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It consists of a Python client (agent) that is installed on target
systems, and Python server infrastructure that can manage and talk to
clients. The goal of GRR is to support forensics and investigations in a
fast, scalable manner to allow analysts to quickly triage attacks and
perform analysis remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRR was started at Google in 2009 as a simple Python helper script used
by Incident Response engineers. Eventually a little Python script got a
little server component, was adapted to run on multiple systems (Mac,
Linux, Windows), then a little UI was added and a few nice features were
introduced (large-scale hunts, collection of predefined artifacts,
memory analysis). A helper script has eventually evolved into a
sophisticated framework with 180,000 lines of Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;In the presentation we’ll talk about the process of evolving a small
prototype-like Python project into a production-ready system, using
GRR as an example. The topics that we’ll cover are:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Taking shortcuts - both in terms of design and implementation.
Reasons for taking them and their eventual costs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Relying on Python’s power features (i.e. meta-classes, mixins)?
Long-term consequences on maintainability and readability.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Organising the project into separate PyPI packages - benefits of
doing that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;* Continuous integration, testing and automated builds for various
platforms - implementation costs and maintainability effects.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know the basics of packaging your Python application for Docker, but do you know enough to run that image in production? Bad packaging can result in security and production problems, not to mention wasted time try to debug unreproducible errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if you figure out the best practices, there's still a huge number of details to get right, many of which interact with each other in unexpected ways. My personal list includes over 60 Docker packaging best practices, and it keeps growing. So where do you start? What should you do first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you quickly package your application in a production-ready way, this talk will give you a plan to help you prioritize and iteratively implement these best practices, by starting with the highest priority best practices (security, automation), moving on the correctness and reproducibility, and finally focusing on optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this process more concrete, along the way you'll also learn some of the techniques needed to build production-ready images:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running as a non-root, for increased security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging C crashes with faulthandler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster startup with pre-compiled .pycs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smaller images by disabling pip caching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding Alpine Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the talk you'll also get some resources to teach you even more best practices that can't be fit in a 30-minute talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for Python programmers who know the basics of Docker packaging, and need to run the resulting images in a production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are passing through an unknown street at midnight and you find that some anti-social elements are following you. To save yourself from them you start running and look for a safe place to hide. On the way, you will find a good person and requests him to help you. He hides you in his place to protect you. When these anti-social elements visit a good person’s place and enquire about you, the good person misguides them and redirects them to some other place in order to protect you. This is exactly how deception works. In this analogy, YOU are the resources to be protected, anti-social elements are the hackers who want to gain access to the resources, and a good person is a deception technique that protects the resources from hackers by making them fall in the trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk begins with an introduction to deception technology, deception types, and methods, a deceptive security life cycle. In this talk, we will demonstrate the following deception tools implemented using python language:
•       WebTrap (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/IllusiveNetworks-Labs/WebTrap"&gt;https://github.com/IllusiveNetworks-Labs/WebTrap&lt;/a&gt;): is designed to create deceptive webpages to deceive and redirect attackers away from real websites. The deceptive webpages are generated by cloning real websites, specifically their login pages.
•       DemonHunter (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/RevengeComing/DemonHunter"&gt;https://github.com/RevengeComing/DemonHunter&lt;/a&gt;):  is a distributed low interaction honeypot with Agent/Master design
Finally, we will conclude the talk with how built a deception tool and demonstrate its working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we implemented a deception tool in python using machine learning:
We designed a deception tool in python language using PyBRAIN package to model and mitigate XPath injection attacks for web services. It is known that XML can be used to store the data and this data can be queried using XPath query language. XPath is a query language, it has injection issues similar to SQL. To handle this issue, we proposed a solution, which uses a count-based validation technique and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modular neural networks to identify and classify atypical behavior in user input. Once the atypical user input is identified, the attacker is redirected to fake resources to protect the critical data. Our experiment resulted in over 90% accuracy in the classification of input vectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Native API call.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain combination of native API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calling sequence of native API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;APIs that handle the same register.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We not only define malicious activities and their stages but also develop weights and thresholds for calculating the threat level of a malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malware evolved with new techniques to gain difficulties for reverse engineering. Obfuscation is one of the most commonly used techniques. In this talk, we present a Dalvik bytecode loader with the order theory of android malware to neglect certain cases of obfuscation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the design principles of the CPython interpreter, our Dalvik bytecode loader consists of functionalities such as 1. Finding cross-reference and calling sequence of the native API. 2. Tracing the bytecode register. The combination of these functionalities (yes, the order theory) not only can neglect obfuscation but also match perfectly to the design of our malware scoring system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, we will also show a case study of Android malware and demonstrate how the obfuscation technique is useless to our engine. Last but not least, we will be open-sourcing everything (Malware Scoring System, Dalvik Bytecode Loader) during our presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience
1. Who is this talk for?
- Anyone who's interested in cyber security or anyone that wants to know how to build an anti-virus engine with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. What background knowledge or experience do you expect the audience to have?
- A little of Android application development and malware analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. What do you expect the audience to learn or do after watching the talk?
- The Dalvik bytecode loader is written as a python module, the audiences can use this module to boost up their malware analysis.
- The malware scoring system can be applied not only to Android malware but also can be applied for PE files or ELF files in other OS. The audience can copy our ideas to extend their work.
- Everything’s open-sourced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Introduction of Malware Scoring System.
First, we will detail how we decode Criminal Law to simple principles. For example, principles to define crime, penalty and the order theory of criminal, etc. And then we will detail how do we develop the order theory of android malware and other developed theories that construct the malware scoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Design Logic of the Dalvik Bytecode Loader.
Once the malware scoring system were built, this will discuss the design logic of our Dalvik bytecode loader which includes our obfuscation-neglect module and bytecode register tracing module. We will also detail why the order theory of android malware succeeds at neglecting the obfuscation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Quark Engine Practice - Case Study of Android Malware
Next, we will practice our engine and case study through an android malware. Moreover, we will also demonstrate our obfuscation-neglect technique against obfuscation malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Future works
Here, we will discuss the limitations of our engine. For example, the challenge of our Dalvik bytecode loader. Also, we will share our plans of implementing more detection techniques conquering the escape detection of malware.&lt;/p&gt;

While is it exciting and rewarding to share your ideas with the world it isn't always easy. Thinking about licenses, copyrights, and protecting confidential information is a must!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in a large organization which is embracing the mantra 'open source first' is really exciting. Part of this journey is to make sure we give back to the open source community when we can. Two of our projects had gained traction internally: datacompy, and locopy. As part of our commitment we wanted to make sure we could open source these projects for others to use and contribute back to. DataComPy is a package to compare two Pandas DataFrames. Originally started to be something of a replacement for SAS's PROC COMPARE for Pandas DataFrames with some more functionality than just Pandas.DataFrame.equals(Pandas.DataFrame) (in that it prints out some stats, and lets you tweak how accurate matches have to be). Then extended to carry that functionality over to Spark Dataframes. Locopy helps load flat files to S3 and then to Amazon Redshift, and assist with ETL processing. It is DB Driver (Adapter) agnostic, provides basic functionality to move data to S3 buckets, execute COPY commands to load data to S3, and into Redshift, and UNLOAD commands to unload data from Redshift into S3. While building these products was exciting and fun, some of the legal considerations were as interesting, complex, and required collaboration between many teams, from security, licensing, brand, and IP/copyright. We'll explore the projects, and some of these other considerations which can make or break if you decide to release a project into the wild, along with the road blocks we faced with in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

A threat model can help analyze how to best protect your assets, prevent attacks, harden your systems, and efficiently prioritize security investment. Regardless of programming language, threat modeling provides a far greater return than most any other security technique in the development process. Therefore, threat modeling should be an early priority in application design process. Unfortunately, it is common knowledge that building a full threat model is always heavily resource intensive, requires a full team of expensive security professionals, takes up far too much developer time, and does not scale at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the common knowledge is wrong! In fact, this is not at all necessary, and should not be an excuse to avoid building a robust system. Using a value-driven approach, skilled development teams can very efficiently ensure that the features they build can protect themselves, the application, and the business value that the features were created for. Value Driven Threat Modeling offers an alternative to top-heavy, big-model-up-front threat modeling that security pros love, in favor of agility, speed, and developer independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe Value Driven Threat Modeling, and show how to incorporate it into your existing agile development. We will discuss how developers can efficiently produce and leverage a threat model to improve application development, and walkthrough some example scenarios. If you want to be a good developer in 2018, you need to prepare for the threats of 2020!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuzz testing is a well-known technique for uncovering programming
errors. Atheris is an open-source fuzzing engine for finding bugs in
Python code and native extensions, released by the Google Information
Security team. With this talk we’ll learn how Atheris works and how it
can be used in practice. Fuzz testing is a well-known technique for
uncovering programming errors. Many of these detectable errors have
serious security implications. Atheris ( is an open-source fuzzing
engine for automatically finding bugs in Python code and native
extensions. Atheris is a “coverage-guided” fuzzer, which means that
Atheris will repeatedly try various inputs to your program while
watching how it executes, and try to find interesting execution paths.
In the past, Atheris was used to find bugs in Pillow’s native code
(CVE-2020-35653) or to find differences in JSON parsing between Python’s
standard library and Ultrajson, or between Python’s idna package and the
native libidn2 library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk you can learn the basics of fuzzing, how Atheris works
internally, and how it can be used for bug hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardcoding credentials in source code is a known bad practice, but it is
still happening every day, even on public platforms like GitHub.
Credential Digger is an open source scanning tool that can help
developers find and remediate to their exposed credentials with a low
false positive rate. Github is now widely adopted in the software
development industry as internal and external code hosting, sharing and
versioning platform. Even if this platform offers advanced code control
features it remains exposed to security weaknesses. In this talk we will
discuss about Github security concepts and introduce an SAP Open Source
tool called Credential Digger used to scan Git platforms (GitHub,
GitLab, BitBucket, etc.) in order to identify hardcoded credentials
(Passwords, API Keys, Secret Keys, Tokens, personal information,
internal domains, etc.). Compared to other secret scanners in the
market, Credential Digger is able to identify passwords with a low false
positive rate. Thanks to a NLP model we trained for this purpose, we can
identify when passwords are fake and when they are real. Together with
Credential Digger, we also work on a real time Github Organization
monitor that analyzes permanently the new commits on the projects of a
team, and alerts the owner when a potential secret is shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, a paper is published to demonstrate how a visibly valid
contribution can contain malicious code by exporting the Unicode control
characters. Some of these attacks has been tested on Python and it
works. Shall the Python and open-source communities be concerned?
Background:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After researchers at the University of Cambridge published a paper(
about a malicious attack named Trojan Source, which exploited the fact
that some program interpreters, like CPython, can handle Unicode. This
has caused concerns in the open-source community about the malicious
contribution that looks totally legitimate in human eyes but contain
invisible attacks. As a member of the Python community, we should all be
aware of that and understand how we can prevent this attack to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About this talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Cheuk will decode the finding in this paper to a level
that can be understood by everyone. She will start with a joke example
who you can mess up someone by using Unicode. She will then explain what
is Unicode and why it causes trouble. Afterwards, she will explain the
Python examples( in the paper and why it can be dangerous. Lastly, she
will open up a discussion on how we should defend ourselves from those
attacks and what we can do as a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline (30 mins talk):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**5 minutes - Introduction, the opening of the talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Cheuk will ask audiences to debug a code snippet that
looks absolutely fine but will not work as code. She will explain that
this is the same concept used in Trojan Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**10 mins - What is Unicode&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Cheuk will give an introduction about what is Unicode,
what it is to a computer and why we need Unicode in computers. She will
also explain how the benefit of having Unicode can also be a downfall to
make us vulnerable to the Trojan Source attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**10 mins - How Trojan Source works in Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Cheuk will show a few examples using the Trojan Source
in legitimate Python code. She will point out how the attack is hiding
in the source code and in what cases it can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**5 mins - How to protect ourselves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Cheuk will open the discussion and make a few
suggestions of how we can protect ourselves as a community. This will
lead to the Q&amp;amp;A session where the audience can weigh in on their own
thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target audiences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From those who are curious to maintainers of open-source libraries. This
is the knowledge we should all know and be aware of. Cheuk will explain
in a way that expects no prior knowledge is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will audiences learn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About Trojan Source attacks and how it works. They may also learn about
how interpreters, especially Python interpreters, works with Unicode.
Plus, they may have increased awareness about security in the
open-source world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees of this talk will walk away with a thorough understanding of

&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multi-factor authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encrypted DNS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH/VPN tunnels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;full disk encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compartment isolation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“onion-skin” routing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, digital interactions with other people increasingly occur
via hosted services, which while convenient can compromise the privacy,
integrity, and control of our data. With some open-source software and
inexpensive virtual servers, we can take back control and empower us all
to securely share our lives with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seattle is an open-source platform for developing and deploying
networked applications. Core feature of Seattle is that it allows safe
execution of untrusted code on end-user systems. In our talk we look at
how we used Python to build a safe, restricted code execution
environment for Seattle that not only provides execution safety but also
enforces strict resource consumption limits. In addition, Seattle
includes a high-level API to hide inconsistent OS-specific behaviors
from developers. What results is a platform that welcomes the
participation of end-user machines for general-purpose distributed
programming and creates new possibilities for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Geremy Condra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python's dynamic nature, large standard library, and concern for beauty
over performance make it an elegant and uniquely easy to use language,
but they also cause some unique problems. In this talk we'll explore how
features ranging from dictionaries to duck typing can become security
risks, demonstrate those attacks on real Python projects, and examine
how you can protect yourself and your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, an increasing body of evidence has accumulated
indicating that even when a system is hardened enough to provide strong
guarantees about its high-level behavior, implementation details and
especially performance properties can still provide attackers with an
easy way in. For Python, this is especially problematic: its generally
high-level view and the emphasis placed on flexibility often mean that
it can be difficult to stop attackers from gaining a foothold, while its
comparatively low execution speed increases the efficacy of wide variety
of implementation and timing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help Pythonistas understand and cope with these problems, we've
divided this talk into two parts: in the first, we demonstrate the
attacks against a series of widely-deployed Python projects with the
goal of both improving awareness about the issue and demonstrating
common weaknesses to be avoided. The second demonstrates effective
countermeasures and alternative constructions with the goal of improving
defenders' odds of spotting and correcting these flaws in their own
code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Geremy Condra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an attacker's point of view there are few entry points with as much
to offer as a vulnerable software updater, yet history tells us that
such vulnerabilities are common. In this talk we'll demonstrate a number
of attacks, explain how common approaches fail to defend against them,
and demonstrate a pure Python library (TUF) that provides both robust
protection and extreme ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerabilities in software update systems expose users to huge range of
potential security risks, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freeze attacks,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix-and-match attacks,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rollback attacks, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endless data attacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of this talk, we'll demonstrate each of these against
real- world software updaters and explain how commonly used
countermeasures fail in application. We'll then move on to the second
part of the talk, demonstrating TUF, its internals, and the mechanisms
it uses to additionally defend against key compromise. Finally, we'll
demonstrate how easy it is to integrate TUF into your application and
its lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

You don't want that, so let's go over a few things you can do to dissuade attackers from getting their grubby mitts on your hard processed datastore. We'll cover the obvious things (spoiler alert: encryption) and then some advanced techniques for keeping data secure while still keeping it usable (that is to say, analyzable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come join us by the fire as we have Security Story Time with our friends, Frog and Toad. With them, you'll learn about all the things Django does to protect users and developers out of the box. We'll look at simplified code samples from the Django codebase to see what's happening under the hood, and cover how to make the Django security model even stronger in your application.&lt;/p&gt;
