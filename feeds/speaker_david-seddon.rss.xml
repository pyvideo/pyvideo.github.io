&lt;p&gt;What if you don't want a Cat to be an Animal? What is the Liskov Substitution Principle? And what on earth is contravariance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discover the answers to these questions and more, as we explore the foundations of generic types in Python. And by the end, you might even understand the weirder errors that Mypy sometimes throws your way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyCon India is the largest gathering of Pythonistas in India for the Python programming language.
The 13th edition of PyCon India took place online from 17th Sept to 20th Sept 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

This can be perilous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, David will explore in detail how concurrency is handled by Django, and by the database. You'll learn key concepts, common pitfalls and gain a solid foundation in how to write code that is concurrency-safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk has plenty of tips that are relevant to all Python developers that work with databases.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a shame! Find out how to write tests that act as living documentation from which you can gain deeper understanding of your system.&lt;/p&gt;

Not well known in the Python world, it's an influential development approach that aims to 'tackle complexity in the heart of software'. If you're working on complex problems, come find out more: it may change the way you think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been writing code for 25 years. Over that time I've been through a few, rare, exhilarating paradigm shifts where my thinking as a developer suddenly changed. One was early on, when I suddenly understood object oriented programming. Test driven development was another. And then, six years ago, I read Eric Evan's 2003 book Domain Driven Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book opened up for me a whole new way of thinking about the practice of software development. It is focused not on traditional technical concerns we're used to reading about, but on the conceptual world of modelling. It views an application's domain model as one of its most important assets, and presents a wealth of wisdom about how to orient our thinking, code and working practices around that model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for some reason, these ideas are not well known in the Python community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now work on a highly complex project: Kraken, a Python monolith of tens of thousands of modules, serving energy and utility companies in a variety of countries. Domain Driven Design has, for me, been an invaluable influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll outline the key ideas of Domain Driven Design, ideas that are beyond any one language, technology or architecture. I'll also ground it with some practical examples of how it can look in Python. Are you looking for your next paradigm shift? Perhaps this could be it!&lt;/p&gt;
