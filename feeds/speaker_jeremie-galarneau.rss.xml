This knowledge is handy to both improve performance of Python applications and understand the interactions between multiple applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since kernel traces contain so much information, we need powerful tools to filter through the noise. Babeltrace 2's Python bindings allow developers to quickly build scripts that identify a number of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will rely primarily on demos showing how to instrument a Python application, how to trace both the application and the Linux kernel, and how to extract meaningful metrics using LTTng analyses and the Babeltrace Python bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
