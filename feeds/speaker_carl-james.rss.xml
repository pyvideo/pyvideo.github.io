I have no boss to answer to. I have no
partner to work with. Most of the apps I produce are for me to use. When
I was learning Python with online videos, I was introduced to testing. I
found it interesting, but it felt time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went back to an old app I had written and wanted to re-work. I
was lost. I couldn’t even figure out where to begin to make it work
again. I slowly decided to integrate testing into my personal workflow
on projects. Then I came upon an unexpected benefit: by testing my code
in a Django app, I was able to better learn what the library was doing
to convert a request into a response. I knew the steps, but through
writing a test with an expected output and seeing the error messages on
failures, I now intuitively understand how this process works. This talk
will demonstrate that.&lt;/p&gt;
