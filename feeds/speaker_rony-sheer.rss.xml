Could it be that we are not teaching the right stuff? For the past year, Rony Sheer has been running the Code4Change hacking program at Tichonet High School and has lessons from the trenches. How do you teach teenagers to build Django apps together? How can agile methodology change education? What happens when you stop teaching “programming” and start teaching “making”? This is a talk about our role in introducing young people to code.&lt;/p&gt;
