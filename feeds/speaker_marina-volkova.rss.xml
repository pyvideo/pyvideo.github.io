&lt;p&gt;In the field of cybersecurity, data scientists use computational methods
to develop more effective ways to find security threats hidden in data
flows of IT network communications. This talk, focused on data
scientists, will provide a moderately technical representation of how
machine learning and data science solve real-life problems,
demonstrating how threat detection is enriched and improved through
machine learning and data science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ups and downs of AI and ML in this application: Whatâ€™s so
complicated about cybersecurity anyway? * Machine Learning taxonomy:
classification, clustering, anomaly detection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When is an anomaly an anomaly, and when is it not an anomaly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we built Machine Learning spaceships to identify one of the
oldest and most persistent attack vectors (i.e. SQL Injections): Big,
Bigger, and the Biggest versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trade-off with accuracy and complexity: Do we need to destroy a
planet to get rid of SQL injections?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
