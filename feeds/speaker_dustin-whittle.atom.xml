&lt;p&gt;The performance of your application affects your business more than you
might think. Top engineering organizations think of performance not as a
nice-to-have, but as a crucial feature of their product. Unfortunately,
most engineering teams do not regularly test the performance and
scalability of their infrastructure. Dustin Whittle shares the latest
techniques and tools for performance testing modern web and mobile
applications. Join this session and learn how to capacity plan and
evaluate performance and the scalability of the server-side through
Siege, Bees with Machine Guns, and Locust.io. We will dive into modern
performance testing on the client-side and how to leverage
navigation/resource timing apis and tools like Google PageSpeed and
SiteSpeed.io to understand the real world performance of your users. We
will cover how HTTP2 and modern browsers change the game for performance
optimization with new best practices. Take back an understanding of how
to automate performance and load testing and evaluate the impact it has
on performance and your business.&lt;/p&gt;
