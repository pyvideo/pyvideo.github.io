We demonstrate the value of open-source science community building and getting there through reliance on the open-source Jupyter ecosystem, pre-packaged GitHub and BinderHub-based infrastructure, and documentation for creating, sharing, testing, and maintaining Pythia Cookbooks for their computational narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
