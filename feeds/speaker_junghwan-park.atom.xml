Here’re some agenda I'm currently thinking about: - How we got started (since 2018) - How we're growing (during Covid-19) - What we want to do in the future - A guide for people who want to start a local community I’d like to talk about what inspired me to start the community, what I've learned along the way, and what other maintainers and I wish having done more of. I'll also include some tips and suggestions for those who want to start a local community like in Korea. With this talk, I hope to make more people aware of how the PyToch user community in Korea has been self-sustaining, and give them the courage to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
