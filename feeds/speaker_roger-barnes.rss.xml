&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that python is fantastic when it comes to rapid
prototyping and development. When it comes to deploying a web
application, the road to glory isn't as well paved and navigating the
array of techniques and tools can be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will address the advantages of continuous deployment, the
success factors involved and the tools available, mainly focusing on
experiences with Django web development.&lt;/p&gt;

from disparate sources. To that end, a series of well established data
warehousing practices have emerged to extract data and produce a
consistent data store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will look at some options for composing workflows using
Python. In particular, we'll explore beyond Celery's asynchronous task
processing functionality into its workflow (aka Canvas) system and how
it can be used in conjunction with SQLAlchemy's architecture to provide
the building blocks for data stream processing.&lt;/p&gt;

revenue is becoming more and more apparent with established companies
regularly reporting the benefits of reducing page load times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover: * Designing for performance * Approaches to
instrumenting and measuring application performance * Areas of focus
for both front-end and back-end improvement * Techniques, tools and
modules available in Django-land for improving performance * New and
emerging technologies, for example SPDY protocol and Django 1.5's
