It has remained an unsolved problem for 20+ years. Is Python uniquely cursed in this category? Do we just need more tools? What if the ecosystem just standardized on {tool X}?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Peter will explain why Python has a uniquely hard problem to solve, sitting in the crosshairs of 5 very different kinds of challenges. Ironically, each of these challenges can be traced back to a core strength or value of Python and its open source ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will not offer any new comprehensive solutions, but will hopefully will give a holistic perspective of the fundamental drivers of complexity around Python and packaging. This can hopefully help orient future discussions, help tool makers surface opportunities for collaboration and consolidation, and help users better understand which subset of the 5 demons of packaging they are fighting at any given point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

By some measures, Open Source is a wildly successful and crucial part of many areas of modern technology. However, the ’sustainability crisis’ and the age of cloud computing have threatened its core mechanisms. Peter will present some alternative ways of looking at this crucial moment in the evolution of the open source movement, and suggest some ways to think about the future of open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation today appears to be instantaneous in large part due to open source technology. Open Data Science is no exception. Python, a pillar in the Open Data Science bedrock, is well positioned to harvest innovation in software and with Anaconda, it’s also well positioned to capitalize on the latest hardware innovations. Anaconda and Intel are blazing a path for the Python community to take advantage of cognitive computing, including machine learning and deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this keynote, Peter and Robert will talk about how Open Data Science––a connected ecosystem of data, analytics and compute––streamlines the path to high performance and innovation to achieve breakthrough results.&lt;/p&gt;

the relationships in multidimensional datasets, uses a Protovis-like
expression syntax scheme for creating novel visualizations, and is
designed from the ground up to be used on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

the relationships in multidimensional datasets, uses a Protovis-like
expression syntax scheme for creating novel visualizations, and is
designed from the ground up to be used on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it can be thought of as &amp;quot;ggplot for Python&amp;quot;, the goals of Bokeh
are much more ambitious. The Grammar of Graphics primarily addresses the
mapping of pre-built aeshetics and layouts to a particular data schema
and tuples of measure variables. It has limited facility for expressing
data interactivity, and its small set of graph types (aka &amp;quot;geoms&amp;quot; or
glyphs) are somewhat limited in both their number and in the number of
ways they can be combined with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, most existing Python plotting frameworks adopt a &amp;quot;tell
me how&amp;quot; instead of a &amp;quot;tell me what&amp;quot; approach. Thus, user plotting code
canfrequently become mired down in what amounts to details of the
rendering system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our talk, we will show various features of Bokeh, and talk about
future development. We will also go into some detail about how Bokeh
unifies the tasks of describing data mapping, building data-driven
layout, and composing novel visualizations using a single, multi-purpose
scene and data graph.&lt;/p&gt;
