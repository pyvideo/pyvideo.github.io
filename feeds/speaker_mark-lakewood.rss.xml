developer, but with so many different servers out there its hard to
choose which one to use. Buildbot has a pretty steep learning curve, but
rewards with a very light footprint and amazing flexibility and
configurability. In this talk I will walk through the build(ing) blocks
and concepts required to put together a simple CI server based upon
buildbot, and also suggest some more advanced features.&lt;/p&gt;
