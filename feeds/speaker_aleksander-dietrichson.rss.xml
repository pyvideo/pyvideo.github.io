I identify three main areas of challenges and show how at Universidad Nacional de San Martín (Argentina) we addressed each of the areas through a combination of original curriculum redesign, production of course materials appropriate for the students in question; and the use of OS, and some Posit products, i.e.:posit.cloud and Quarto. I show how these technologies can be used as a pedagogical tool to overcome the challenges mentioned, even on a shoestring budget.&lt;/p&gt;

Using reinforcement learning, a custom computer vision model, and browser automation –all implemented in R/Python– I was able to create an AI that played the game to perfection. In this presentation, I will share the lessons learned as I went through this process and some hints to avoid the pitfalls I tackled. I will present some real-world business cases to answer the obvious why-question. For colleagues who teach Data Science and AI, I will show how an activity such as this can provide the entry point and basis for discussion for more than half a dozen topics, ranging from formal logic, game theory, and empirical inference, all the way to Shiny and Quarto.&lt;/p&gt;
