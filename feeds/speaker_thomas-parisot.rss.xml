LibreOffice application, to write some content, to make a backup, to
send it by email to the publisher and to deal with the feedbacks. And
repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However in 2017 we can do differently by using open formats like
Asciidoc, by using version control to propagate changes, by using
collaborative platforms like GitHub or GitLab to collate feedbacks in
any form as well as transforming text and code into readable and
interactive artefacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gives us a unique opportunity to approach the whole process of
writing in term of &amp;quot;content experience&amp;quot;, of &amp;quot;toolchain&amp;quot; and of
&amp;quot;distribution&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, a &amp;quot;book&amp;quot; becomes a &amp;quot;writing format&amp;quot; as we can reuse the same
pattern to manage any kind of &amp;quot;content&amp;quot; — articles, publications,
essays, documentation — that we can transform in physical books,
e-books, interactive web pages etc.&lt;/p&gt;
