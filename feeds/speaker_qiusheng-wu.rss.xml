We will cover the basics of Earth Engine data types and how to visualize, analyze, and export Earth Engine data in a Jupyter environment using geemap. We will also demonstrate how to develop and deploy interactive Earth Engine web apps. Throughout the session, practical examples and hands-on exercises will be provided to enhance learning. The attendees should have a basic understanding of Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Familiarity with Earth science and geospatial datasets is not required, but will be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

This integration empowers you to harness Earth Engine's vast data catalog and compute power directly within your preferred Python workflows. For example, the Xee library leverages Xarray's lazy evaluation and Dask to streamline the extraction and analysis of Earth Engine data, offering a more Pythonic alternative to traditional image exports. Earth Engine's new data extraction interfaces unlock fresh geospatial analysis potential by leveraging the unique strengths of both the scientific Python ecosystem and Earth Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
