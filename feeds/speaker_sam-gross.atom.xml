&lt;p&gt;[The Auditorium on 2022-07-15]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPython’s “Global Interpreter Lock”, or “GIL”, prevents multiple threads from executing Python code in parallel. The GIL was added to Python in 1992 together with the original support for threads in order to protect access to the interpreter’s shared state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python supports a number of ways to enable parallelism within the constraints of the GIL, but they come with significant limitations. Imagine if you could avoid the startup time of joblib workers, the multiprocess instability of PyTorch’s DataLoaders, and the overhead of pickling data for inter-process communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “nogil” project aims to remove the GIL from CPython to make multithreaded Python programs more efficient, while maintaining backward compatibility and single-threaded performance. It exists as a fork, but the eventual goal is to contribute these changes upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the changes to Python to let it run efficiently without the GIL and what these changes mean for Python programmers and extension authors.&lt;/p&gt;

frameworks in AI/ML has faced challenges keeping up with performance
demands. To mitigate this, parts of PyTorch have been moved into C++.
This approach goes against the original intent of PyTorch as a
Python-based framework and complicates contributions from the community.
The PyTorch development team recognized the need to address these
challenges while maintaining PyTorch's Python roots and set ambitious
goals to improve performance, decrease memory usage, enable
state-of-the-art distributed capabilities, and ensure more PyTorch code
is written in Python. To achieve these goals, they developed a Python
compiler. Attendees of this talk will get an inside look at how the
PyTorch development team approached these challenges and implemented
their innovative solution to achieve a 43% speedup in performance. We
will discuss the benefits and challenges of this approach, as well as
the techniques and technologies used to build the PyTorch Python
compiler. This talk will provide valuable insights into the development
process of and offer attendees a deeper understanding of how PyTorch
continues to evolve and innovate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing Pyrefly: A Scalable Type Checker for a Unified IDE Experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're excited to introduce Pyrefly, a new type checker designed with scalability in mind. Built from the ground up using Rust, Pyrefly provides a faster and more efficient type checking experience, enabling developers to write better code with confidence. With Pyrefly, we aim to deliver a unified IDE experience power type hints and code navigation on a new type checking engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlocking Better Performance with Free-Threaded Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the Python community, we've been working on making free-threaded Python (No-GIL) available in Python 3.13. This significant milestone allows developers to take full advantage of modern multi-core processors directly from Python. More recently, our efforts have focused on improving the single-threaded performance of the free threading build, ensuring that Python remains a top choice for developers seeking high-performance capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
