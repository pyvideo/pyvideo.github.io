I have been taught programming by the Python community, and currently, I have been teaching python to children in my local community. Throughout elementary and middle school, I have been taught programming in many different ways. Then in late middle school, I taught programming to children at my local library. In this talk, I have compiled many teaching methods that I have found useful when learning python/teaching python. I also cover the ages to start coding, access to computers, and teaching at school vs. an after-school program. With the help of several coding teachers, school principals, and after-school coding program directors, I hope that this talk will serve as a guide to anyone who wants to teach python or find a good way to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
