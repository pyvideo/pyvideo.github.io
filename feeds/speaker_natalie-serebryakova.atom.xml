governance, compliance, and security controls are implemented in the
development process. The domain-agnostic nature of Open Policy Agent
makes it well-suited for policy management and evaluation for tasks like
that. The Implementation example will be developing a solution for
managing SCM (Source Control Management) security at any organization or
project's whole CI/CD pipeline. This part of the talk aims to
demonstrate how to use Python Open Policy Agent (OPA) Client and build
policies to verify the security of SCM (Gitlab or Github)
organization/repositories/user accounts. The good practices to automate
those Policies to Satisfy Common Concerns will be covered in the
presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
