reduction platforms towards more sophisticated Python applications,
non-technically- focused users can struggle with installing and
maintaining a large number of heterogeneous dependencies. PyRAF has
successfully bridged the gap between IRAF and Python, but managing
dependencies falls outside its scope. A few existing Python
distributions make installation easy, but don't cater for specific needs
(such as dependence on IRAF). STScI and Gemini have therefore developed
a prototype, easy-to-install software distribution for Linux and OSX
known provisionally as the 'Unified Release' (UR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the UR includes STScI Python and its dependencies (eg. Python,
NumPy, IRAF 2.15), as well as Matplotlib &amp;amp; Tk, SciPy, a number of IRAF
packages, DS9, X11IRAF and some testing and documentation tools. Its
scope extends to complementary non-Python/IRAF software, but we do not
intend to produce a comprehensive (Scisoft-like) distribution of tools
for astronomy, nor to satisfy every installation preference. Our focus
is on providing a simple way to run key tools, for users with minimal
support resources and who may not have administrative privileges. Unlike
most comparable distributions, our approach includes basic provision for
in-place software additions and updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently we have completed a first internal version of the UR for both
Linux and OSX, which we shall briefly demonstrate. We plan to make our
first public release during the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

astronomical researchers. A prominent example is in the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope (LSST), a project which will repeatedly observe the
southern sky 1000 times over the course of 10 years. The 30,000 GB of
raw data created each night will pass through a processing pipeline
consisting of C++ and legacy code, stitched together with a python
interface. This example underscores the need for astronomers to be
well-versed in large-scale statistical analysis techniques in python. We
seek to address this need with the AstroML package, which is designed to
be a repository for well-tested data mining and machine learning
routines, with a focus on applications in astronomy and astrophysics. It
will be released in late 2012 with an associated graduate-level
textbook, 'Statistics, Data Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy'
(Princeton University Press). AstroML leverages many computational tools
already available available in the python universe, including numpy,
scipy, scikit- learn, pymc, healpy, and others, and adds efficient
implementations of several routines more specific to astronomy. A main
feature of the package is the extensive set of practical examples of
astronomical data analysis, all written in python. In this talk, we will
explore the statistical analysis of several interesting astrophysical
datasets using python and astroML.&lt;/p&gt;

absence of shared efforts in the field. While there are well known, free
software tools available for astronomy, most have been developed by
large institutions, and the past few decades have seen comparatively
little progress in fostering a community-based set of software tools.
There is hope that is changing now. The continuing growth of Python in
astronomy has led to an increasing awareness of needless duplication of
efforts within the community and the need to make existing packages work
better with each other; such discussions came to a head on the astropy
email list in the spring of 2011 leading to formation of the astropy
project. The first coordination meeting was held in the fall of 2011,
and significant progress has been made in setting up a community
repository of core astronomical packages. We will describe the general
goals of astropy and the progress that has been made to date.&lt;/p&gt;
