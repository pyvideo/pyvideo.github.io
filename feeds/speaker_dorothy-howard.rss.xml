From reviewing pull requests to conflict resolution, maintenance involves many forms of work, yet certain tasks and roles are prominent than others. We draw on the concepts of visible and invisible work to analyze the infrastructures which configure different forms of recognition. We also explore the attributes of burnout to consider the ways that open source knowledge production permeates peoplesâ€™ lives and how burnout affects community sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
