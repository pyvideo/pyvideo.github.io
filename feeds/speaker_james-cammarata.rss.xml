The
idea is if &amp;quot;&amp;quot;release early, release often&amp;quot;&amp;quot; is good, releasing very
often is better. It's not trivial. Automation is part of the battle, and
testing is another. Learn to use tools like Jenkins and Ansible to move
from deploying software once a month to 15 times every hour, and why
you'll want to.&lt;/p&gt;
