&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk will answer all these questions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;You will learn: - how to develop the idea from scratch,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- how to use principles of Object Oriented Analysis and Design,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- how to show amazing architecture design.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will get better understanding where and how to start, analyze and
decouple the system, create a clean, clear and extendable architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Have you ever had the task when you need to use one function in few
places and you really wanted to avoid of code duplicating? For example
to add some logging into functions or timers, etc. Decorators in
Python are super powerful with these tasks, but at the same time they
are super complicated, sometimes even magical. When I started learning
Python, Decorators were really like a magic: how to use them, how are
they working, lots of questions. The goal is to make the things easier
and clear to answer a question: to use or not to use Decorators in
your project.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;What’s in the Talk:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Functions nature in Python&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Magic of a Decorator&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Basics&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- When to use Decorators&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Examples&lt;/div&gt;

different teams. Setting up all necessary Agile meetings and using
buzz words is not enough for the team to be happy and successful while
working in Agile environment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Inspired by the &amp;quot;Divine Comedy&amp;quot; by Dante Alighieri, I decided to
create a short guide into Agile best practices. It will guide through
Failures, Challenges to the Success in building a happy dream team!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk is divided into three parts:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1. Failures in setting up Agile processes for a team.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2. Challenges on the way to happy and successful team.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;3. Successful examples how to have happy and productive Agile team and
constantly deliver a great product.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when your features are done, your MVP is ready and you want to deploy your first production build? What do you do then? How do you make your first production build instead of re-using your development one? is your code ready to handle real user interactions?
This talk will show a production ready checklist for your Python code; what to look for when creating a production-ready Docker image; what are the differences between development and production environments and builds.
You will see how to deal with exceptions, logs, and metrics with real-world use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Anastasiia Tymoshchuk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you document your code? Do you think it is important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you need to get back to your code in 6 month after you wrote it, there is always a big possibility that you will have to spend some time to find out how this code works. Or if someone else wrote some code, which is already in production and your task is to fix a bug in it and there is no documentation and no one actually knows what this code does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more benefits of implementing continuous documentation for the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;easy to onboard new team members,
easy to share knowledge,
if this code is open source - easy to start contributing,
easy to see purpose and motivation of each piece of code,
easy to keep versioning for each new release of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk you will see the difference between documentation types and a demo in the end of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

Anastasiia has been using DDD for a few years and created her own way to design a new architecture for a product, a feature, redesign, refactoring and also for exploring existing products, their ecosystem and their functionality. In this talk attendees will learn on a real-world example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to start with Eventstorming to explore the user journey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to move forward and explore the ecosystem of the product/software/feature/service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to finalise a new architecture with C4 diagrams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite all the attempts to create a new perfect architecture, it could be affected by the team and organisation structure. Conway’s Law says: “Any organisation that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organisation’s communication structure”. Anastasiia experienced this so many times in different teams and organisations, that in the past few years she started applying Team Topologies together with DDD. This worked pretty well and as a bonus Anastasiia will go through the hidden icebergs of this approach as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
