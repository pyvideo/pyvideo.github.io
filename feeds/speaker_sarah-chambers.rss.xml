It’s
not all cat gifs and angry users. There’s real value to be found in
working together with your support team. They are a direct line to your
users!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can definitely be difficult to bridge this gap between disciplines,
but your goals are 100% the same: help the customer do The Thing.
Because support literally spends all day talking to customers, they have
a ton of amazing data about the effectiveness of documentation, and the
tasks customers are trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a better relationship with your support team will help you
build a better relationship with your users. I’ve seen first hand how
coordination drives a well executed user experience all the way from
self service to hands- on support. Work together better and see tangible
results in your user happiness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll show you: · the value of having support and technical
writing aligned · how to break down the silos between teams and work
effectively together · how to access and use the glorious data that
support is already collecting · the metrics that matter for support-led
user assistance&lt;/p&gt;
