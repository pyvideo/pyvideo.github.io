Our core software stack builds upon many of the OSGeo projects including GDAL and Mapserver, as well as the rich ecosystem of Python libraries. Internally we have processed over 5 Petabytes of public and private satellite imagery, including the full data corpus from the Landsat and Copernicus missions. By combining the above open-source tools with a FUSE-based filesystem for cloud storage, we have enabled a scalable compute platform that has demonstrated reading over 200 GB/s of satellite imagery into cloud compute nodes. In particular, we have generated global 15m Landsat-8, 20m Sentinel-1, and 10m Sentinel-2 composites, using over 10,000 CPUs.     We recently created a public open-source python client library that can be used to query and access imagery from within our platform, and made this platform available to researchers for non-commercial projects. In this talk we will describe how researchers can get started on the Descartes Labs Platform, and demonstrate examples in crop yield analysis and land use/land cover classification.&lt;/p&gt;
