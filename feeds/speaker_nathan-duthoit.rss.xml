&lt;p&gt;Audience level: Intermediate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do when you need to cache a model but also need to query the
cached data? You denormalize all the things! In this talk we will see
how to create and maintain denormalized versions of some of your Django
models in order to enjoy the benefits of caching while maintaining the
benefits of relational data. Abstract Denormalized models: another copy
of your data that you can query&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical usage (with examples): pre-computed data a different view of
your data combining multiple model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping things synced The canonical data is always right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must define the authoritative source of data and maintain it. Know
thy parent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of the canonical source (across database shards)
Propagating changes manually (call a method on save) &amp;quot;use the signals
Luke&amp;quot; (example)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handling concurrency issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach: you can't improve what you can't measure. Measure, fix,
measure again, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems and some solutions (applying computer science goodness) one at
a time: locks and mutexes (pylock) ensuring update order is correct&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrations are often applied as part of the deploy process. For most
Django applications, this is fine. However, when your data becomes
large, slow migrations and locked tables can result in downtime. Running
migrations outside of the deploy process helps minimize the impact. This
talk will go over this and other strategies I have found successful in
minimizing downtime during database migrations. Abstract The common
approach and its challenges The first step: running migrations
out-of-band What it means&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code deployed should work both before and after the migration is applied
Step by step examples: adding a new model adding a required field to an
existing model changing an existing field&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges introduced: More process and discipline required when
developing Continuous deployment becomes more challenging&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speeding up schema migrations When running the migration with south is
too slow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A showcase of pt-online-schema-change: how it works, its challenges
Handling long data migrations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with running long data migrations using south: takes too long,
ssh connection could be lost, no measure of progress Options (advantages
and challenges of each): management command in screen background
(celery) tasks: monitoring progress throttling to reduce impact on the
system&lt;/p&gt;
