long various parts of the program executed. Most profilers run inside
your Python process. If you’re inside a Python program you generally
have pretty easy access to its stack, hence we can gather information
about time spent in each level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we’ll build a Python profiler from scratch and so learn
about the dynamic nature of Python and how do well-known profilers such
as cProfile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also learn the difference between a tracing and a sampling
profiler and which one to use in what circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, I’ll provide some insights on that question by surveying the APIs that helped make projects such as Requests, Flask and Celery popular, while also reviewing technical implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
