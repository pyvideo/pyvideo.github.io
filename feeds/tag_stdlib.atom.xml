Together let us explore
the various modules, which will help you to build robust working
programs. Once you know about a particular library well, you will start
replacing those 20 odd lines of code you used to write with a 2-3 lines
and feel safe that your code will now work on all the platforms that
Python supports. Just like the galaxy, the Python Standard Library is
vast and when hitch-hiking I will take you through some important ones
that happen to be used most often. You can explore, ask questions,
experiment through out the ride. Welcome! And let the journey begin.&lt;/p&gt;
