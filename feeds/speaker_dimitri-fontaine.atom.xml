When the backend
should implement user oriented workflows, it may rely on a RDBMS
component to take care of the system's integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL is the world's most advanced open source relational database,
and is very good at taking care of your system's integrity. PostgreSQL
also comes with a ton of data processing power, and in many cases a
simple enough SQL statement may replace hundreds of lines of code
written in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we learn advanced SQL techniques and how to reason about
which part of the backend code should be done in the database, and which
parf of the backend code is so easier to write as a SQL query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All levels.&lt;/p&gt;
