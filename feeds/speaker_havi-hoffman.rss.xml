humans to create, publish and present technical content in a variety of
media. Primarily in text, in the context of a blog or other ‘managed’
calendar-driven web publications. Not technical documentation. Sometimes
it’s a mighty fine line between docs and blogs, but I think we can and
should differentiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore principles and patterns of kind, effective
editorial practice, and nuances of voice, civility, and clear
communication, as they play out when working with a diverse distributed
roster of authors, many of whom are non-native English speakers or
first-time storytellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there’s as much appetite for diversity of voice and point of
view in blogging about software development as there is in speaking
about it at developer conferences. And I’ve got some observations to
share about how we can cultivate that.&lt;/p&gt;
