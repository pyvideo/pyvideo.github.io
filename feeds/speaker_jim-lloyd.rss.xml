The new environment replaced the previous use of Adobe Flash and Actionscript 3.0, and presented an interesting change in workflow. The presentation will reflect on why the choice was made to shift to Python, some of the complications that arose, and the emergence of Python in secondary schools as the language of choice. The presentation is done from the perspective of an all-girls school context.&lt;/p&gt;
