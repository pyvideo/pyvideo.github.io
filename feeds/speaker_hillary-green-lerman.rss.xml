How long should you run it for? How will you know if an observed difference is real? Does it matter what my A/B test is measuring? All of these questions and more can be answered by learning about Hypothesis Testing in SciPy. You might have heard of T-Tests, Chi Squared, and ANOVA in your high school stats class, but you've never heard them explained like this!&lt;/p&gt;

Analysis intensive, we'll learn the basics of hypothesis testing using
SciPy. You’ll practice making mathematically informed decision-making
and experimental design used by marketers, social scientists, product
managers, and data analysts everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

experiences for students. A common implementation provides
individualized follow-up assignments for struggling students. Using
observed data, we show how to use bootstrapping and rejection sampling
to create a valid comparative study of groups of students who do and
don’t use adaptive technology, even when the samples are not
uncorrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
