astronomical researchers. A prominent example is in the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope (LSST), a project which will repeatedly observe the
southern sky 1000 times over the course of 10 years. The 30,000 GB of
raw data created each night will pass through a processing pipeline
consisting of C++ and legacy code, stitched together with a python
interface. This example underscores the need for astronomers to be
well-versed in large-scale statistical analysis techniques in python. We
seek to address this need with the AstroML package, which is designed to
be a repository for well-tested data mining and machine learning
routines, with a focus on applications in astronomy and astrophysics. It
will be released in late 2012 with an associated graduate-level
textbook, 'Statistics, Data Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy'
(Princeton University Press). AstroML leverages many computational tools
already available available in the python universe, including numpy,
scipy, scikit- learn, pymc, healpy, and others, and adds efficient
implementations of several routines more specific to astronomy. A main
feature of the package is the extensive set of practical examples of
astronomical data analysis, all written in python. In this talk, we will
explore the statistical analysis of several interesting astrophysical
datasets using python and astroML.&lt;/p&gt;
