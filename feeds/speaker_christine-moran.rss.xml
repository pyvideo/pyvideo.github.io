Margherita &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will introduce ParaView, an open source application
developed by researchers around the world for parallel visualization and
analysis of large scale datasets, which in can be used to visualize and
analyze terabytes of data in real time. ParaView’s core algorithms are
implemented in C/C++ but all its major functionality can be scripted
from python with ease. I’ll give a short introduction to AstroViz, a
parallel visualization tool for astrophysical simulations implemented as
an opensource plugin to ParaView, which I have been lead developer on
since 2009. The focus of the talk will be on driving ParaView from
within python however, both general out of the box use and customized
extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have access to several parallel supercomputers so if there’s a
huge dataset we as a crowd would like to tackle visualizing during the
course of the week that would be fun project. The end of the talk will
be a short brainstorm of cool applications of analysis and visualization
of large scale datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
