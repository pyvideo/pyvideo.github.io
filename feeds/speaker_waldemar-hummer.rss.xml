&lt;p&gt;[Wicklow Hall 1 on 2022-07-13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the staggering dominance of public cloud providers, dev teams across the globe are increasingly focusing time and energy on optimizing their cloud development and deployment flows. The traditional deploy-and-test cycles against public clouds can become slow and tedious, where developers are often facing several minutes of idle times between deployments that need to be frequently triggered during testing &amp;amp; debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we provide a hands-on introduction to LocalStack (39k+ Github stars), a fully functional local AWS cloud stack. With LocalStack, applications can be developed entirely on your local machine, reducing dev&amp;amp;test cycles from minutes to seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session covers interactive live coding to showcase common scenarios and use cases, different settings for local debugging of Lambdas and containerized apps (e.g., ECS/EKS), as well as some advanced new features that can radically improve productivity and team collaboration patterns.
We will also glance over the large ecosystem of tools that LocalStack natively integrates with - from IaC frameworks like Terraform or Pulumi, to application frameworks like Serverless or Architect, to a whole suite of tools provided by AWS itself (CDK, SAM, Copilot, Chalice, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll wrap up the session with a deep dive into some of the Python internals of LocalStack, which reveals some interesting architectural patterns and hidden gems!&lt;/p&gt;
