&lt;p&gt;I was staring to my screen and there was this — &lt;cite&gt;^(http|https|ftp):[/]{2}([a-zA-Z0-9-.]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})(:[0-9]+)?/?([a-zA-Z0-9-._?,'/\+&amp;amp;amp;%$#=~]*)&lt;/cite&gt;
I could understand that it is, may be, talking about some kind of URL pattern. But what the meaning of it? No answer. And Stackoverflow was no help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This when I started my project to automatically generate the intent of any RegEx expression given the expression itself. Without any prior domain knowledge.
I will walk you through the data I used, how I built my models, and the outcomes achieved.
I will also provide a notebook so you’ll be able to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;
