application in which python is used as the logical controller of an
autonomous 20 foot blimp. The blimp's autopilot features, prolonged air
time, large size, and smooth motion make it the ideal platform for
aerial photography. Giving the blimp an onboard controller reduces the
overall costs and requirements of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;
