When a new vulnerability comes out, the usual questions from the management are : &amp;quot;Are we impacted? If so, how many servers are vulnerable to X?&amp;quot;. During this presentation, we will release &amp;quot;ChopChop&amp;quot;, an internal tool we built aimed at solving problematics around vulnerability detection/regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopchop aims at providing a fully-featured scanner allowing you :
- to easily scan your servers
- integrate new plugins (aka new vulnerability checks) without pain.
- get pragmatic results in term of security&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created this tool back in 2017 at Michelin integrating popular checks (eg. non-interpreted .htpasswd, .git folder accessible in the webroot, wildcard in crossdomain.xml, ...) and is now, one of our go-to tool, also integrated inside our CI/CD pipeline in order to tackle security in its whole.&lt;/p&gt;
