While thinking about how to properly separate the management and flexible deployment of services that grow properly on a monolithic server, I became interested in Pantsbuild after watching the Multiple Django Services in a single repo video at DjangoCon Euro 2021. I would like to share my experiences and concerns that I had while setting up a plugin that provides a unified way to manage code, applying mypy type hints, and deploying pex (a Python executable build file) to docker with simple boilerplate code.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently developing retail-related server applications as a backend engineer at fintech startup Payhere. I like things that are automated and efficient rather than cumbersome. I will not stop challenging myself even if it is slow.&lt;/p&gt;
