only one - obvious way to do something. However, when it comes to
interoperation with C and C++, there is a multitude of options: the
Python C API, Boost.Python, ctypes, cffi, Cython. I will describe my
quest to find the &lt;strong&gt;holy grail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;W&lt;/sup&gt;W &lt;strong&gt;right interface&lt;/strong&gt; for a
high-performance networking library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is largely a case study in applying Boost.Python, and will look
at some issues such as the Global Interpreter Lock, handling
KeyboardInterrupt cleanly, and managing object lifetime. I will briefly
mention some of the alternative tools to explain why I settled on
Boost.Python. It is not a complete Boost.Python tutorial, but rather
aims to give a sense of the flavour and show how it's used in a real
application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For obvious reasons, this talk will have a lot of C++ code in it, and
some familiarity with C++ will be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

programs are compiled and executed, with special attention towards
just-in-time compilation done by PyPy. PyPy is the most advanced Python
interpreter around, and while it should generally just speed up your
programs, there is a wide range of performance that you can get out of
PyPy, ranging from slightly faster than CPython to C speeds, depending
on how you write your programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will split the talk in two parts. In the first part we will explain
how things work, and what can and cannot be optimized, as well as
describe the basic heuristics of the JIT compiler and optimizer. In the
next part we will do a brief survey of existing tools for looking at
performance of Python programs, with a specific focus on PyPy. We'll
mostly focus on vmprof with a brief mention of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this talk, an audience member should be better equipped
with the tools to write new software and improve existing software with
performance in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

Kivy. From exhibition-size interactive displays to race car telemetry
systems to robotics, Kivy is being used to deliver many compelling and
innovative applications. We'll use these applications to discuss some of
the features and abilities of the framework that make it such a good
choice for a wide range of uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll briefly cover some exciting projects using Kivy, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project Liatris: a new, open source project using Kivy touch devices
to control robots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RaceCapture Pro: A race car telemetry system that uses Kivy
interactive displays both in-car and in post-session analytics
interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brain Trainer Plus: A mental dexterity trainer deployed to old age
homes and medical treatment facilities that has been shown effective
in treating dementia and other mental disorders, as well as bringing
a greatly enhanced quality-of-life to the aged and mentally ill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CAMI Educational products: The rich feature set and effortless
animation abilities of Kivy make developing compelling, responsive
desktop and mobile interactions easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Icarus touch and Touch live projects: creating radically new and
exciting interactive musical instruments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these applications are being delivered using Kivy, a free, open
source, full stack, multi-touch, cross-platform Python/Cython framework
that runs on a watch. I kid you not.&lt;/p&gt;

army of robot monkeys at your disposal. Why should humans have to worry
about finding the particular combination of Turkish and Tengwar that
crashes the serialiser, or the convoluted sequence of operations that
corrupts the database?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
Hypothesis is a Python library for turning unit tests into generative tests,
covering a far wider range of cases than you can manually. Rather than just
testing for the things you already know about, Hypothesis goes out and
actively hunts for bugs in your code. It usually finds them, and when it
does it gives you simple and easy to read examples to demonstrate.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;&amp;mdash;Hypothesis 1.0 release announcement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property-based testing lets you think about your tests in terms of
general behaviour and invariant properties instead of getting lost in
the details of individual examples, and good tools (such as Hypothesis)
will explore quite complex combinations of test data and reduce them to
minimum failing cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide a practical introduction to property-based
testing with Hypothesis, and show how you can use it to build more
effective test suites with less effort.&lt;/p&gt;

significantly from the early Python 3 days of just 2to3. Porting Python
2 code to work with Python 2 &amp;amp; 3 without a constant 2to3 translation
step is not hard anymore, and leads to much easier-to-maintain ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will discuss some of the suggested best practices for
supporting both Python 2 and Python 3. We will cover some of the tools
for detecting potential issues, such as pylint, the available options,
such as six, futurize and modernize, to simplify the process of updating
the code and spend some time discussing what parts of porting still
require care and attention, such as the text / binary data division.&lt;/p&gt;

we get changes out as fast as possible? And what happens to requests
during a deploy? If you want continuous deployment, you have to solve
these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you handle configuration, so that the same code can run in

implemented by a specific language. However, understanding the theory
underlying OO is not quite the same as understanding how OO concepts are
supported by a particular language. It is insightful to understand the
simple OO fundamentals and how these map to the particular
implementation provided by Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will first explain the very basics of OO from a
language-neutral point of view with the aim of showing what OO can offer
you. I will touch upon the simple mathematical theory underlying OO and
how it can be used as a mental discipline to improve your natural
capacity to reason about programs. I hope to give you enough information
to help you distinguish between better and worse designs and to detect
whether you're using OO as it was intended. I will show how these
fundamentals map to Python, and compare the difference of Python's
implementation to that of some other languages (even functional
languages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for anyone: whether you're new at Object Orientation, or a
practitioner wondering whether OO is worth the effort you've spent
trying to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

high-performance applications for performing simulations of chemical

between tools, such as format conversions, which may be simple for a
programmer to automate, but require hours of tedious work for a
researcher without programming experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will present a specific example of an application which
fills such a gap in a medical research laboratory, where readings of
chemical samples are used to measure the response of TB-causing bacteria
to various drugs. The readings must be converted from the raw format
produced by the instrument in the laboratory into a format suitable for
uploading into an online tool for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

misapplication resulting in a slow relegation to the realm of academia
and slightly dubious research. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In
August 2015 we released OpenCanary, the Open Source version of our
commercial Python-based honeypot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional honeypots aim to reveal attacker tools, techniques and
procedures, by entrapping attackers through emulation (or
instrumentation) of common protocols and services. They are typically
installed standalone, and seldom updated. We argue that this honeypot
approach is outdated; current organisations struggle far more with
identifying breaches than identifying the version of some generic
rootkit installed post-breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenCanary changes that, treating the honeypot as an internal
distributed sensor rather than a standalone alert generator. Each event
reported is a high-quality indicator of investigation-worthy activity,
and each OpenCanary instance feeds event data to a correlator which
produces single alerts even in the face of network-wide scans. With such
a high signal-to-noise ratio, every alert requires investigation. This
is in contrast to the stream of alerts produced by tools such as
anti-virus, network IDS or traditional honeypots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenCanary wound up relying on Python for the majority of the code. The
Python eco-system provided support that sped up development and, more
importantly, deployment. However it didn’t take us the full distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we provide a brief background on honeypots, discuss the
design of OpenCanary, delve into the challenges experienced and our
plans for the project. Along the way, we’ll demo the trivially
installable OpenCanary, configure a few fake services and provide an
outsider’s view of developing in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

that uses Python and open data to promote informed decision making to
drive social change. We use our skills for social good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We build tools like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://living-wage.co.za/"&gt;Living Wage&lt;/a&gt; for
calculating fair wages for domestic workers,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wazimap.co.za"&gt;Wazimap.co.za&lt;/a&gt; for exploring your
neighbourhood through statistics, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mpr.code4sa.org"&gt;Medicine Prices
(mpr.code4sa.org)&lt;/a&gt; for finding cheaper
generics of prescription medicines,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openbylaws.org.za"&gt;OpenByLaws.org.za&lt;/a&gt; for local legislation
that's easy to read and share, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pmg.org.za"&gt;PMG.org.za&lt;/a&gt;
for keeping an eye on Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll discuss what civic technology means, how you can get
involved, and the why, what and how of our approach to building and
running more than 25 websites, services and applications with a small
budget and an even smaller team.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it's
protecting large customers from 160Gbps DDOS attacks, dealing with
normal Reddit traffic, Universal SSL or providing one of the fastest DNS
servers in the world we need to stay up, work fast and deploy fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end we have two large Python projects we use at CloudFlare. One
is the popular configuration manager Salt. We provide patches, features
and bug reports on regular intervals to the Salt project. The other is
an internal tool called CFSetup. CFSetup allows us to do the following
with a few simple commands: spin up Docker containers that reflect
machines in production, spin up a tightly coupled stack of Docker
containers that reflect our software and hardware stacks, run build
environments inside of well defined Docker containers to ensure that the
compiled end-product was built using the same libraries that are on the
production machines, and various other utility features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover how Salt works, how we've extended it to scale up
and how we've had to debug it. It also cover how we've managed to build
a layer on top of Docker to make it easier to use for ad-hoc testing and
developing and what it's like interacting with Docker using Python.&lt;/p&gt;

split-apply-combine pattern, where you break up a big dataset into
independent pieces, operate on each piece in isolation and then put all
the pieces back together. This crops up in all stages of a data
analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During data preparation, when performing group-wise ranking,
standardisation, or normalisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During modelling, when fitting separate models to each group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During communication, when creating summaries or visualisations for
display or analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python has many tools that make it easy to utilise this strategy when
solving data science problems. These range from list and dictionary
comprehensions in the language, the &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;reduce&lt;/em&gt; functions and
&lt;em&gt;itertools&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;functools&lt;/em&gt; modules in the standard library to dedicated
packages like &lt;em&gt;Pandas&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PyToolz&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Blaze&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dask&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explicit recognition of the applicability of the pattern allows one to
reuse standard components for the bookkeeping code that handles the
splitting and combining of the independent pieces. This allows one to
concentrate on the data analysis code that is unique to the problem at
hand. Since implicit in the pattern is the independence of the pieces,
its applicability immediately implies a strategy for parallelisation
which allows one to easily scale one's solution from single core to
out-of-core computation on multiple machines, often with only very few
changes to the code required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce the pattern and how to recognise it by
presenting some common code blocks. We will then look at some of the
tools available, in particular &lt;em&gt;Pandas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PyToolz&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrate their
use, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Finally we'll show how
to take a simple analysis and parallelise it to process a dataset that
is too large to fit in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
