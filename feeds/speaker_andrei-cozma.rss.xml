It also covers 3D image processing and visualization tools available in Python and the flow of creating Python based AI machine vision applications and deploying those on real hardware. The Talk is targeted to system engineers, vision algorithms developers and software engineers looking to boost their knowledge in developing Python based machine vision applications coupled with depth sensing cameras and high-performance embedded processing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
