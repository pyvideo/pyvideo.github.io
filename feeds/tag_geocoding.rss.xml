While searching for things &amp;quot;In Your Area&amp;quot; may be a solution, some topics (like where you want to go to college) can be a little more nuanced. In this talk shows how I use Elasticsearch's accuracy and Google Places API to show college options in a requested area. The example project is a college search app that gives you the ability to look for schools based on an area and indicators like acceptance rates and expected student load debt. I'll show how to perform Places autocorrect query and then use the returned information to curate search results within Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;
