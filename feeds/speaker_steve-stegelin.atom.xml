features and helping confirm the context of content to simply breaking
up walls of text. However, screenshots can carry a lot of overhead,
including localization considerations and short shelf-lives due to
continuous deployment, which may make them more effort than their worth.
For content that appears in context of the UI, screenshots can also be
redundant and unnecessary. As alternatives to screenshots, there are
several visual content strategies to consider to engage audiences and
convey and complement concepts and UIisms, including infographics,
illustrations, and abstract &amp;quot;simplified UI (SUI)&amp;quot; representations. Which
you use depends on your intent and message.&lt;/p&gt;
