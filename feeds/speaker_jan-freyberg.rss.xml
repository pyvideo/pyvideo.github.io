In many businesses, this means that a lot of time, energy or money goes into acquiring labels. Active learning is a technique to make this process more efficient, by choosing data points to label based on current model performance. Here, I discuss methods of doing so easily and quickly in the interactive python ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
