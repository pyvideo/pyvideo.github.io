In 2014, as the new documentation coordinator my challenges were: 1. Create a living knowledge base that people want to use 2. Switch from just-in-case documentation to just-in-time documentation
In order to start churning out content, I designed a workflow process called Just-­In-­Time (JIT) documentation. Just In Time is actually a production strategy that is used primarily in manufacturing, to cost-­effectively manage inventory supply. Some say that the approach originated in Japan, others credit Henry Ford. As we applied it to documentation, just-­in-­time means that we create the just enough documentation, just in time. This presentation covers how we created this process, how we’ve refined it and its success.&lt;/p&gt;
