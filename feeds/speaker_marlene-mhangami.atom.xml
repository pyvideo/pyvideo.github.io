&lt;p&gt;[Liffey Hall 1 on 2022-07-13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I was working on setting up a relational database to explore records from DataSF’s Civic Art Collection. Whenever I attend a tech conference I try to spend a day or two in the city to check out its cultural scene, so this seemed like useful information! I decided to use MySQL as my database engine. Coming from a Pandas background I was surprised by how unproductive and restricted I felt writing raw SQL queries. I also spent a significant amount of time resolving errors in queries that worked with one flavor of SQL but failed with MySQL. Throughout the process, I kept thinking to myself if only there was a more Pythonic way!!! A few weeks later I was introduced to Ibis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in Zimbabwe and the first thing that pops into my mind when I think of the word ibis is a safari. One of my favorite things to do when I'm not working is to go on a game drive. Whenever I've been adventuring on safari I usually see ibises perched on top of an elephant. The contrast between the creatures is stark! The African Sacred Ibis is a small, elegant creature that's named after the ancient Egyptian god Thoth. While as many of us know, an elephant is a very big and complex animal. This image serves as a great metaphor for the Python package and how it interacts with big database engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibis allows you to write intuitive Python code and have that code be translated into SQL. Whether you’re wanting to interact with SQL databases or wanting to use distributed DBMSs, Ibis lets you do this in Python. You can think of the python code as the less complex elegant layer sitting on top of any big data engine of your choice. At the moment, Ibis supports quite a few backends including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional DBMSs: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite Analytical DBMSs: OmniSciDB, ClickHouse, Datafusion Distributed DBMSs: Impala, PySpark, BigQuery In memory analytics: pandas and Dask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything you can write in an SQL select statement you can write in Ibis. You can carry out joins, filters, and other operations on your data in a familiar, Pandas-like syntax. In this talk, we'll go through several examples of these and compare what the SQL code would look like versus writing to the database with Ibis. Overall, using Ibis simplifies your workflows, makes you more productive, and keeps your code readable.&lt;/p&gt;

organization and Python developers in the Harare software development
community to advance the cause of women in technology in Zimbabwe. The
program operates in community centers, universities, high schools and
tech hubs to make programming accessible to girls regardless of their
socio-economic status. Upon initially joining a ZimboPy club, many of
the girls would have never used a computer before, let alone code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zimbabwe, only 17% of computer science undergraduate majors are
women, and in the developing world, women make up less than 20% of the
information and technology workforce. ZimboPy exists to empower
Zimbabwean girls with the skills and confidence necessary to not only
enter the local tech industry, but to lead it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to learning to code, ZimboPy club members also join a global
network of women in technology that are working to tackle social
challenges through human-centered design and computer science. ZimboPy’s
mentorship program invites experienced women developers, mainly from the
United States and Europe, to help Zimbabwean girls address local
problems which can be solved with technology, such as clean water and
e-commerce solutions for small shops in towns and villages. Mentors will
travel to Zimbabwe and work with girls as they develop a plan for their
applications and pair-program with them, answering questions and
providing feedback along the way. To ensure that the girls are
successful, mentors will continue to work with their groups even after
leaving the country through weekly video conferences and email feedback.
Overall, ZimboPy looks forward to changing Zimbabwe’s future through
creativity, collaboration and the power of Python programming.&lt;/p&gt;
