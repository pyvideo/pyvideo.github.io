variance in applications varying from finance to the environment to
personal sensors. But what do you do when you have hundreds or thousands
of time series?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter time series clustering. In this talk, Susan Devitt, Senior Data
Scientist, will introduce two algorithms for time series clustering -
Shape Based Distance and Dynamical Time Warp - implemented in the python
package dtwclust. Taking a real world example using daily financial
transaction data, she will show you when to consider clustering and how
it can be used for anomaly detection.&lt;/p&gt;
