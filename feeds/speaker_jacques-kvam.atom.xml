&lt;p&gt;Abstract
Creating useful visualizations is an important skill for data scientists. They allow us to gain new insights into our data. Dashboards are powerful tools for creating complex and interactive visualizations. You can explore data in ways static charts cannot. Bowtie is a Python library that makes it easy to create dashboards. This talk will introduce Bowtie and focus on creating dashboards and interesting features. I will also discuss deploying them, the tech stack, and future work and goals.&lt;/p&gt;
