With its ever growing user base and popularity, comes the need for making sure the PyPI ecosystem is secure for all users all without constraining ease of use. Part pep talk (pun intended!), part presentation, this talk plans to discuss some of the challenges that were tackled in terms of bringing the various PyPI support backlogs current in both account recovery and PEP 541 as well as other support requests. This talk will also discuss process improvements made, lessons learned, and what’s in store in the future for PyPI support.&lt;/p&gt;
