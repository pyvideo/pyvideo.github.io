&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the broadest sense, this talk is on how to read code. More than this,
it is a series of methods and practices which one can follow to get up
to speed on a new codebase. The subject of this talk will be
open-sourced Django projects, but many of the experiences which fuel
this talk will be based on joining a new team. It will cover tracing
execution paths, finding the more interesting portions of a codebase, as
well as how to address any issues you may have found in it.&lt;/p&gt;

thinking about and developing regex statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working with UNIX for decades now and, although i always
managed to avoid Perl, i have been intrigued with Regex constructs ever
since my first encounter. These weird unreadable things that can
transform text like nothing else or can find what i’m looking for in
massive files, in no time at all. I’ve created regexes that only appeal
to the most nerdiest of nerds and i’ve stunned colleagues by fixing
their futile regex attempts in just a few keystrokes. But when Damian
Conway showed me how regexes really work i was awestruck. And now i want
to share this knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at pythonistas that have some experience with the re
module. I will take some easy examples and explain in plain english how
a regex engine searches for a match. This will show that a regex is not
some mysterious incomprehensible pattern description or declarative
blueprint. Instead it is a small program that is very good at comparing
single characters. Like any programming language it turns out that once
you understand the rules and structure it suddenly becomes so much
easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this new found knowledge we will up the ante and try some more
difficult stuff, adding other semantics and some tips and tricks. We’ll
look at some pitfalls, maybe compare regex to python solutions and have
a look at some regexes found in the wild (either on my drive or on
github).&lt;/p&gt;

This is also the key to easier programming and better maintainability.
Clean code is much easier to debug, and it's much harder to introduce
a bug in such code.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When you think about code review, you probably think about verifying
and examining the code. Reviewing the expert's code may look like a
waste of time because he knows what he's doing. Reviewing the code by
a beginner may look like a waste of time because he's not able to find
as many defects as an experienced developer. Code review is a code
quality tool in the first place, but it's also much beyond that. You
can teach or help someone, learn from somebody and much more both from
the position of reviewer and reviewee.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;There is much more about the real power of code review which I want to
share with you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk is also about how to do it the right way and how to not do
it based on lessons learned and my experience within the diverse teams
of people with a variety of knowledge and experience. I was reviewing
the code but, on the other hand, I was also being reviewed. I'd like
to pass my observations to people who are reviewing the code both in
commercial and open source projects for a while. This talk is also for
those who want to start to review the code, but they do not know how
to do it.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cython [1] has a very long history of faithfully helping users to solve
their Python performance problems and integrating native code into
Python in production critical settings, while stimulating somewhat less
confidence with its 0.x versioning scheme. For the next Cython version,
a stable 3.0 release, we are planning to clean up several historically
grown issues in the language to make the Cython compiler more friendly
for modern Python users to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will show how Cython can be used for compiling and
speeding up Python code, using fast native data structures and
libraries. I will then give an overview of the changes that are on their
way for the 3.0 release and how they will affect the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

higher level of abstraction, applying the same treatment to functions
and classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what can you actually do with them? For many Python developers I've
encountered, decorators sometimes appear to be a solution looking for a
problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll show you some practical uses for decorators, and how
you can use them to make your code more readable and maintainable, while
also providing more semantic power. Moreover, you'll see examples of
things would be hard to do without decorators. I hope that after this
talk, you'll have a good sense of how to use decorators in your own
Python projects.&lt;/p&gt;

Billionaires.On mass they are clamoring to master the skill of Computer
pRogramming. We describe a successful working model for the teaching of
Computer pRogamming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Science is now regarded as one of the leading disciplines in
the 21st century. Computers are ubiquitous and prevalent in most, if not
all, sectors of our modern society – applications include using them in
weather forecasting, robotic surgery, space exploration, e-commerce,
smart cities, driverless cars, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, coding or computer programming is now regarded by many as an
essential skill for the young person, and it has been dubbed the ‘4th’
R’ (computer pRogramming) along with Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recognition of the new status of computer programming, governments
worldwide have launched initiatives to have it taught in schools from
Kindergarten through to junior school and all the way through secondary
school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the question emerges is how do we best teach and motivate the next
generation in acquiring this skill? Given the fact that this field is
very much in its infancy, there are insufficient number of skilled
Computer Science teachers and very little pedagogy to guide the
educator. Therefore, the whole world is learning how best to teach this
subject by trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will describe a case study whereby coding/computer programming,
in the form of Python programming, was introduced to a group of 110
young people from the ages of 11 to 18 (Years 7-13 in a U.K secondary
school). The talk will include descriptions of the various teaching
methodologies introduced to the young people for this purpose and the
outcomes; the talk will also address various challenges and questions
about how to teach coding to young people. The talk will conclude with
helpful suggestions, based on the findings of the case study, on how to
proceed with the teaching of computer programming to these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet has never failed at being, among other things, a giant treasure of unsolicited advice by random people on all sorts of things, programming being no exception. Wanna become a better coder? Learn to maximize your WPM (c). Never look at documentation because that's just embarrassing. And for crying out loud, change your screen background to black!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you are, a fairly okay programmer, looking for ways to become better at coding. How do you achieve that? Well I'm no 10x engineer myself (thank goodness), but I do believe that there's a handful of things we can safely rule out.&lt;/p&gt;

Starting from the 70s, the world is full of relational databases and SQL was the way to make queries. However, SQL is valuable to an injection attack. Lots of efforts are being used to stop those attacks and it made workflow become less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t want to make the same mistake. That’s why using a Python query language is good. Having the Python community in our mind, we created WOQLpy, an open-source query language that lets users build queries in Python, instead of JSON-LD which is the native query language for our TerminusDB database. Now users can store data with a knowledge graph and make graph data visualization with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the talk, we will talk about what challenges we have when creating a query language in Python, the method we use, the idea and theory behind, and how WOQLpy work. This part will include a quick live demo of using WOQLpy so audiences can have an impression on how to make a query and get the task done, that is, getting a meaningful graph visualization form the source CSVs. The process of how to create a database and schema, loading the data form many CSVs, making a query and visualization, will be demonstrated using just one python script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second part of the talk, we want to stimulate a discussion of what is a good design in Python and what is not. This part will be more interactive with the audiences, as we want to hear from you all, what would be the best for Pythonistas. By first suggesting some possible design, we will use a live voting system to gather opinions. This part of the talk will extend to the Q &amp;amp; A sessions to allow further discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is for Pythonista at all levels who are interested in starting to design a package in Python, no matter if the audience has published a python library or not. By attending this talk, audiences will learn about how to design a Python package that will be useful to Pythonistas and hopefully encourage more people to publish open-source packages online.&lt;/p&gt;

In my talk I'll tell you about my approach to deleting unneeded code, tools that could help you and how did it turned out in the end in real world projects.
As you probably know, detecting unused code automatically is a hard task and doing it in Python is exceptionally hard because we sometimes call methods with getattr or write classes which are only used in non-python configuration files. Tools give us only a partial success. What you could do beyond them? What approach to take? I'd like to discuss it in detail in my talk.&lt;/p&gt;

richtet sich in erster Linie an Softwareentwickler oder Betreuer von
großen Buildumgebungen, die nach Alternativen zu herkömmlichen Tools,

&lt;p&gt;SCons ist ein Buildsystem das vollständig in Python programmiert wird.
Die Eingabedateien zur Definition der einzelnen Buildschritte werden
ebenfalls als Pythonskripte ausgeführt. Durch diese Kombination einer
DSL (Domain Specific Language) mit der Allzwecksprache Python, lassen
sich auch komplizierte Softwareprojekte einfach spezifizieren und bauen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das Framework das sich hinter dem Startskript verbirgt, ist auf einfache
Erweiterbarkeit und hohe Flexibilität ausgelegt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Während des Vortrags soll gezeigt werden wie man ein Projekt richtig
anfängt und make-typische Denkweisen vermeidet. Die Vorteile von SCons
und Standardfragen, z.B. zur Erweiterung des Systems für neue
Buildschritte, werden diskutiert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am Ende soll der Zuhörer einen Eindruck von der Arbeitsweise des
Programms erhalten haben, und entscheiden können ob sich der Einsatz von
SCons für sein Softwareprojekt lohnen würde.&lt;/p&gt;

your Python code? Are you using a GUI toolkit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk gives you the background to use concurrency in your code
without shooting yourself in the foot - which is quite easy if you don't
understand how concurrent execution differs from linear execution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation starts with explaining some concepts like concurrency,
parallelism, resources, atomic operations, race conditions and
deadlocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we discuss the commonly-used approaches to concurrency:
multithreading with the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;threading&lt;/tt&gt; module, multiprocessing with the
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/tt&gt; module, and event loops (which include the
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;asyncio&lt;/tt&gt; framework). Each of these approaches has its typical use
cases, which are explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can implement concurrency on a number of abstraction levels. The
lowest level consists of primitives like locks, events, semaphores and
so on. A higher abstraction level is using queues, typically with worker
threads or processes. Even higher abstraction levels are active objects
(hiding primitives or queues behind an API; this includes &amp;quot;actors&amp;quot; if
you heard of them), the thread and process pools in
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;concurrent.futures&lt;/tt&gt; and the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;asyncio&lt;/tt&gt; framework. Finally, you can
&amp;quot;outsource&amp;quot; concurrency by leaving it to a message broker, which is a
distinct process that receives and distributes messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk closes with some tips and best practices, mainly:&lt;/p&gt;

Being accessed via web browser they allow scientists to easily structure
their work by combining code and documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet notebooks often lead to isolated and disposable analysis artefacts.
Keeping the computation inside those notebooks does not allow for
convenient concurrent model training, model exposure or scheduled model
retraining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those issues can be addressed by taking advantage of recent developments
in the discipline of software engineering. Over the past years
containerization became the technology of choice for crafting and
deploying applications. Building a data science platform that allows for
easy access (via notebooks), flexibility and reproducibility (via
containerization) combines the best of both worlds and addresses Data
Scientist's hidden needs.&lt;/p&gt;

Spark, SQL, and Data Lakes often creates more fog than clarity. However,
clarity about the underlying technologies is crucial to designing the
best technical solution in any field relying on huge amounts of data
including data science, machine learning, but also more traditional
analytical systems such as data integration, data warehousing,
reporting, and OLAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my presentation, I will show that often at least three dimensions are
cluttered and confused in discussions when it comes to data management:
First, buzzwords (labels &amp;amp; terms like &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;AI&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;data lake&amp;quot;);
second, data design patterns (principles &amp;amp; best practices like:
selection push-down, materialization, indexing); and Third, software
platforms (concrete implementations &amp;amp; frameworks like: Python, DBMS,
Spark, and NoSQL-systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only by keeping these three dimensions apart, it is possible to create
technically-sound architectures in the field of big data analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show concrete examples, which through a simple redesign and wise
choice of the right tools and technologies, run thereby up to 1000 times
faster. This in turn triggers tremendous savings in terms of development
time, hardware costs, and maintenance effort.&lt;/p&gt;

simulation (implemented in C++ and Tk/Tcl) accessible through a Python
interface, and through the Jupyter Notebook. The talk describes the
motivation and current status of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more detail, the computer simulation in question is the Object
Oriented Micromagnetic Modelling Framework
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://math.nist.gov/oommf/"&gt;OOMMF&lt;/a&gt;) which is likely the most
widely used micromagnetic simulation package. It can be driven through a
graphical (Tk) user interface or through a configuration file that
defines a simulation run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we first show a Python interface to OOMMF that allows the
driving of OOMMF simulations from a Python program or interpreter
prompt. This way we embed a widely used scientific code from 1990s in a
general purpose programming language
[&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4977225"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] and enable the full use of
the ecosystem of scientific libraries available for Python. For example,
design optimisation, specialised post-processing, and the creation of
figures can all be carried out using a single script; making the work
more easily reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we integrate the Python interface to OOMMF into a Jupyter
notebook, so that all existing benefits of using Jupyter are inherited
for the use in computational micromagnetics, which is the reason we
named our code Jupyter- OOMMF (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://joommf.github.io/"&gt;JOOMMF&lt;/a&gt;). A
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tryjoommf.soton.ac.uk/"&gt;JupyterHub installation&lt;/a&gt; of the tool
reduces barriers in uptake, and all the code is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joommf"&gt;on
github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discuss the benefits of driving computer simulation and data analysis
through Jupyter Notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is a part of the Jupyter-OOMMF (JOOMMF) activity in the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opendreamkit.org/"&gt;OpenDreamKit&lt;/a&gt; project and we acknowledge
financial support from Horizon 2020 European Research Infrastructures
project (676541). The work is also supported by the EPSRC CDT in Next
Generation Computational Modelling EP/L015382/1, and the EPSRC grants
EP/M022668/1 and EP/N032128/1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For additional context: micromagnetic modelling is a key research method
in academia and industry to support development of high-capacity
magnetic storage devices that are cheap, fast, and reliable, and to
enable research into future alternative storage and processing
technologies such as spintronics. The OOMMF modelling package has been
used in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://math.nist.gov/oommf/oommf_cites.html"&gt;over 2500
publications&lt;/a&gt; since
1999.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m part of the team that runs a huge infrastructure for the SAP HANA
development. This infrastructure is vital for nearly all development &amp;amp;
testing activities of SAP HANA. As this infrastructure is powered by
multiple in-house developed applications, we immediately want to know if
an application starts to fail and we need to be able to quickly diagnose
what caused the failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will give you an overview how we monitor our full stack from
the 2000 physical machines up to the 10,000 parallel running Python
application processes, micro-service instances and batch processing
jobs. It includes a review about the used tools, bad and good examples
of instrumentation in Python code, the resulting visualisation and an
outlook on upcoming improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

teachers gave me at first a broad overview of computer history. Then,
they explained me some basic design patterns. And to finish, I often had
to write more or less basic programs, to validate and demonstrate my
skills. Not the kind of code I would be really proud of today: the
procrastinator monkey living in my head at this time was more thinking
about planning my summer holidays, rather than writing Ninja code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to make things worse, my studies focused on network and system
engineering. Not software architecture. Funny story, because I decided
to become programmer a couple of years later…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I realize now is that I don’t have as much time as before to learn.
And in a world driven by business, where time is money, and where
tradeoffs are the rule, there is rarely enough money to write both shiny
new features and a complete test suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who practice Test-Driven Development know how complicated it can
be to write proper tests. TDD is often discouraging at first: the
learning curve is steep. But this problem also exists in the testing
world in general. Because writing good tests is hard, many beginners get
headaches trying to reach this goal. How to convince project managers to
have more time for writing tests in these conditions…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But “le jeu en vaut la chandelle” as we say in French (&amp;quot;the juice is
worth the squeeze&amp;quot;). Well tested applications are not only easier to
maintain and extend. They also have in general a better API. That’s what
we will see in this talk, by focusing on how to write integration tests.
Our journey will begin with a presentation of different testing
strategies. We will then jump to the practical part, using Pytest,
interface testing , dependency injections and stubs, amongst many
others. And because we want to add nice buzzwords on our resume after
PyConDE, we will finish this talk by automating the whole with Docker
Compose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this project, we learned a lot about Test Driven
Development of Python apps in teams and DevOps in the IoT space. We
would now like to share our experience developing a Python application
for a headless IoT device and the things we would liked to have known
upfront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortran is a computer language for scientific programming that is
tailored for efficient run-time execution on a wide variety of
processors. Even if the &lt;em&gt;2003&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;2008&lt;/em&gt; standards added major
improvements like &lt;em&gt;OOP, Coarrays, Submodules, do concurrent&lt;/em&gt; , etc ...
they are not covered by all available compilers. Moreover, the Fortran
developer still suffers from the lack of &lt;strong&gt;meta-programming&lt;/strong&gt; compared
to &lt;strong&gt;C++&lt;/strong&gt; ones. Therefore, it is more and more difficult for applied
mathematicians and computational physicists to write applications at the
&lt;em&gt;state of art&lt;/em&gt; (targeting CPUs, GPUs, MICs) while implementing
complicated algorithms or numerical schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pyccel can be used in two cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve the second point, we developed an internal DSL for
&lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;macros&lt;/em&gt;. The later is used to map sentences based on
&lt;em&gt;mpi4py&lt;/em&gt; , &lt;em&gt;scipy.linalg.blas or lapack&lt;/em&gt; onto the appropriate calls in
Fortran. Moreover, two parsers, for &lt;em&gt;OpenMP&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;OpenACC&lt;/em&gt; , were added
too, allowing for explicit parallelism through the use of pragmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Pyccel is an extension of &lt;strong&gt;Sympy&lt;/strong&gt;. Actually, it
converts a Python code to symbolic expressions/trees, from a Full Syntax
Tree ( &lt;em&gt;RedBaron&lt;/em&gt; ), then annotates the new AST using types or different
settings provided by the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, after a brief description of Pyccel, I will show different
applications including Finite Elements (1d, 2d, 3d), Semi-Lagrangian
schemes (4d), Kronecker linear solvers, diagnostics for 5D kinetic
simulations and Machine Learning for Partial Differential Equations.&lt;/p&gt;

features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to create a package layout that can support a CLI interface, an
importable library, and a GUI all while sharing as much code as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although text and graphical interfaces are very different we can provide
a consistent API with careful consideration. This way users can easily
use our library or either interface without starting all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we will layout a single-file CLI script using argparse similar to
the Unix &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;wc&lt;/tt&gt; tool that takes a text file and outputs the following
information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;__name__ == __main__&lt;/tt&gt; Python idiom, separating the
argument parsing from the main function, and why keeping as little as
possible in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;__main__&lt;/tt&gt; is better for reusability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several pros and cons to providing others with a single-file
script. It's easy to develop and simple to read, but it requires any
user to have the correct version of Python installed. It's also
difficult for other developers to reuse the code in their own projects
or deploy to PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we'll take our single-file script and expand it into a basic Python
package using a main folder, &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;.py, and a cli.py script to expose
the same CLI as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss how to restructure the main and parsing functions from
step 1 into an public API defined by the &lt;strong&gt;init&lt;/strong&gt;.py that exposes the
same CLI functionality as a library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won't dive into setup.py at all, but there will be links and a brief
description on the various tools to layout a package such as
cookiecutter and setup.py.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey"&gt;Gooey&lt;/a&gt; project can easily
expose a CLI as GUI with a few decorators. We'll discuss briefly how to
use Gooey and some of the extra functionality it provides to create more
advanced GUIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also give a simple mental model for how it maps argparse argument
types to GUI widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until step 3 all we required of users was a working Python 3
installation. However, adding Gooey requires users to have a working
Python installer, the Gooey library, and wxPython. Typically GUIs are
meant for higher-level users so asking them to install all of this to
benefit from our little app is too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead we'll see how we run PyInstaller on our entry script to package
up all our dependencies &lt;strong&gt;including&lt;/strong&gt; Python itself into a simple
executable. We'll briefly discuss the build and dist output folders from
PyInstaller along with the ability to use it to package all sorts of
complicated Python applications using Qt, Numpy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End-users in management don't even have to know we used Python!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried to define and process complex workflows for data

&lt;p&gt;Selinon enhances Celery task flow management and allows you to create
and model task flows in your distributed environment that can
dynamically change behavior based on computed results in your cluster,
automatically resolve tasks that need to be executed in case of
selective task runs, automatic tracing mechanism and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

source or commercial - employs one form of software testing or another.
But what are the different kinds of tests in our tool boxes? And how are
they best used? In this talk we'll take a look around and try to answer
these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we'll examine the basic concepts of testing: Everyone has
probably at least heard about &lt;em&gt;unit tests&lt;/em&gt; , but are they all you need?
&lt;em&gt;Performance tests&lt;/em&gt; can help you find out how well your product performs
under load and detect bottle necks early on. &lt;em&gt;Manual testing&lt;/em&gt; is often
looked down upon, since it's not automated, but is it always a bad idea?
And what even &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;mutation testing&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also get to know a lot of the amazing testing tools from the
Python ecosystem. Find out what the best test runner is (Spoiler alert:
it's pytest). Learn how to make writing test more fun and less work
using tools like mock, Faker and factory_boy. Measure the quality of
your test suite using coverage.py.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no tool is the right one for any situation. We'll also talk about
when and how to use each of the tools, while debunking common
misconceptions and demonstrating best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

country has a good response for public pressure across the internet, and
this response is even better within autocratic governments because they
want to keep healthy international relations. But how we can keep a
record of all the drafts of legislation that are happening right now?
How we can use this information and create an action for the public to
show their agreement or not for every change that happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python supports two major programming paradigms: procedures, and object
orientation. This talk will claim that, when it comes to code re-use,
these two paradigms are NOT created equal: because object-oriented
programming encourages the programmer to write methods that consider
everything else inside of &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; to be fair game, it encourages highly
coupled code that proves brittle when extended.&lt;/p&gt;
