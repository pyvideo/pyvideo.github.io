The presentation will cover best practices for project structure and code organization, as well as strategies for ensuring reproducibility, collaboration, and managing dependencies. By implementing CI/CD principles in scientific application development processes, researchers can improve efficiency, reliability, and maintainability, ultimately accelerating research.&lt;/p&gt;
