This choice was made for various reasons - Python backend, Django HTML templates, included security infrastructure and included ORM. I explored options to execute partial requests from Django HTML templates, without submitting requests to reload the complete page. This is possible with HTMX and Alpine.js. I thought I should share my experience with the broader Django community. I will prepare a sample CRUD app to explain the functionality, this will be styled with Tailwind CSS to look modern and usable.&lt;/p&gt;
