technology, and how methods developed to address verifiablity in
statistical publishing can be adapted to other areas such as technical
writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2015, a group of researchers set out to replicate the results
obtained in a set of 100 published psychology research papers. It
turned out that only 29 out of the 100 could be replicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 2016 elections, so-called &amp;quot;fake news&amp;quot;--fabricated news
published on venues such as Facebook--influenced many voters in their
choice of candidates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the field of technical writing, it is not uncommon to discover
that technical documentation is inaccurate. Although the docs might
have been accurate when first published, the underlying technology
evolved rendering the docs obsolete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic, public-policy, and business decisions are sometimes made after
accepting published (mis)information at face value. The costs can
beconsiderable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information often arrives in the form of an electronic document,
such as a web page or PDF file. To verify the information, someone has
to &amp;quot;fact check&amp;quot; it. But what if the document could, in some sense,
&amp;quot;speakfor itself&amp;quot; and demonstrate the veracity of what it is saying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the verifiability crisis in science, statisticians
havedeveloped technology to create &amp;quot;intelligent documents&amp;quot; that not
onlyreport the results of a statistical analysis, but can also re-create
theanalysis itself.&lt;/p&gt;
