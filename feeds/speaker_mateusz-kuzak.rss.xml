how to program but any volunteer that is going to start a new teaching
group could have hundreds of questions related with concepts order,
examples, exercises, libraries and text editor/IDE. Panellists will
share their experience when teaching Python to newcomers from different
backgrounds as part of their volunteer work for some organisations such
as PyLadies, DjangoGirls, Code for Life, Software Carpentry,
Data Carpentry, etc. Among the panellists we will have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mateusz Kuzak, from the Netherlands eScience Center and volunteer for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice Harpole, from the University of Southampton;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celine Boudier, from Code for Life;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raniere Silva (as moderator), from the Software Sustainability Institute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All questions from the audience are welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;
