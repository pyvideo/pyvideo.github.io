This need came from my own problem of building lots and lots of simple services (usually in Python) and not having the time or desire to build a business around them. These services include Localtunnel, RequestBin, Airscript, and others. Here I'll show these projects, their place in the ecosystem, and what I plan to do about making them sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

As a rule, Celery processes use the same code base as the main application. I suggest to have a look at Celery from the other side and try to use in as a transport for linking the dispersed application components.  The report will show the particular examples of API realization on Celery, take a good look at questions connected with the routing of demands to workers. Also there will be told why exactly Celery is so good for inside API building, in what situations the usage can be excess. The audience will learn how to connect the components of dispersed application in the whole thing  fast and without extra consumptions, get rid of coherence, and possibly to look at your application from the other side. It’s taken that listeners know the queue messengers concept and conceive why Celery or analogous solutions  can be used&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, Django Core Developer Russell Keith-Magee will gaze into his crystal ball and speculate about what the future may hold for Django -- both in the short term, and possibilities for the long term.
Audience: Existing Django users interested in what the future holds for their web framework of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

You have to first install setuptools/distribute and then use easy_install/pip.  Installation of packages is slow and depends on reachability of  pypi.python.org and other servers.  There is no quality control where you could e. g. see on which platforms the package successfully installs, let alone has its automated tests passing.  There is not really a standard way to run tests.  This talk outlines my plans for improving the situation, including a demo of a new (in-development) PyPI server that speeds up installation by an order of magnitude for many packages.&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, mass update.&lt;/p&gt;

There is Linux and other system instruments laid in the depths of these solutions and there’s a good web-interface shown on the surface. Tornado takes the middle  and provides the connection between “top” and “bottom”. Why does it go this way and is why web-framework a successful decision for system programming? You will learn all of these issues from the report. Report will be helpful for Python-programmers, who want to learn the possibilities of Tornado, and also for developers of dispersed systems solving the problems of connection organization between components.&lt;/p&gt;

Particularly I will tell about interval based approach which allows working with the system at any moment in the past, do the whole system back-off or back-off of its separate parts. This approach realized in a small library “documents” for Django, but the concept is easy movable. I will take the usage of this approach for traditional applications and for versioned EAV database building, showing data like a graph.&lt;/p&gt;

How has the Django project managed this process of growth? What lessons can other projects learn from Django's successes and failures? And how can Django protect it's long term survival? In this talk, Django Core Developer Russell Keith-Magee will reflect on the history of the Django project, and look at how Django -- and other open source projects -- can build, grow and sustain their communities. Audience: Anyone involved in open source.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope that after the report and the workshop everyone's skill of porting code on Python 3 is systematized.

However, even experienced developers, who are familiar with relational databases, their experience don't help them and sometimes it interfere. I'll tell about using MongoEngine, which allows you to bring methods of application development by Python with using MongoDB to more traditional approaches. This will be useful all Python developers who have an interest in MongoDB and non relational databases.&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally I'll cover various high level components of an early scaling strategy such as database sharding, CDN caching, and overall architecture to simplify the growing pains.
- How to approach sharding (architecture)
- Horizontal vs vertical, which solution is right and when
- How we sharded the Django ORM
- Materialized views using Redis
- Buffered counters using Redis&lt;/p&gt;
