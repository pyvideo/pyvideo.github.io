website, we try to figure out what they search, and provide suggestions
as they type along. What product, what brand, from which categories?
Solr provides a SuggestComponent that is a good start, but in a lot of
situations we need fallback strategies: what should we show to a user
searching for just a brand name? Or for a singular offer we can't
actually show them? What alternatives can we dig up? And behind all this
backfill logic lurks that dreaded question: what amount of irrelevant
garbage is worse than the horror vacui of an empty result set?&lt;/p&gt;

a byte-minimal correct solution. Such an answer often takes shortcuts,
is horribly inefficient, and definitely violates almost 100% of PEP 8.
Like any playful interaction with a subject, it can however improve your
understanding of it, as well as teach you about weird interactions
regarding operator precedence, lexer quirks and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going over basic definitions, I will take a small number of
well-known or straightforward programming tasks and go through the act
of golfing an answer together step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
