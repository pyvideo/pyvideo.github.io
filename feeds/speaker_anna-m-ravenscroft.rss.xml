&lt;p&gt;Presented by Anna M Ravenscroft (PSF)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PSF recently adopted a diversity statement. While some argue that we
should do this just because it's &amp;quot;the right thing to do&amp;quot;, others
question why we, as a technical community, should even worry about
diversity. This talk addresses the diversity question, not in moralistic
or ethical terms, but in pragmatic ones. Studies on creativity and
productivity demonstrate the potential benefits of diversity for the
Python community. Making Python the best language it can be is not
merely helped by increasing diversity, but may be dependent on
diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
