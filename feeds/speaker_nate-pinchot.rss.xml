&lt;p&gt;I'll take you through the most effective performance lessons we've
learned and show you how you can implement them (with example code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TWO-PASS CACHING WITH CLASS-BASED VIEWS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far, this is one of the most effective performance optimizations we
have done in terms of HTTP response time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using class-based views, we are able to do two-pass caching. On the
first pass of the view, we render everything that's not specific to the
user. No AJAX calls needed to get user specific content on the page.
I'll show you how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DATA CACHING STRATEGY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll review how we use multiple levels of data caching to greatly
improve the amount of time it takes to rebuild the entire cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DB READ REPLICAS FOR PERFORMANCE / CUSTOM BACKEND FOR FAILOVER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read replica databases are great for performance. You've set up a few
read replicas and implemented a fancy new database router which sends
read queries to the read replicas (round robin) for any data that
doesn't need to be up-to-the-millisecond fresh (e.g. blog posts, product
descriptions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're sitting back and relishing in the improved performance when one
of your database read replicas goes offline. Now what? I'll show you how
we implemented a custom database backend to handle this gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIGRATIONS RULES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is less of a performance optimization and more of a set of rules we
try to stick to. I'll review some snafus we've had and how we avoided
future production issues while keeping the site at 99% uptime.&lt;/p&gt;
