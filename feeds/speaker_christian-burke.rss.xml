This year, we would like to discuss and demonstrate our custom AI Rainforest models, showcasing generative fauna, flora, and funga from the Amazon Rainforest, as well as highlight our research in AI-based Language Preservation for an indigenous tribe, the Yawanawa. In addition, we would like to exhibit how PyTorch enables us to conduct this research and how we are using it to create AI models to preserve the rainforest and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
