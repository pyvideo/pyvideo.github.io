They're mocked,
maligned, and feared; the but of every joke, the scapegoat for every
rounding error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this stigma is not deserved. Floats are friends! Friends that have
been stuck between a rock and a computationally hard place, and been
forced to make some compromises along the way… but friends never the
less!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll look at the compromises that were made while
designing the floating point standard (IEEE754), how to work within
those compromises to make sure that &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3&lt;/tt&gt; and not
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;0.30000000000000004&lt;/tt&gt;, how and when floats can and cannot be safely
used, and some interesting history around fixed point number
representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is ideal for anyone who understands (at least in principle)
binary numbers, anyone who has been frustrated by &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;nan&lt;/tt&gt; or the fact
that &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;0.3 == 0.1 + 0.2 =&amp;gt; False&lt;/tt&gt;, and anyone who wants to be the life
of their next party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cover more complicated numerical methods for, ex,
ensuring that algorithms are floating-point safe. Also, if you're
already familiar with the significance of &amp;quot;52&amp;quot; and the term &amp;quot;mantissa&amp;quot;,
this talk might be more entertaining than it will be educational for
you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave with some dangerous Python trivia, and the tools

&lt;p&gt;The talk takes a deep dive into a StackOverflow question asking why
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;quot;x&amp;quot; in (&amp;quot;x&amp;quot;, )&lt;/tt&gt; is faster than &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;quot;x&amp;quot; == &amp;quot;x&amp;quot;&lt;/tt&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28885132/why-is-x-in-x-faster-than-x-x/28885213#28885213"&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28885132/why-is-x-in-x-faster-than-x-x/28885213#28885213&lt;/a&gt;),
including a discussion of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;dis.disassemble&lt;/tt&gt;, the Pyhton stack machine,
and reading the CPython source. If time permits, there will be other fun
examples, a whirlwind tour of debugging, and a couple of homework
assignments.&lt;/p&gt;

experience, but what if someone is learning Python and Django with a
HTML/CSS background? This tutorial focuses on the web-based features of
Django — templates and the admin — and goes over the basic building
blocks of Django programming to get web designers excited and interested
in learning more.&lt;/p&gt;
