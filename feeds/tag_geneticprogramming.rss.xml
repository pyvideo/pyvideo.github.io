&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can create and evolve programs that find solutions to
problems? This talk walks through how to use Genetic Programming (GP) as
a tool to discover solutions to hard problems, when to use GP, how best
to set up the GP environment, and how to interpret the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can create and evolve programs that find solutions to
problems? This talk walks through how to use Genetic Algorithms and
Genetic Programming as tools to discover solutions to hard problems,
when to use GA/GP, setting up the GA/GP environment, and interpreting
the results. Using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/"&gt;pyevolve&lt;/a&gt;,
we'll walk through a real-world implementation creating a GP that
predicts the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Genetic Programming (GP) are methods used to
search for and optimize solutions in large solution spaces. GA/GP use
concepts borrowed from natural evolution, such as mutation, cross-over,
selection, population, and fitness to generate solutions to problems. If
done well, these solutions will become better as the GA/GP runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA/GP has been used in problem domains as diverse as scheduling,
database index optimization, circuit board layout, mirror and lens
design, game strategies, and robotic walking and swimming. They can also
be a lot of fun, and have been used to evolve aesthetically pleasing
artwork, melodies, and approximating pictures or paintings using
polygons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GA/GP is fun to play with because often-times an unexpected solution
will be created that will give new insight or knowledge. It might also
present a novel solution to a problem, one that a human may never
generate. Solutions may also be inscrutable, and determining why a
solution works is interesting in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
