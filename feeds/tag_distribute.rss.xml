&lt;p&gt;Presented by Tarek Ziadé&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python Package Index (PyPI) became over the last years an essential
tool to share your Python programs. As long as you use Distutils
standards, you can register and upload your work at PyPI in a few
seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects like Setuptools and Pip added great features on the top of this
: the ability to fetch PyPI to install a project and its dependencies.
So you can &amp;quot;easy_install A-Program&amp;quot; and everything is done
automatically for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all these features have shown the flaws and limitations of the
current Distutils design, and the urgency to make it evolve with respect
to the existing OS-specific packaging systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will detail the biggest issues that need to be solved, and the
work that is being done. It will end up with a presentation of the
Distutils roadmap, and an overview of the Distribute project, the
Setuptools replacer.&lt;/p&gt;
