But truly excellent reports require a lot of work in the final steps to get numerical and stylistic formatting just right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;{epoxy} is a new package that uses {glue} to give authors templating superpowers. Epoxy works in R Markdown and Quarto, in markdown, LaTeX, and HTML outputs. It also provides easy templating for Shiny apps for dynamic data-driven reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond epoxy's features, this talk will also touch on tips and approaches for data-driven reporting that will be useful to a wide audience, from R Markdown experts to the Quarto and Shiny curious.&lt;/p&gt;
