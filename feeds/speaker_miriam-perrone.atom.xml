&lt;p&gt;Just as in code, in our daily life we have patterns that can be
returning patterns. Can we debug our life, via debugging skills we
learned in coding? Come to experience this talk to learn how to debug
your life! In daily life we have patterns and even returning patterns,
at least if you take time to recognize some parts happening in your
life. This can be in your career, customer relations, and even in
personal and family relations. Nice patterns lead to success and
inspiration. Bad pattens leads to bore-out, burn-out or even worse… In
this talk Dennie and special guest speaker Miriam – a well-known Belgian
speaker and experience expert in Autism – will take you on a journey
where they explain life patterns via metaphors in the tech/ developer
world. You will learn how to recognize life patterns exactly as in code,
engineering, and business patterns. When you recognize the patterns it’s
finally time to learn to debug those patterns! Just as you debug code
patterns with changing the source code, you learn to debug life patterns
via changing lifestyle, and in specific thoughts. As you see, those are
just the same. Slides:&lt;/p&gt;
