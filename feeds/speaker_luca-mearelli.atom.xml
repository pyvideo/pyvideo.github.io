The network formed by the persons
who interact in the conversations inside an online community can thus be
analysed with the tools of the network science to understand their
characteristics. Enriching online conversations with social network
analysis we hope to be able to give community moderators tools that
could help them to build better communities and guide the collective
intelligence processes inside them. The great vision in this is to be
able to contribute to building the engines that could help us to build
effective platforms for participatory democracy ( a better overview on
these theme is explained by my colleague Alberto Cottica in this TEDx
talk: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKrM2c-ww_k"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKrM2c-ww_k&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edgesense is our attempt at making tools for social network analysis
accessible to all those that could gain the most from them but maybe did
not yet know their potential. Edgesense is built around a set of scripts
that process the community data and extract the most relevant network
metrics and the network structure and a dashboard that is able to
present them giving a clear view of them. Through the dashboard
community managers can for the first time see in a glimpse who is
talking to who, which users are central to the community and those who
are on the periphery. They can see which sub-communities are developing
inside the larger online conversation and who is acting as a bridge
between them.This is very useful to guide the conversation or to
determine which users have the most authority (through measures of
centrality or “pagerank&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python has been central to the development of Edgesense it has made
possible to create a processing pipeline that takes the data from
various sources (Drupal community sites, twitter conversations, mailing
lists data) and builds the network of interactions among the users.
Python has also enabled us to choose from a very rich library of social
network analysis algorithms to calculate the metrics that we are
presenting in the dashboard to help understand the social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk we’ll look at which choices we were required when
building a data processing application that takes real-life data,
extracts useful informations and prepares t for visualisation. We’ll see
a primer on the network science required to interpret the structure of
the users community and how the algorithms and the metrics were chosen.
We’ll also present the challenges that we are facing to extend Edgesense
to ever larger communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will be useful to both developers interested in using
python to do social network analysis and to those already skilled in it
which could find inspiration in the problems we are trying to solve with
Edgesense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edgesense has been developed by Wikitalia within the CATALYST EC project
on collective intelligence and it is available as open source software:

is available here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://matera2019.edgesense.spazidigitali.com/"&gt;http://matera2019.edgesense.spazidigitali.com/&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
