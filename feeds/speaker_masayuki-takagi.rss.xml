Its API is to designed to provide high compatibility with NumPy so that in most cases you can gain several times speed improvement from drop-in replacement to your code. CuPy is actively developed and is continuously well-maintained, resulting in 2,700+ GitHub stars and 13,000+ commits. CuPy was also presented at PyCon 2018&lt;/p&gt;
