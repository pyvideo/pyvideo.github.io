science, machine learning, and online computing. However, computations
that are simple to perform at small scales (e.g., on a laptop) can
easily become prohibitively difficult as data sizes and analysis
complexity grows. For example, efficient interactive analysis at scale
can require real-time management of parallel and/or cloud computing
resources, orchestration of remote task execution, and data staging
across wide area networks. In this talk we introduce Parsl (Parallel
Scripting Library), a pure Python library for orchestrating the
concurrent and parallel execution of interactive and many-task
workloads, and demonstrate how it integrates with the scientific Python
ecosystem and how it is being used in a variety of scientific domains.
The talk is intended for attendees interested in interactive and
parallel computing.Presenter(s): Speaker: Kyle Chard, Computation
