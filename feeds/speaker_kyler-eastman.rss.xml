of thousands of tracks every day from GPS fitness devices around the
planet. Within this massive database of fitness activity lies untold
insights into human behavior. In this talk, I'll show how I use
Python-based analysis tools for identifying running events, from 5ks to
marathons). Using a combination of Amazon Redshift SQL, scipy,
matplotlib &amp;amp; pandas, I'll show how you can glean a variety of insight
into running event performance, from weather and training effects on
speed, to regional &amp;amp; demographic differences in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
