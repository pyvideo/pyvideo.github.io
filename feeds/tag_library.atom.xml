It covers several patterns for cleanly organizing related and overlapping functionality in a way that statisfies both humans and static analysis tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do when you have to choose between designing your function for one of two common use cases?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about when the same logical operations (say, multiplication or concatenation) need to have different implementations depending on the type of the arguments they are applied to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kinds of questions can be vexing when trying to design a clean, well-scoped API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover several strategies for grouping related functionality in a way that presents a logically clean interface to both humans and static analysis tools like type checkers and document generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternate constructors with &amp;#64;classmethod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inheritance with &amp;#64;staticmethod and &amp;#64;classmethod&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dispatch by type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new convention for namespacing functions: variants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

In the process, the team adopted Rye as their package manager, and the presentation will also cover the features of Rye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply approaching a monorepo might unnecessarily increase complexity, so the speaker will share methods the team considered and implemented to prevent this while maximizing the benefits. The speaker will also introduce their personal experience in building and operating monorepos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is recommended for those who need to build shared libraries using Python or operate multiple services in an MSA environment.&lt;/p&gt;
