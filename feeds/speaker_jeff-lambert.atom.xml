This talk will discuss the options available to us as developers for encrypting the traffic between the nodes of our distributed applications to insure that even intercepted messages are un-readable, and un-encryptable by an adversary.  To achieve this we will use one-time and self-destructible private keys, along with dispensable, one-use secrets to generate our encrypted message.  We will then learn how to structure our message for transmission to insure it is decryptable by the receiving party, with little risk of being compromised during transmission.  To end, we will learn how to decrypt the messages received &amp;quot;on the fly&amp;quot;, using only the supplied crypted message itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at mid-level Python users but is understandable by beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
