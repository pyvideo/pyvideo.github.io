&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting areas in data science is the development of new predictive applications; apps used to drive product recommendations, predict machine failures, forecast airfare etc. These applications output real-time predictions and recommendations in response to user and machine input to directly derive business value and create cool experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting apps utilize multiple types of data (tables, graphs, text &amp;amp; images) in a creative way. In this talk, we will show how to quickly build and deploy a predictive app that exploits the power of combining different data types together using GraphLab Create, our open source based Python software.&lt;/p&gt;
