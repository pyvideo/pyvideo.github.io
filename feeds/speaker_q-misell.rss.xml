Yes, I'm a little mad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following on from my talk last year on making a C compiler for the BBC
Micro, I will be using said compiler to write and run a python
interpreter that can run on the BBC Micro. Come to learn about how
compilers work in general, how python is technically a compiled and
interpreted language, the struggles I had fitting as much as possible of
python into 64K of RAM and ROM, and some interesting things I learnt
about python along the way. If you already know a lot about compilers
then this may be the talk for you, as it's not every day you have to fit
a compiler into such limited RAM, and such a limited instruction set.&lt;/p&gt;
