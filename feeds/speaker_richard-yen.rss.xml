The latter will not be content with a poorly-performing query when they know that better performance can be achieved with some tuning, an index, and/or a query rewrite.  For developers and DBAs, this talk discusses what EXPLAIN does, how to interpret its output, what inferences can be extracted from its output, and what can be done to improve query performance.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will give non-DBAs an insight into how the world's most powerful open-source database works, and the kind of tools and features that are readily available for people who unexpectedly find themselves in the DBA pilot's seat.  Topics covered will include query tuning, monitoring, indexing, and a basic run-down of some configurables to help you know what options are at your disposal&lt;/p&gt;
