In particular, we use &amp;quot;proxy re-encryption&amp;quot;, a special type of cryptosystem that allows to delegate decryption rights of encrypted information. Nodes in our network provide a cryptographically-enforced access control service that allows users to securely share information with others, but in such a way that nodes are completely oblivious to the data that is encrypted: at no point nodes can read anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll cover how Python has enabled the vast majority of our implementation, from constructing a low-level library for elliptic curve arithmetic on top of cryptography.io, to interacting with the Ethereum blockchain with py-geth and web3.py. Finally, you'll see a practical example of the use of pyUmbral, our cryptographic library (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nucypher/pyUmbral"&gt;https://github.com/nucypher/pyUmbral&lt;/a&gt;), and a live demo of how to share data securely with the NuCypher network.&lt;/p&gt;
