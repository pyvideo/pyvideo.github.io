&lt;p&gt;A deep dive into a project that was never intended to be. 3 years ago, I threw up a simple script to help a single school setup network booting/logins with Raspberry Pis, up onto Github. Since then, the open source project has grown to 4000+ lines of Python/Bash and is used right across the world, from a prison in Kenya to hundreds of schools across Europe and North America. The talk will include an overview of how the project accidentally came into existence, a bit on how to build software/documentation for educators (many complete beginners to Linux) and how this was a complete shock to me (a teenage programmer). I will end the talk with a dive into the underlying technologies and how Python and Bash can be made to effectively work together.&lt;/p&gt;
