“If only I had ten more GPUs, I could train my model in time.”
“I want to run my model on a cheap smartphone, but it’s probably too heavy and slow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like you, then you might like this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring the landscape of training and inference, we cover a myriad of tricks that step-by-step improve the efficiency of most deep learning pipelines, reduce wasted hardware cycles, and make them cost-effective. We identify and fix inefficiencies across different parts of the pipeline, including data preparation, reading and augmentation, training, and inference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a data-driven approach and easy-to-replicate TensorFlow examples, finely tune the knobs of your deep learning pipeline to get the best out of your hardware. And with the money you save, demand a raise!&lt;/p&gt;
