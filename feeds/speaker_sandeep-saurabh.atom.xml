&lt;p&gt;I have done my Bachelors and Masters of Technology from prestigious Indian Institute of Technology -Delhi, in Mathematics and Computing. Since college days, I have been working in neural network projects using all kinds of languages like MATLAB, Java and python. I did internship in distributed computing at Chinese Academy of Science in 2011 and the experience which I had there was incredible. It taught me the importance and pleasure of interacting and sharing knowledge with people around the world. Currently I am working as a Senior Data Scientist in an analytics firm BRIDGEi2i Analytics Solutions in Bangalore.&lt;/p&gt;
