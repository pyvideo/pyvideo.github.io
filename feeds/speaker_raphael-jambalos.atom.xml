But how exactly do you transition from the simple app structure you saw in tutorials to the mature production-ready form you need? That's exactly the same problem we faced over the past 24 months. In this talk, I will share my team's experience on how we solved this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directory Structure - how to arrange your Python code
* Controllers, Handlers, Helpers, Models, Gateways: Building your app's directories for single responsibility between components
* Multi-repository vs. Single-repository approach: The pros and cons
* Lambdalith (monolith Lambda) vs. Lambda Functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python development in the context of AWS Lambda
* Don't be afraid to use Exceptions - monitoring your app's performance with the error count in Lambda
* Use print statements deliberately - using CloudWatch to create searchable logs and metric filters to create alarms out of your logs
* Use AWS Lambda Layers to package Python packages with OS Native dependencies (i.e psycopg2, cryptography)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools of the trade: Leveraging AWS Services to reduce the development you have to do in-house and focus on the features that make your client's business stand out
* Lambda - as your compute engine.
* API Gateway - for your routes and data validation
* DynamoDB - as your NoSQL database
* SQS - for your queue service
* Parameter Store - for storing configuration
* Step Functions - orchestrating workflows in AWS
* Cognito - using AWS' ready-made authentication service
* ECS - when your workloads reach past 15mins, turn to ECS containers to finish the job&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Belt Lambda: using Serverless Framework features to get ahead of Lambda's limitations and ensure best practices
* Using AWS Layers
* Prune your Lambda Applications regularly
* Managing environment variables
* Have a local environment&lt;/p&gt;

#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
