Servers often do not have convenient tools, such as Python (numpy/pandas) of R, moreover, the data might not fit into memory. This talk shows how to make fast but inconvenient command line tools great again. This is based on work done in Yandex and allows to process Gbs of data with one-liner commands.&lt;/p&gt;

While there were several similar projects, the author decided to write another one. Why reinvent the wheel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the library is the most popular Python implementation of JSON-RPC protocol. Kirill wants to share his ideas behind package architecture, positioning, and promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
