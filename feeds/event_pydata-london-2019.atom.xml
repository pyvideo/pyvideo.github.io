Maarten Breddels, Jovan Veljanoski
Audience level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show how to deal with massive datasets using small resources using the Python Vaex DataFrame library. Using computational graphs, efficient algorithms and storage (Apache Arrow / hdf5) Vaex can easily handle up to a billion rows, even on your laptop. As a bonus, Vaex can automatically generate a Machine Learning pipeline using the graph structure build-up internally in the DataFrame.&lt;/p&gt;

The Data Engineering team is responsible for delivering live financial data to systematic trading strategies and maintaining historical data store for research purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have multiple live data feeds from various vendors which tick real time data onto a live message bus. This message bus does not maintain any history which we require for both research and trading purposes. To satisfy these requirements we by and large use two technologies; Kafka and Mongo. Both of these technologies are driven from our in-house Python clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each &amp;quot;tick&amp;quot; is first written to Kafka under a topic that corresponds to the upstream data vendor by a set of tick collectors that consume from the live message bus and publish to Kafka. Each message is then transformed into a standard MarketData message structure which is encoded into binary payloads using MsgPack. Another set of Python processes consume from Kafka and write to an Arctic datastore backed by Mongo. Arctic is a high performance datastore for numeric time-series data which Man Alpha Technology has open sourced (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/manahl/arctic"&gt;https://github.com/manahl/arctic&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the most of our Kafka pipelines we have our own Python Kafka clients built on top of the open source clients that provide a number of additional features. For example, the client deterministically assigns market data symbols to a Kafka partitions to maintain time ordering of the messages for each symbol and it allows us to use timestamps as a first class concept when seeking and consuming from Kafka. Although this feature is now available natively at the broker level (Time Based Search), this has been implemented in our client since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the talk we will dive deeper into the details of our data pipelines as described above, as well as how we monitor, deploy and maintain the production and research pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately acquiring labels is expensive or impossible in many domains. Recently, the new paradigm of weak-supervision has emerged in which a set of weak and cheap labelling sources are mapped to high-quality labels. In this presentation, I'll describe the methods and research underpinning weak-supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquiring quality labels for supervised models is expensive and sometimes impossible. Unsupervised models usually perform poorly and semi-supervised models make strong similarity assumptions so that labels can be propagated. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged: weak supervision. A weakly supervised model has a set of unreliable labelling functions such as heuristic rules, similarity methods, weak classifiers and human labelling. As such, weak supervision can be considered a generalisation of semi-supervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labelling functions should be selected to promote diversity, much like an ensemble, with a variety of bias-variance tradeoff profiles and correlations. The characteristics of each labelling function do not have to be known explicitly but after training the model can provide feedback on the quality of labelling sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weakly-supervised model combines, disambiguates and prunes the unreliable labels using an unsupervised generative component to produce a reliable probabilistic label set which can then be consumed by a traditional supervised component. Some practitioners have even heralded weak-supervision as software 2.0 in which a central ML model governs the behaviour of an application based upon vast quantities of weak labels provided by non-experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I'll describe the methods and research underpinning weak-supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
