challenge is coming up to speed on the intersecting parts of these 2
disciplines. More than any other type of tech writing, operations TW is
the art of supporting highly technical, cross-functional teams. Most
companies create super secret, bleeding edge technologies to make their
data centers efficient, powerful, reliable, economical, and, hopefully,
green. There are few opportunities to gain background info to bring
yourself up to speed and feel confident about your technical prowess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a little talked about area of TW that's growing in importance
and demand. At Google, it's been difficult to find writers qualified to
handle the cross-functional complexities/hit the ground running, and the
ramp up is steep. I'll address the demands of working in this
challenging but fascinating field, as well as some cultural perks such
as working with physical engineers (mechanical, electrical,
manufacturing), travel, and developing one's photography skills -- and
saying goodbye to capturing screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
