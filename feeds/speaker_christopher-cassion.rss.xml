Code reviews are critical but tedious to do manually. This is why we built a context-engineering approach at CodeRabbit that mimics how senior engineers review Python code. We feed context to LLMs from multiple sources including issue tickets, dependency graphs, MCP servers (Notion, Confluence), Linters/SAST, and your AI coding agent guidelines. This approach helps LLMs catch hidden bugs and edge cases that would otherwise slip through.&lt;/p&gt;
