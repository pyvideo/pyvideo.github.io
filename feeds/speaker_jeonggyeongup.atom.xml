&lt;p&gt;All developers want to write good code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is difficult to define exactly what good code is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not possible to define good code in all situations,
but I have summarized the characteristics of good code based on web services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I will explain how to write good code,
using Django as an example, as easily as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you feel that your productivity is decreasing while developing,
I prepared this presentation in the hope that you can take a moment to organize your thoughts and get ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
