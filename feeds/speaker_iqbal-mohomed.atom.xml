a self-driving lego mindstorms robot! The body of the robot is built
with Lego Mindstorms. An Android smartphone is used to capture the view
in front of the robot. A user first teaches the robot how to drive; this
is done by making the robot go around the track a small number of times.
The image data, along with the user action is used to train a Neural
Network. At run-time, images of what is in front of the robot are fed
into the neural network and the appropriate driving action is selected.
This project showcases the power of python's libraries, as they enabled
me to put together a sophisticated working system in a very short amount
of time. Specifically, I made use of the Python Image Library to
downsample images, as well as the PyBrain neural network library. The
robot was controlled using the nxt-python library. A high-level
