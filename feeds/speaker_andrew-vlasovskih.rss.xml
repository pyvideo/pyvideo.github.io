We'll consider available means of static analysis code by Python (PyLint, PyFlakes, Pep8, inspection IDE) and will talk about problems that they can find automatically in code. I'll talk about the approaches that are based static analysis in these tools and about the specifics of the analysis of Python as dynamic language.
