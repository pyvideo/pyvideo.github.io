&lt;p&gt;Let’s build an event driven application together! Using Flask as
framework we’ll add the powerful Apache Kafka, a streaming platform, as
backend… all live on stage! Join to understand how to integrate your
application with Apache Kafka! Solid event driven applications are based
on a widely adopted coding framework and a resilient data streaming
technology. While Flask is a common choice for the framework, a wise
selection of the backend data systems can bring benefits in terms of
ease of integration and performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session we will explore Apache Kafka, a data streaming platform,
that enables reliable real-time data integration for your event driven
application. We will look at the types of problems that Kafka is best at
solving, and show how to use it in your own applications. We’ll then
take a look at Kafka in action, by creating a Flask web application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After understanding how to produce and consume events from Apache Kafka,
we’ll then introduce Kafka Connect, a selection of pre-built connectors
making Apache Kafka your only backend interface, no matter where your
data originally sits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re using Flask, and want to understand how to make your
application event driven by integrating it with the most used streaming
technology, this session is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

As our applications modernise and evolve to become more event-driven, the requirements for data are changing. In this session we will explore Apache Kafka, a data streaming platform, to enable reliable real-time data integration for your applications.
We will look at the types of problems that Kafka is best at solving, and show how to use it in your own applications. Whether you have a new application or are looking to upgrade an existing one, this session includes advice on adding Kafka using the Python libraries and includes code examples (with bonus discussion of pizza toppings) to use.
With Kafka in place, many things are possible so this session also introduces Kafka Connect, a selection of pre-built connectors that you can use to route events between systems and integrate with other tools. This session is recommended for engineers and architects whose applications are ready for next-level data abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
