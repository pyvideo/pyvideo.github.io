This talk is focused on the latter, showing how you (a developer of a Wagtail-powered site) can set up your models, templates, and workflows in order to make it as easy as possible for your editors to create websites that are as accessible as possible. I say &amp;quot;as possible&amp;quot; because it's important to recognize that it's not possible for a website to ever be considered 100% accessible, but by putting some care into what we do on the development side, we can prevent some of the most widespread accessibility issues that users may come across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics that will be covered include:
- How to use Wagtail's [new built-in accessibility checker](&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wagtail.org/blog/introducing-wagtails-new-accessibility-checker/"&gt;https://wagtail.org/blog/introducing-wagtails-new-accessibility-checker/&lt;/a&gt;)
- Custom validation to ensure that a page has a logical heading order
- Ensuring alt text is used appropriately (Spoiler alert: every image doesn't need alt text!)
- Usage of &lt;cite&gt;aria-label&lt;/cite&gt; attributes to provide essential context to screen readers
- Providing timely, contextual help to editors as they create their content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, we’ll introduce you to the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG) and show you practical ways to incorporate
accessibility into your web development. We’ll build a blog website
using a Python-powered content management system called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wagtail.org"&gt;Wagtail&lt;/a&gt; and demonstrate how you can make your
project more accessible as you go. We’ll show you how to customize
Wagtail’s accessibility tools to continuously test and improve your
website accessibility over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To benefit the most from this tutorial, students should have at least
some basic knowledge of Python and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;. A laptop with Python 3.8 or
above installed on it is required to participate in the hands-on
exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
