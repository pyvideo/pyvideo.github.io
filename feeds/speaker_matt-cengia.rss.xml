&lt;p&gt;I'll cover how we gave each student full root access to their own &amp;quot;server&amp;quot;, through to how we built the course material to be a manageable learning curve over such a tight timeline, the challenges we faced with content delivery, and ideas for improvements before we run our next course.&lt;/p&gt;
