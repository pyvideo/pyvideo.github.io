They help with use cases like integrating multimodal data, building a data warehouse, improving data quality, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over many years, developers have put forth many design patterns or best practices for building data pipelines in Python using Pandas, Numpy, and more. However, one crucial criterion for creating a data pipeline is idempotency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will open with a brief overview of data pipelines and the importance of idempotency in distributed systems. We’ll look to answer the question: What does it take to build an idempotent data pipeline in Python with an example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our exploration will begin with the pitfalls of non-idempotent pipelines, then proceed to a methodology for building idempotent data pipelines and the design decisions that accompany them. Along the way, we’ll explore testing strategies using pytest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at those interested in building idempotent data pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
