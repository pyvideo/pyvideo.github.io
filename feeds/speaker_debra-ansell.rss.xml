The advent of CircuitPython - a variant of Python built to run on small microcontrollers and interact easily with hardware - has helped to facilitate her creative process by making it cheap and simple to quickly iterate and prototype new designs. Many CircuitPython modules exist which allow creators to control different types and configurations of LEDs with only a few lines of code. Debra will display some of her works and discuss how she uses CircuitPython in her creations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three amazing in-person conferences, this time we're moving PyCascades online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCascades is a regional PyCon in the Pacific Northwest, celebrating the west coast Python developer and user community. Our organizing team includes members of the Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland Python user groups.&lt;/p&gt;
