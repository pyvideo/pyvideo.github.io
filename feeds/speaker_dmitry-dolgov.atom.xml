&lt;p&gt;Functional programming is a quite popular paradigm nowadays, but it suffers from a lot of myths and misunderstandings around it. And one of them is that functional programming can be applied only in few special languages, which is wrong. This paradigm is just a language agnostic way of thinking about your code. We will discuss pros and cons of applying it in case of Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do anyone need this at all?
Since Python is a multi-paradigm language, what it already can provide
for FP?
Third-party libraries for FP in Python
