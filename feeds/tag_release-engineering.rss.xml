components written in Python. Created in 2010, it attracted thousands of
developers which produced hundreds of thousands of commits. It is
completely openly-developed: there is no single organization owning it,
and anyone can participate on a level playing ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this wild ride, we discovered new classes of issues, crafted
novel solutions, made mistakes and learned lessons, most of them
applicable to other open source projects. Come learn about software
engineering best practices, open collaboration advice and other fun tips
and tricks based on our experience ! No prior experience with OpenStack
is needed to attend this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
