affirmatively or destructively. Itâ€™s usage forms the basis of our
societies, our stories and our narratives. When children grow up in a
world where the stories consistently entitle them or belittle them, they
will internalize these beliefs without question. NLP considerably
automates the analysis that is paramount to setting the world right when
it comes to these societal beliefs. NLP has the potential to be an
excellent equalizer. Most children pick up notions from their
educational texts and the rules at their educational institute. Thus,
analyzing, identifying and eliminating cultural biases in the literature
used to educate would be among the first steps to fostering an equal
world. This presentation has an interdisciplinary basis, borrowing
concepts from psychology, linguistics, literature, statistics and
computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
