Ejections (CME) are a major concern for a manned mission to Mars. On
Earth surface, these particles are shielded by the Earth magnetic
field. In space and on the Martian surface, where such shielding is
absent or much weaker, CME pose a radiation hazard to the health of
astronauts. The development of tools to understand and forecast the
interplanetary space weather is a requirement for future manned space
missions in order to properly protect the astronauts from the
radiation environment. A variety of methods are currently developed
by the scientific community and a number of public tools for space
weather monitoring and forecast is already available online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a Python-based tool which takes advantage of two publicly
accessible space weather web portals. Our software combines the
forecast of CME and a real-time propagation model of energetic
particles throughout the inner Solar System and the Martian
atmosphere. It consistently recovers real-time relevant information
and provides with days-to-hours forecasts for the radiation dose
astronauts on Mars would be exposed to. The system raises an alert
signal when the radiation dose exceeds the security levels defined by
the main space agencies adopted as a reference. Our tool is meant to
be integrated in a virtual reality simulation of a human settlement
on the surface of Mars (Mars City Project www.mars-city.org).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prerequisite:  Intermediate knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
