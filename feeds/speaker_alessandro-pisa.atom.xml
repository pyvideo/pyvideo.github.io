&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the 2016 Olympics web site was built with Plone?
Did you know that many huge organizations that care about data protection use Plone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are good reason why Plone is such a successful Python project,
but probably the most important is that Plone does take into account
the security of your data very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, information and data play a crucial role, sometimes they
are the more important asset of a company.
They have to be in a digital form and accessible from every device,
it is no surprise that they are exposed to a growing threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk I will review Plone built in security protection systems.
In addition I will review some of its features, like the ability to create,
without writing a line of code, custom content types, to change documents
workflows, to organize your documents in a snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also talk about the foreseen new features that will be soon in
Plone and I will present Castle CMS and Quaive, some important projects
built on top of Plone that are currently under the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
