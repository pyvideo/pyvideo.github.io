It is her mission to improve the software quality at the DLR. But why is this necessary? After all we went to the moon with less computer power than of a modern smartphone! While there are a lot of success stories, there are also those stories where software failures resulted in mission failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk gives an overview of some of these unfortunate programming errors, their consequences, and how modern developement tries to prevent history from repeating.&lt;/p&gt;
