affecting any Linux system on Earth. For Internet-facing services it was
necessary to patch the servers as soon as possible: the time was running
low and our hero (me) was lying in a bad, due to a painful back-ache … a
disaster was looming … This is an account of how everything ended well,
due to an appropriate management of the server infrastructure. A lot of
procedures had already been automated with Fabric, and it was at the end
very easy - even if quite stressful - to update everything in a couple
of hours (~150 hosts in various configurations / locations). The talk is
a real case, and its objective is to help people understanding the
importance of proper server automation and management. Basic Python
knowledge will be enough to understand the presentation, all the
relevant information about Fabric will be explained during the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
