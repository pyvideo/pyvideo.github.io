topic in the IT industry. In this session, we’ll first explain how
Deep Learning — a subset of AI — differs from traditional Machine
Learning and how it can help you solve complex problems such as
computer vision or natural language processing. Then, we’ll show you
how to start writing Deep Learning applications in Python thanks to
MXNet, a popular library for Deep Learning for both CPUs and GPUs.
We'll also see how to use pre-trained models and we'll load one on a
Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera. Finally, we’ll show random
objects to the Pi…and listen to what it thinks the objects are,
thanks to the text-to-speech capabilities of Amazon Polly.&lt;/p&gt;
