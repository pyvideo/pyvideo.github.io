&lt;p&gt;“There’s more than one way to draw a map - lessons learned after the Google Maps SDK became unaffordable” by Basil Dubyk, Alexander Gaevsky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google Maps SDK: well-known, powerful, and extremely popular - and after July 2018, suddenly unaffordable. We needed to find an alternative for Django geospatial projects. This is the story of our search and what we found, and the lessons that we’d like to share from the experience. The good news is: we returned with new knowledge from our wanderings, and were able to migrate our existing projects successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

Internet nowadays. Thus, we also constantly evolve the way how we build
projects to sell and buy goods using our technologies of choice - Python
and Django. Ease of customization and flexibility made Oscar application
of my choice for building custom ecommerce platforms on top of Django,
allowing to satisfy client requirements without necessity of
implementing solution from scratch, since Oscar have ready-made
applications for basket, checkout, shipping etc, available for the
further tweak and refinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using and contributing to Django Oscar since 2015, designed
and supported various ecommerce projects in different fields (food,
accessories, shoes) and sizes during this time. In this talk I’m going
to share some of the experience and conclusions about building complex
ecommerce platform using Django, and eventually, Django Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will go through the next topics:&lt;/p&gt;
