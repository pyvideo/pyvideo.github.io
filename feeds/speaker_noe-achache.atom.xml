A classical approach is to transform the database images and the query images into embeddings via a feature extractor (e.g., a CNN or a ViT), so that they can be compared via a distance metric. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can be used to train a feature extractor without the need for expensive and time-consuming labeled training data. We will use DINO's SSL method to build a feature extractor and Milvus, an open-source vector database built for evolutionary similarity search, to index image representation vectors for efficient retrieval. We will compare the SSL approach with supervised and pre-trained feature extractors.&lt;/p&gt;
