&lt;p&gt;Outline
* The first part of this talk will cover all the basic elements of the inner workings of blockchain. To demonstrate this, we will be building a blockchain from scratch in Python.
Next, we will cover how to connect with, retrieve, and store information with a test blockchain using web3.py and related libraries.
* Finally, we will talk about some of the specifics for how to build applications on the blockchain and build a few apps to demonstrate how everything fits together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this talk, you will leave with:
* An understanding of all the basics of how blockchains work.
* Knowing how to run a local, test Ethereum blockchain.
* A basic knowledge of web3.py and how build Python applications on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
