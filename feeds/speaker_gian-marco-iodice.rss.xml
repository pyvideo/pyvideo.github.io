A key tenant of our mission is to democratize AI capabilities, empowering millions of developers to put advanced AI features into the hands of billions of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we'll explore how Arm is enabling the world’s leading open-source AI frameworks to leverage power-efficient Arm-based computing platforms and Arm architecture features, as a tool for enabling fast and secure AI workloads. The session focuses on how our strategic partnership with the Pytorch and Executorch community is enabling a seamless and transparent developer experience, to run workloads everywhere from cloud to edge. This session will highlight some of our optimized libraries, upstreamed contributions and a wealth of AI-related developer material to build the future of AI on Arm.&lt;/p&gt;
