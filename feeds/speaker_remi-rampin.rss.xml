Unfortunately, computational reproducibility can be very painful. Weâ€™ll present an open source tool for computational reproducibility, ReproZip. ReproZip is written in Python, and was designed to simplify the process of making an experiment reproducible across platforms. ReproZip creates self-contained, reproducible packages by automatically tracking, identifying, and capturing all its required dependencies: programs, libraries, data, and configuration files. The original user can share the package with others, who can then use ReproZip to unpack and rerun the experiment on their favorite operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
