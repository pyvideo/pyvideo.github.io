Are you mystified by complicated NumPy array operations that you wrote only 2 months ago? Come and learn how to accelerate your existing Python code by an order (or orders!) of magnitude using Numba. You'll learn about using just-in-time compilation, writing custom NumPy ufuncs (the easy way!), and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire tutorial is presented as a series of Jupyter Notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
