Multitenancy has proven to be a mature architecture that can achieve secure data segregation while sustaining application functionality for multiple clients with lower costs.

In this talk, we will demonstrate the benefits of multitenancy and provide a simple way to implement a lightweight, single-database, single-schema, multi-tenant architecture in virtually any Django application by using Django Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;
