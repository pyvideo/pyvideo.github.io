raw product descriptions. The text is short and noisy and highly
contextual and the labeling of attributes for training ML models is
costly. I discuss how we build a deep sequence CNN-BiLSTM-CRF model in
Pytorch to extract attributes from noisy text with minimum labeling
using an active learning approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Clustr, I am working on converting raw product data available with
SMEs to structured catalog. One of the key tasks of building catalogue
is extracting attributes from raw product titles. Typical attributes
include Brands, Color, Shape, measurement etc. Product titles are
usually very short text describing the product without any significant
grammar. The titles are very dependent on the user which generates very
noisy text with abbreviations, spelling mistakes, omiitted text,
improper spaces, transliteration etc. The additional challenge is
availability of labeled data to train a machine learning model on this.
The product data we receive is not labeled and labeling is a costly
excercise. I show how we built a deep sequence model with CNN, BiLSTM
and CRF architecture and tuned it using active learning methods for this
task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will discuss various deep sequence models combined with conditional
random fields to label attributes from such text and outline pros and
cons of different architectures. The model uses pretrained word
embeddings. I will outtine some of the challenges of sparse tokens and
noise while building our domain specific word embeddings. A key aspect
of the problem is the lack of labeled data and high cost of getting this
data. To minimize the cost of labeling I trained our model using an
active learning approach. The active labeling requires sampling
strategies such that minimum labeling can have maximum improvement in
model performance. I implemented both model confidence based sampling
and data coverage based sampling such that we are able to label examples
which the model is least confident about and which are very different
from the existing training examples. The active learning examples in a
single training iteration were only about 1000 examples. Training models
with such few examples required us to be very careful about overfitting
in training. I will also talk about how I regularized the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To rapidly iterate in experiments I created an experimental setup which
allowed rapid changes and traceability. It was challenging to measure
the performance of the model and understand the limitations of the
model. To do this more effectively, I tracked various metrics to measure
the performance of the model including various metrics relevant to the
Named Entity Tasks. These metrics were very informative in identifying
the gaps in the model. I will discuss these in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall this talk will provide audience a good in depth understanding of
how deep sequence models are built in Pytorch for challenging
information extraction tasks. They will understand the pros and cons of
different architectures, things to keep in mind while tuning such deep
models and how active learning is performed in deep sequence models.&lt;/p&gt;
