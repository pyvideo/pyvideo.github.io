reviewed in a timely fashion (surprise!) and you are nicely heading
towards your release milestone. The only thing missing are some key

&lt;p&gt;This talk is about when bad screenshots happen to good writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my presentation, I will talk about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What are some best practices everyone can use for screenshots?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some examples of really useless screenshots.&lt;/li&gt;
