discrete mathematics and computer science, including networks, cellular
automata, and agent-based models. &amp;nbsp;It has applications in many areas of
natural and social science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is a particularly good language for exploring and implementing
models of complex systems. &amp;nbsp;In this tutorial, we present material from
the draft second edition of &lt;em&gt;Think Complexity&lt;/em&gt;, and from a class we
teach at Olin College. &amp;nbsp;We will work with random networks using
NetworkX, with cellular automata using NumPy, and we will implement
simple agent-based models.&lt;/p&gt;
