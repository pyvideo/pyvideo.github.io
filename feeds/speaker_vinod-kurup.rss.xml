&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using RapidSMS to power democracy in Libya. As web developers, we often
think of the web as being a ubiquitous resource, available to everyone.
The truth is that there are still large groups of people who have either
limited or no web access. In addition, there are people who have
excellent web access, yet still prefer to use simpler tools to connect
to others. How can we reach these groups of people? While not perfectly
ubiquitous, SMS technology is much more widespread, especially in areas
that don't have great internet connectivity. It's also ubiquitous in the
sense that people who have excellent internet access still use SMS
frequently. The government of Libya recently implemented a voter
registration system and chose to use SMS as the implementation
technology, largely because of these reasons. In this talk, I will
explain how we used RapidSMS, a Django-based SMS framework, to build
this groundbreaking voter registration system. We will discuss the
basics of the RapidSMS framework, and show concrete examples from our
Libyan project. I will mostly describe concepts at a high level, though
familiarity with Python code may help you understand the details. If you
truly want your tools to reach everyone, adding SMS connectivity will
spread the power of your web apps.&lt;/p&gt;
