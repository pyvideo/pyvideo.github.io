But where did it come from? How did we come to have a tool that combines code execution, visualization, Markdown, and more? In this talk, we will dive into the development of the Jupyter Notebook and the older ideas that it built upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, we will look at tools that popularized the “computational notebook” interface. In 1988, Mathematica introduced this interface to the scientific community. In the 90s, tools like Maple competed with Mathematica to provide the best scientific programming environment. The early 2000s saw the rise in popularity of open-source scientific tools in Python, including IPython, leading to IPython Notebook and then Jupyter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to the present, we look at the expanding ecosystem beyond the Notebook. JupyterLab provides a richer programming environment. Voilà and Binder give users better options for sharing their notebooks. And increased language support has led to Jupyter being a tool not only for Julia, Python, and R, but for dozens of other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally: what is still to come? JupyerLab 2.0 promises even greater IDE-like capabilities, while IDEs increase their own Notebook support. Projects like Deepnote and CoCalc promise real-time collaboration on top of the Notebook interface. And the frustrations of working with Git are the source of a growing number of possible solutions. These efforts point us toward what the Jupyter Notebook could become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description
It’s 2019, and Moore’s Law is dead. CPU performance is plateauing, but GPUs provide a chance for continued hardware performance gains, if you can structure your programs to make good use of them. In this talk you will learn how to speed up your Python programs using Nvidia’s CUDA platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
CUDA is a platform developed by Nvidia for GPGPU--general purpose computing with GPUs. It backs some of the most popular deep learning libraries, like Tensorflow and Pytorch, but it has broader uses in data analysis, data science, and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several ways that you can start taking advantage of CUDA in your Python programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some common Python libraries, there are drop-in replacements that let you start running computations on the GPU, while still using APIs that you might be familiar with. For example, CuPy provides a Numpy-like API for interacting with multi-dimensional arrays. Another recent project is cuDF by RAPIDS AI, which mimics the pandas interface for dataframes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more control over your use of CUDA APIs, you can use the PyCUDA library, which provides bindings for the CUDA API that you can call from your Python code. Compared with drop-in libraries, it gives you the ability to manually allocate memory on the GPU, as well as to write custom CUDA code. However, it comes with some drawbacks, such as having to write your CUDA code as large strings in your Python program, and compiling your CUDA code while running your program, rather than beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the best performance you can use the Python C/C++ extension interface, the approach taken by deep learning libraries like Pytorch. One of the strengths of Python is the ability to drop down into C/C++, and libraries like Numpy take advantage of this for increased speed. If you use Nvidia’s nvcc compiler for CUDA, you can use the same extension interface to write custom programs in CUDA and then call them from your Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore each of these methods, provide examples to get started, and discuss in more detail the pros and cons of each approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll define agents practically: Large Language Models combined with
tools and memory. Moving beyond the abstract definition, I’ll show you
how to build your first agent using the OpenAI Python SDK and
fundamental Python concepts you’re already familiar with: functions,
loops, and conditions. From there, I will demonstrate how you can use
the CrewAI framework to abstract away the boilerplate code, allowing for
simpler setup of multi-agent systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end, you won't just understand agents; you'll be equipped and
inspired to build your own, ready to tackle custom tasks by integrating
the APIs that matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
