Code generating AI tools like Github Copilot‚ promise an &amp;quot;AI pair programmer that offers autocomplete-style suggestions as you code&amp;quot;. For the first time, we'll show a native integration of Copilot into RStudio, helping to build on that promise by providing AI-generated &amp;quot;ghost text&amp;quot; autocompletion with R and other languages. I'll also provide a comparison of Copilot's &amp;quot;ghost text&amp;quot; to a chat-style interface in RStudio via the {chattr} package from the Posit MLVerse team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the most of these new features, I'll walk through some examples of how sharing additional context, comments, code, and other &amp;quot;prompt engineering&amp;quot; can help you go from code-generating AI tools that feels like an annoying backseat driver to an experienced copilot. We'll close with a robust end-to-end example of how these new RStudio integrations and packages can help you be a more productive developer.&lt;/p&gt;

This new IDE is an extensible tool built to facilitate exploratory data analysis, reproducible authoring, and publishing data artifacts. Positron currently supports these data workflows in either or both Python and R and is designed with a forward-looking architecture that can support other data science languages in the future. In this session, learn from the team-building Positron about how and why it is designed the way it is, what will feel familiar or new coming from other IDEs, and whether it might be a good fit for your own work.&lt;/p&gt;
