writing mistakes, including spelling and grammar errors. However, very
rarely these tools are used by school teachers. For most of them, it is
still time- consuming and tedious to correct (beginners) student essays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce some challenges in automatic English text
correction. The objective is to present how it is possible to use Python
libraries (scikit-learn, SciPy and NumPy) for spotting English mistakes
such as: articles, capitalization and spelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to train and test the classifier, an open dataset will be used:
EF- Cambridge Open Language Dataset
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://corpus.mml.cam.ac.uk/efcamdat/"&gt;https://corpus.mml.cam.ac.uk/efcamdat/&lt;/a&gt;). This will allow participants
to reproduce all the steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the presentation, the accuracy of the implementation will be
compared to at least one commercial application. It will be discussed
how this kind of work can bring value to existing educational
applications. Limitations and further steps will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation is a successive work from the cooperation of Education
First (language teaching institution) engineers and University of
Cambridge language researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
