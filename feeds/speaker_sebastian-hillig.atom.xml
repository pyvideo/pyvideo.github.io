building than obsessing over formatting and other easily correctable
issues in your and others code. Probably some analysis of how often
styling/pep8 is mentioned in Python PRs and code reviews...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastian Hillig is a software engineer at Artory, a New York/Berlin
company that is working to bring more transparency to the art market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In true startup fashion, he wears many hats, including the ones of
product owner, engineering team lead and smoothie happiness supplier.
With more than a decade of professional experience working on
software, Python has been a stable companion while product and
accompanying languages have been in a constant state of flux: VoIP
monitoring to database prototypes, C++ to Smalltalk, custom websites
to enterprise applications, and compiler benchmarks to user testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good developer experience is one of his pet penchants, improving
anything from environment to tooling. In his free time, Sebastian
practices karate, smashes volleyballs, toys around with new
technologies, and reads about software engineering best practices and
martial arts.&lt;/p&gt;
