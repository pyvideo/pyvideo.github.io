In this talk I'm going to show you how to write an asynchronous web application using Flask.&lt;/p&gt;

exclusively on top of WebSocket, without using HTTP at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the benefit of using WebSocket over HTTP, you may ask? With
WebSocket each client establishes a permanent connection to the server,
so there is no request/response cycle and no need for the client to poll
the server for data. Each side can freely send data to the other side at
any time, so this is an ideal stack for building highly dynamic,
event-driven applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this live coding exercise I'm going to use the Socket.IO server for
Python, and the Socket.IO client for JavaScript. No Flask, no Django, no
HTTP!&lt;/p&gt;

While Miguel Grinberg is a big fan of personal projects, his reasons are completely different. He hopes to convince you to start a personal project of your own after giving you a fresh perspective on this practice.&lt;/p&gt;

They all give you secret keys to authenticate with. Did you ever commit one of these to source control by mistake? That happened to me more times than I'm willing to admit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'm going to go over the best practices to follow when when writing Python applications that prevent this type of accident.&lt;/p&gt;

Paired with a high-level protocol such as Socket.IO, you get a powerful and easy to use framework for bi-directional, low latency communication, with clients available for Python, JavaScript, Java, iOS, Android, C++, .Net and more. Flask is a lightweight and very popular web framework for Python that makes writing web servers easy and fun, without sacrificing any power. What happens when you combine WebSocket, Socket.IO and Flask? In this talk I'm going to show you some of the cool applications that you can build when these technologies are put to work together, including streaming audio and video, real-time sensor data, automatic voting and more!&lt;/p&gt;

are the core ideas behind microservices, what problems they try to
solve, and what are the viable options to implement them in Python,
both from technical and teamwork point of views. Some of the topics
that will be discussed include the role of APIs, the improvements
microservices bring to application scalability, upgrades, and
maintenance, and the challenges in breaking up a monolithic
application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will leave the talk with a good idea of what microservices
are, and how they help build better applications. As usual with my
presentations, there will be actual code examples presented during
the talk that I will also host on GitHub, for those interested in
investigating further on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

lots of people talking about asynchronous programming, most in a
favorable way, some not so much. In this talk, I will tell you what this
async fever is about and what can it do for you that regular Python
can't, not only with asyncio, but also with other frameworks that
existed long before it.&lt;/p&gt;

such, they have a cloud of hype surrounding them that makes it hard to
separate substance from fluff. In this tutorial, Miguel Grinberg starts
with an introduction to this architecture, including what's great and
not so great about it, and then teaches you how a traditional monolithic
application written in Flask can be refactored into a modern distributed
system based on microservices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think that because Flask is a micro-framework, it must only be good for small, toy-like web applications? Well, not at all! In this tutorial I am going to show you a few patterns and best practices that can take your Flask application to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

intentions. It is considered a micro-framework, but don't get the
&amp;quot;micro&amp;quot; part fool you; Flask can do everything the &amp;quot;others&amp;quot; can do, many
times in a simpler, leaner way. This session will introduce you to Flask
as an engine to build RESTful web services.&lt;/p&gt;

APIs to violate one or more of the REST architectural principles. In
this talk I will describe the six REST principles, and I will tell you
what happens if you don't follow them.&lt;/p&gt;
