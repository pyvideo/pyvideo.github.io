&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profiling is hard. Trying to understand what is making your system slow
can be very frustrating. Specially when it happens only when your
clients are looking, but not you. Python comes with elaborate profiling
tools, but understanding the output of profile/cProfile can be a
daunting task, specially on complex frameworks, and these modules might
be impractical in a production environment where their performance toll
can make the system unusable. But Python is a very reflexive language,
allowing extensive investigation of its own state during runtime, and
one of its lesser known tools is the sys.&lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt;frames() function.
It can be used to take an X-ray of what all the threads in your running
Python program are doing. It can also be used for a kind of
“statistical” profiling, with little impact on your running system. In
this talk we’ll investigate how this function can be used to tell what
your program is doing, exactly at the moment when it is misbehaving.
We’ll learn how looking at a series of tracebacks, instead of a bunch of
calling statistics, can help zooming quickly into code hot spots. We’ll
also show some case studies of real world server-side slowdowns that
were solved by the use of this technique which were caused by complex
interactions of different components, including a case where a serious
performance issue was diagnosed in a production deployment of ERP5 in a
corporate client of Nexedi’s.&lt;/p&gt;
