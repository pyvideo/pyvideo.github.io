The goal of this talk is to move quickly beyond the basics, and explore larger questions of how to build a sane and scalable service that your users will love. We will draw on our own experience of implementing bad (and later, less-bad) answers to these questions in multiple real-world situations, with specific examples demonstrated using Django REST Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
