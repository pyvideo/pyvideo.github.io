Dumpster was designed to increase efficiency, study waste patterns, and
improve refuse reduction. Using Python, a prototype has been installed
into operations with tentative success since July 2013. Demonstrating
real-time data reporting, the talk will focus on the success, roadblocks
and campus plans for the Smart Dumpster.&lt;/p&gt;
