&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest problems for any project is trying to understand and deliver functionality that the user was requesting.
Language, knowledge and communication differences can often times present an almost insurmountable barrier. Making this one of the most difficult and frustrating parts of any project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behaviour Driven Design can help us toshorten the feedback loop between you and your user and get you both talking on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also discover how this can lead to better delivery, technical documentation, code quality and serve as an accompaniment to Test Driven Development.&lt;/p&gt;
