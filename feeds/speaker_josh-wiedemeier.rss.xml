and payloads as Python bytecode (.pyc) files, often thinking that their
secret logic will be unreadable by humans. Using a simple example, we
will teach curious developers how to interpret and decompile Python
bytecode by hand. Finally, we will discuss challenges and solutions of
automating Python decompilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is targeted towards intrepid intermediate Python developers
who are looking to take a look under the hood, and reverse engineers who
are looking to add Python binaries to their repertoire. Unlike previous
bytecode-oriented talks at PyCon, which primarily focus on Python's
execution model, this talk is primarily interested in recovering Python
source code from Python bytecode.&lt;/p&gt;
