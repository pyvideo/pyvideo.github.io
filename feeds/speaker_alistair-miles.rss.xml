In this talk we introduce pymcmcstat [Miles, 2018], which utilizes the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) algorithm [Haario et al., 2006, Haario et al., 2001] to perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. The user interface provides a straight forward environment for experienced and new Python users to quickly compare their models with data. Furthermore, the package provides a wide variety of diagnostic tools for visualizing uncertainty propagation. This package has been utilized in a wide array of scientific and engineering problems, including radiation source localization and constitutive model development of smart material systems.&lt;/p&gt;

The Zarr project is developing a simple, scalable approach to storage of such data in a way that is compatible with a range of approaches to distributed and parallel computing. We describe the Zarr protocol and data storage format, and the current state of implementations for various programming languages including Python. We also describe current uses of Zarr in malaria genomics, the Human Cell Atlas, and the Pangeo project.&lt;/p&gt;
