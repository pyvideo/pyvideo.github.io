soldering iron and some basic Python skills can take everyday objects
and transform them into fully networked, smart devices. In this talk, I
will show you how I hacked a Raspberry Pi into my home alarm system,
turning my network of IP cameras into motion triggered sensors. I will
show you how to build basic input and output circuits and introduce you
to the RPi.GPIO Python module. Weâ€™ll talk about how you can build a
RESTful server on your Raspberry Pi to enable remote access. And
finally, more ideas for hacking everyday objects around the home! No
prior electronics knowledge required.&lt;/p&gt;
