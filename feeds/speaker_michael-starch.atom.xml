From early development through operations, the Python programming language had a big impact on the success of the mission through its use in code generation, validation, and big data management. We will discuss this impact as well as Python’s continued application to missions following in Ingenuity’s footsteps. Michael graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In his free time, Michael mentors students at a local high school, helps organize local technical organizations, and loves to talk anything tech.&lt;/p&gt;
