and the innovative -- on doing things differently from how they’ve been
done. The assumption is that newer is (almost) always better. But if we
look only to the present and the future, we risk reinventing the wheel,
failing to understand that we are all built on tradition, failing to
learn everything that we could from the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk shows how documentarians can find inspiration in the past,
build on it, and move forward. It tells some of these stories, and shows
what they meant in historical context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pre-history and dawn of software documentation -- how technical
writers were hired, how they worked, what they made, the challenges
they faced, and how their solutions continue to inform the work we do
today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The much longer history of teaching engineers to write documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efforts to make technical writing into an independent profession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

assigned (harried and inaccessible subject matter experts, barely
functioning builds, sketchy doc infrastructure, etc.). But there are
also the obstacles that keep us from writing the docs we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;, and
those are largely ingrained in our companies' processes and our own
heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pay lip service to &amp;quot;the user&amp;quot; but then subordinate that to concerns
of structure, consistency, and stylistic conventions. The result is
often docs that are internally consistent and satisfy the editorial,
translation, and production teams for their economy and re-usability but
are so dry and product-centered that they fail to connect with the most
important audience - actual human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I'll talk about ways to overcome burdensome
organizational processes and our own timidity to create room for the
inspiration and creativity needed to bring the docs' subject alive.&lt;/p&gt;

contracts can be consumed programmatically and adapted easily into our
codebases. Other tools like JSON Schema also contribute to this idea of
integration between service and client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about our documentation? If API contracts can be assimilated
into software, surely it can drive our documentation too? In this talk,
I want to introduce some of the techniques I've used on past projects
that allow exactly that. By using remote schemas to generate software,
it also allows us to generate working documentation that is always
relevant and never out of date. Apart from accuracy, we also get the
added benefits of reduced development time, reduced effort, and reduced
duplication. We can all of this by documenting once, and re-using across
multiple projects!&lt;/p&gt;

have to deal with email almost every single day. Fortunately we can
improve email as a whole by learning how to write email that sucks just
a little bit less -- not that you write bad emails.. this talk is for
your... friend. Yeah, this talk is for your friends that really need to
setup up their email game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to email this talk will explore some fundamental
misunderstandings that people have with modes of online communication
and how to correct these misunderstandings. Like how to craft a good
Tweet, Facebook Post, and Instant Messaging interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be a tutorial but rather a conceptual guide for how
to think about on-line communication and how to correct some common
faults we share as members of the on-line community. The Internet isn't
going away anytime soon, and the amount we communicate over it is not
going to diminish anytime soon either. This talk attempts to teach one
how to make digital communication as painless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

out” and exposed? Imposter syndrome is corrosive. It holds us back at
work - especially in an industry where we can feel constantly under
review by talented peers - and erodes our happiness. And the subject
always comes up whenever technical writers gather; sometimes it feels
like the very definition of a technical writer is “One who experiences
imposter syndrome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this? The first, shorter part of this talk will cover some
research and insights into why we, as documentarians, may be especially
susceptible to imposter syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the field of tech writing is experiencing a swerve: a tipping point
- a sea change in direction. There will always be a demand for &amp;quot;&amp;quot;old&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
tech writing, but many of us will have to adapt to this new environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second, forward-looking part of this talk, I’ll argue that being
an “imposter” has its advantages during such a time of change. The very
factors that contribute to our self-doubt are actually the qualities
that will enable us to thrive as our role inexorably evolves to take on
new, unsolved challenges in engineering information. The keys to our
success: apophenia (the ability to see connections between seemingly
random collections of information), empathy, and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our future is bright if we pay attention to our new opportunities
instead of that nagging voice in our heads.&lt;/p&gt;

is still largely driven by the needs of technical contributors to

&lt;p&gt;Good documentation is a crucial component in a software product and yet
often technical writers are overlooked as important stakeholders of the
process. Within the community, there are undoubtedly common problems
between engineers and technical writers. Software Engineering is full of
laws; can we show that these laws apply to technical writers as a means
to help bridge the chasm between developers and technical writers??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk Paul walks us through a selection of his favourite laws of
software engineering and explores how developers measure them and if
technical writers must also obey them. Or not. And what that means for
the success of documentation in a Free Software project.&lt;/p&gt;

mission- critical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear: the aim here is not to knock professionalism in docs, quite
the contrary! Yet, faced with a lack of resources, 'bend the rules and
get going' sure beats lethargy. Not to mention being fun...&lt;/p&gt;

read my carefully written documentation. While people will read, not
everyone learns by reading the docs. Since my goal is to make sure my
documentation can meet as many learning styles as possible, that has
meant spreading my documentarian wings and bridging out from only
writing the docs into recording them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my documentation journey has been learning how to create
screencasts and I want to share that knowledge with everyone. From
picking the right topics, to outlining, to writing a script (yes I
promise, there is still writing involved), to how to record your audio
and video, I'll cover it all. You don't need to be a professional voice
actor or videographer to create a screencast, even a writer can create
something wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

surely that what you write is correct. That is, the examples you provide
give the output you say they will. Or perhaps it is that the links in
your documentation link to an expected page. Usually this is done with
manual testing at the time of writing. Your organisation may have
practices in place to make sure that these examples don't get too out of
date - maybe someone checks them periodically, maybe code review comes
with comments like &amp;quot;I remember that this part of the code is used in an
example on Page 37 of our docs, change it&amp;quot;. But these methods are
tedious and flawed. This talk will give examples from my work as a
software engineer in creating tested snippets for documentation which
are linked to the code they represent. It will show how using techniques
traditionally reserved for software testing can ease the burden of
keeping documentation up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

involving complex software developed by physicists or chemists. It would
seem that scientists should be well versed in ways of documenting and
explaining their research. Yet, when it comes to the documentation of
scientific software projects, one soon realises that scientific wisdom
is spread mostly by LaTeX and that the word 'documentation' starts to
mean something completely different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a documentation for a scientific project can be quite
challenging. There are not that many examples of well-documented
open-source geoscientific numerical modelling software projects to drew
the inspiration from. Even though the scientific results should be
reproducible, mechanisms that reward those who deliver well documented
software are still to become widespread. The scientists are judged
basing on the number of peer-reviewed papers they publish, therefore
investing the time solely to offer the documentation is difficult. The
documentation should include the actual mathematical equations and
theory behind the software, figures documenting the scientific results
as well as code listings and usage examples. The target audience may
have a strong background in science, computer science, both or neither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly this talk offers an introduction to a variety of established as

explores the question whether or not these approaches can be applied to
software documentation in a reasonable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard it takes a closer look at individual methods and
estimates their corresponding affordances in terms of time, skill,
resources and potential automatization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, this talk presents an initial attempt to translate existing
docs into visual languages and discusses the according outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily, the objective of reading and writing the docs serves the
purpose to convey clear, unambiguous information, at the same time, the
experience should be as engaging and pleasant as possible. Building a
Visual Documentation Language serves to reach this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

“thing”? Whether you ask developers, marketing folks or users, you often
get very different views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with user interfaces, documentation helps all stakeholders align
their mental model of a product. Terminology plays a key role, and a
controlled vocabulary is an ace up the technical writer's sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled vocabularies are basically lists of concepts and the
relationships between them. Beyond consistent naming, they are about
structuring, categorizing and retrieving content. For example, you can
use a vocabulary as a basis for documentation plans, tables of content,
a help site's navigation, search filters, or even to organize test
cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will share ways to create and maintain various types of
vocabularies, and explain what each type is useful for. You can start
with a flat list of terms and expand it into a glossary, a thesaurus, a
taxonomy, or even a full-fledge ontology.&lt;/p&gt;

result, thinking and imagination are suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we can write documentation that encourages thinking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look together on what really matters when documenting computer
systems. We will discuss how a documentation and system design can walk
hand in hand and to improve the communication between both humans and
machines.&lt;/p&gt;
