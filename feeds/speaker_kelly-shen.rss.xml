I will talk about my experience using Julia in a few different projects and why I’ve found Julia an accessible yet special language with a lot of potential. I will also share what I love about the Julia community.&lt;/p&gt;

As our experimentation platform scales and the velocity of experimentation increases rapidly across the company, we also face a number of challenges. In this talk, I will talk about how we utilize Python to investigate and evaluate one of the problems, “peeking” at results early in order to detect maximum significance with minimum sample size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assessed the overall problem and how it affected experiments at Etsy. We then evaluated a few solutions that have been proposed and applied in industry and academia, keeping in mind the unique challenges we face as a fast-paced e-commerce company. After going through the analysis and evaluation, I will discuss the approach we at Etsy took to tackle the peeking problem.&lt;/p&gt;
