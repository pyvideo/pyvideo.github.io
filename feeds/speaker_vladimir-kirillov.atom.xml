However all nasty bugs tend to happen only in production, the very constrained environment without possibilities to edit code, restart, freeze or reconfigure in runtime to suspend services or scare the bug away. This talk is going to cover a set of techniques of debugging, tracing and profiling production Python code in Linux and Solaris environments (with focus on Linux). I'm going to show how to take advantage of GDB, strace, kernel memory, tcpdump, DTrace, SystemTap and all the related software tools to fully introspect what's going on in the Python-powered system.&lt;/p&gt;

there always was a missing thing here and there. Vlad has tried many
languages during his career as an engineer, got excited with a
functional programming community and settled with using Haskell as a
prime-time instrument. Come to the talk to find out what's going on. In
this talk passion is going to be (almost) purely technical and no hello
worlds, promise.&lt;/p&gt;
