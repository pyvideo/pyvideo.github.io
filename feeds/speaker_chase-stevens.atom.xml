&lt;p&gt;This session will introduce attendees to Python’s rich ecosystem of
abstract syntax tree tooling and libraries, with an emphasis on
practical applications in static analysis and metaprogramming. Attendees
should be fully comfortable with Python syntax and semantics, but
familiarity with the ast module itself will not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will begin with a conceptual overview of ASTs, including a
brief look at Python’s built-in introspection capabilities. It will
introduce tools for AST visualization (astor, showast,
python-ast-explorer), creation (asttools, meta), and transformation to
source code (codegen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the AST can be used for static analysis will be covered; this will
include discussion of Python’s built-in facilities (NodeVisitor) as well
as of the 3rd party tools astsearch, astpath, and bellybutton. The talk
will demonstrate the advantages and limits of these tools in comparison
to other static analysis tooling (pylint, mypy); particular attention
will be paid to how these tools can be incorporated into attendees’
workflows and existing codebases and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tooling for Python AST manipulation and metaprogramming will be the
final topic covered, focusing on the use of the NodeTransformer
built-in. The talk will cover practical applications and examples of
metaprogramming, such as metaprogramming for DSLS (pony, xpyth), runtime
code manipulation (patterns, yield-from), and others (e.g. assertion
rewriting in pytest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the talk will touch only briefly on each of the applications
discussed, by the end of the session attendees should have a firm grasp
of the kinds of problems the AST can be used to solve, what existing AST
tooling can accomplish, and what resources are available for the
development of their own AST tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, I'll discuss the infrastructure and tooling my small team of data science practitioners and engineers is using to manage and orchestrate the machine learning model lifecycle, including pitfalls we've encountered along the way. Particular attention will be paid to where we've opted to use off-the-shelf solutions versus developing our own, the importance of developer ergonomics, and how to maximally empower data scientists to get their work into production without the need for a dedicated MLOps team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover our ML stack as it exists in production today, and will touch on our application of a number of technologies and techniques, including:
- AWS SageMaker
- Airflow
- Docker
- Cookiecutter
- Property-based testing
- Jsonschema
- Linting
- Slack integration
- Model artifacts and diagnostics
- Automated deployments and rollbacks
- Healthchecks
- Autoscaling
- DBT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the session, attendees should expect to leave with new insights that they can apply immediately to their own ML systems and infrastructure, as well as a better understanding of how to minimize engineering and ops overhead, in the real world, across data science teams of any size and composition.&lt;/p&gt;
