In this talk, we will introduce the library and its features for working with Kafka queues in Python. We will discuss the motivations for creating the library, how it compares to other Kafka client libraries, and how to use its decorators to define functions for consuming and producing messages. We will also demonstrate how to use these functions to build a simple application that sends and receives messages from the queue. This talk will be of interest to Python developers looking for an easy-to-use solution for working with Kafka.&lt;/p&gt;
