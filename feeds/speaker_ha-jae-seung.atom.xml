I will share the details of adding necessary functions that were not in the engine while making an indie game called &amp;quot;Illusion&amp;quot; using Ren'Py. I implemented a timeline function that shows the choices made by the player while playing the game and allows them to try different choices. I implemented a function that downloads and updates DLC or updated information through the server. I will explain what I considered and how I collaborated while making these functions. (It does not cover how to make a game with Ren'Py or modifying the GUI.)&lt;/p&gt;
