When should it defer to a human to evaluate? How much risk is reasonable? Through the lens of Bayesian Neural Networks, we will show how to measure model uncertainty in Deep Learning models in practical settings, with immediate applications to active sampling and reinforcement learning&lt;/p&gt;

I will share some technical examples in recent developments (for example Bayesian Neural Networks using Edward) but more importantly I hope to trigger the audience to start thinking strategically about how we want our machine learning models to learn from new data.&lt;/p&gt;
