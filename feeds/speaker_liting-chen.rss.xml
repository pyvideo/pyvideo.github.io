&lt;p&gt;The genome in every cell contains enormous information on how the cell would behalf. The difference between each genome results in various phenotypes. In this talk, I would first showcase how did we use python modules to extract information across different single-cell genome sequencing information from sparse and erroneous raw data. Secondly, I would demo example graphs where Python module seaborn and matplotlib aid creating novel and informative representation.&lt;/p&gt;
