experience to end users. This opens a way to use human voice as
input/output for you applications. You can easily create
voice-controlled applications (called Alexa skills) or just voice
interface for your current products or anything you like! Tools provided
by Amazon web services (AWS) are easy to use and if used correctly, then
completely free. Once skill is done, it’s just a matter of minutes to
deploy it as high-available, auto-scaled, serverless, globally
distributed application using AWS. Then you can use Amazon Alexa Skill
store to sell your product all over the world. I would like to show you
how it works, what AWS provides to developers and how can anybody create
Alexa skills using your favorite language – Python.&lt;/p&gt;
