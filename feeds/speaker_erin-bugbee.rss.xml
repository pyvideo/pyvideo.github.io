As a decision scientist, I aim to understand these choices and the cognitive processes underlying them. In my talk, I'll delve into how I leverage both R and Python to decode human decision-making. I'll focus on optimal stopping problems, a common predicament we all encounter, in which a decision-maker must determine the right moment to stop exploring options and make a choice based on their accumulated knowledge. Attendees will be introduced to the field of decision science and learn how R and Python can assist in advancing the study of the human mind.&lt;/p&gt;
