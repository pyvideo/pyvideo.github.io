&lt;p&gt;Signing up is on a first-come-first-served basis. The queue is reset every day in the morning.
You may talk about / present (almost) everything with certain boundaries:
- no promotion for products of companies, no call for 'we are hiring' (but you may name your employer).
- conference announcements are limited to one minute only
- one LT per person per conference policy: everyone who has not given an LT at this year's conference, yet, is ahead of you in the queue
- keep it short, the shorter the presentations, the more people can give a talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Liffey B on 2022-07-13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital audio has been around for 40 years, but working with audio data can still be complicated, especially in Python. In this talk, we'll talk about how digital audio works from the ground up (from sounds, to bytes, to files), how you can use Python to do a bunch of really neat things with audio, and how a new Python library - Pedalboard - helps make working with audio much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever used a digital audio workstation (DAW) like GarageBand, Ableton Live, Logic, or Pro Tools? Today's musicians use DAWs as instruments in themselves. But what if you want to combine the power of a DAW with the flexibility of writing your own code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedalboard was built to fill this niche: to pull the power of a DAW into your Python code. Pedalboard makes it easy to build and apply audio effects, read and write audio files, and load audio plug-ins (&amp;quot;&amp;quot;VSTs&amp;quot;&amp;quot;) without any complicated dependencies or frameworks. Just &lt;cite&gt;import pedalboard&lt;/cite&gt; and go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python can do (nearly) anything, but using Python to work with audio has always been a complicated and messy affair. In this talk, we'll be going through how digital audio works, how Python can be used to play with audio data, and how a new library - Pedalboard - can help. Pedalboard is a simple, fast, and performant library for doing common audio tasks in Python, including applying effects, using VSTs and audio plugins, and encoding/decoding various audio formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaker: Peter Sobot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter is a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Spotify in New York, where he helps lead their Audio Intelligence Lab - a machine learning research lab dedicated to pushing the state of the art in audio-based machine learning. He's secretly Canadian (howdy neighbour!) and when not hacking on audio software, he plays drums and bass in a handful of bands.&lt;/p&gt;
