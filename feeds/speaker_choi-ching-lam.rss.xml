&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will introduce my open source Python project, Corona-Net, COVID-19 chest CT segmentation  with PyTorch. I leverage the EfficientNet model for image-level COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the UNet -- a Fully Convolutional encoder-decoder network -- for binary and multi-class medical segmentation. Through UNet, I successfully detect and localise COVID-19 symptoms, including ground-glass, consolidation and pleural effusion, from axial chest CT slices, using open source datasets and annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
