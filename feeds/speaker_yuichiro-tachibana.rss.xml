It greatly simplifies handling interactivity, UI design, and some other difficulties in web development, for example by introducing a unique execution model and limiting the design/layout flexibility.
So sometimes we should be aware of its such characteristics and limitations in order to use it effectively.
In this talk, I will review Streamlit's features, discuss its pros and cons compared to other pure-Python web UI frameworks based on concrete examples, and suggest alternatives for some use cases where Streamlit is not the best fit.&lt;/p&gt;
