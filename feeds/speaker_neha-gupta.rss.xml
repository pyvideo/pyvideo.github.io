build self-confidence, and help bridge the gender gap in tech. This talk
offers solutions to common challenges in motivating students and
community organizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will share methods to increase student engagement and aid the
transition to Python. We used “Unplugged” activities that complement
programming fundamentals, “block-based” logic in Scratch, and the
drag-to-text Python platform in Codesters. We will also share examples
of leading discussions that build girls’ curiosity about technology
fields, including learning about role models of top women in the
industry, and learning about emerging areas in technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, organizing clubs for students from diverse backgrounds,
with varying technical educations, can involve bridging gaps and
encouraging community involvement. We’ll discuss methods of reaching
families and local communities, such as open presentations,
celebrations, and share some do's and don'ts from our experiences. We’ll
also share ways to encourage participants to develop communication
skills about their technical work and teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women’s rights and community activism are gathering national attention,
and we believe that anyone can effectively run an ongoing coding club to
positively impact girls' education in their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

Questions of robust causal inference are unavoidable in health or social science settings, where available data is observational, meaning we only observe one outcome per individual. One common approach to causal inference is to match each treatment unit to an identical control unit with all the same characteristics. Exact matching is not possible for high dimensional datasets. So, for the best possible alternative, we introduce the dame-flame matching library for discrete datasets, and show the matches are high quality and interpretable.&lt;/p&gt;
