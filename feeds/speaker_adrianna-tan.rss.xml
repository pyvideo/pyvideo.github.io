&lt;p&gt;Like many young and ambitious people in the late 00s and early 10s, Adrianna thought that tech would change the world. It did, but in which direction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running startups, working at startups, working on open source, working in government, Adrianna is now making waves doing tech at.. an aquarium. For the last 12 years, she has also been the cofounder of an Indian nonprofit that works to teach Scratch and Python programming skills to underprivileged children in Mumbai and Pune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, she’s learned a few things about what technology can and cannot do. She’s now interested in what happens when computers happen to people, most just in computers alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come hear about her journey, and how she still hopes that computers can bring joy to people.&lt;/p&gt;
