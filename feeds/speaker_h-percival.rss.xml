come prepared! you’ll need git, firefox, python2.7, django1.4 and
selenium installed. Fully Test-Driven Django with Selenium AKA “The
Django Pony vs The Testing Goat” This tutorial is aimed primarily at
people who want to learn about one or many of: Django Selenium
Test-Driven-Development So it’s aimed at beginners of one kind or
another – if you are already well versed in all three, then you may not
get much out of it. The idea is to run through the steps covered by the
official Django tutorial, covering the essentials of Django from a
beginner’s point of view. However, at each stage, instead of “just”
writing the Django code required to build our site, we first write
tests. And we don’t just write unit tests! We start by writing
“functional” or “acceptance” tests, using Selenium - which means driving
a real browser, and checking the actual behaviour of the site as it is
rendered, from the user’s point of view. Why should you listen to me, I
hear you ask? Well, I was lucky enough to get my first “proper” software
development job about two years ago with a bunch of Extreme Programming
fanatics, who’ve thoroughly inculcated me into their cult of Test-Driven
development. Believe me when I say I’m contrary enough to have
questioned every single practice, challenged every single decision,
moaned about every extra minute spent doing “pointless” tests instead of
writing “proper” code. But I’ve come round to the idea now, and whenever
I’ve had to go back to some of my old projects which don’t have tests,
boy have I ever realised the wisdom of the approach. So, I’ve learnt
from some really good people, and the learning process is still fresh in
my mind, and most importantly, I still have the passion of a recent
convert! Pre-requisites Come with the following pre- installed on your
laptop please: Git Firefox Python 2.7 setuptools/easy_install/pip then:
pip install django pip install selenium pip install mock PS - I don’t
have a preview of my TDD talk, but there is one video of me giving a
lightning talk at last year’s Pycon UK. It’s on a totally different
topic, but it gives a hit of my “dynamic” presentation “skills&amp;quot;: -
