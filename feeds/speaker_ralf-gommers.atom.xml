the cornerstones of the scientific Python ecosystem, and it recently had
a milestone 1.0 release. In this talk I'd like to explore the road to
that 1.0 release, as well as some questions and ideas about what's next
for the project and community. How do we grow and sustain the project in
the future? What is happening around sustainability of projects in the
ecosystem? And what does this mean for users and aspiring
contributors?Presenter(s): Speaker: Ralf Gommers, FP Innovations, Scion&lt;/p&gt;

NumPy developers think it has invigorated the project and its community. But is that true, and how can we know? We will give an overview of the actions we've taken to improve the sustainability of the NumPy project and its community. We will draw some lessons from a first year of grant-funded activity, discuss key obstacles faced, attempt to quantify what we need to operate sustainably, and present a vision for the project and how we plan to realize it.&lt;/p&gt;
