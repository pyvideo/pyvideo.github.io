and run distributed applications. This allows for rapidly deployable
apps, which will run on any docker environment with the ability to
rapidly scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Docker is based on Linux containers, these are very lightweight and
allow resource isolation. With added tools to provide workflow
automation and image management, Docker can provide a complete toolset
to manage your application environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aimed at newcomers to the technology, this talk will cover the basics of
what Docker is, how it compares to other technologies and with why it's
useful for Python applications. There will be practical demos and
examples of real world Python deployments included.&lt;/p&gt;
