Ajinkya More | Resampling techniques and other strategies for handling highly unbalanced datasets in classification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many real world machine learning problems need to deal with imbalanced class distribution i.e. when one class has significantly higher/lower representation than the other classes. Often performance on the minority class is more crucial, e.g. fraud detection, product classification, medical diagnosis, etc. In this talk I will discuss several techniques to handle class imbalance in classification.&lt;/p&gt;
