C++ is great
for performance-critical calculations, while Python is great for
everything else. In this tutorial we’ll look at how to integrate Python
and C++ using the Boost.Python library. You’ll learn techniques for
easily developing hybrid systems that use the right language for the
right task, resulting in better software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python and C++ are both popular languages that each bring a lot to the
table. The languages also complement one another well: Python is
high-level, dynamic, and easy to use while C++ is at-the-metal, static,
and (in)famously tricky. There are times when there are real advantages
to combining these disparate natures, and Python’s C API provides a
strong interface for doing just that. Boost.Python is a C++ library that
builds upon and improves Python’s C API to give users a simpler, more
intuitive, and safer means to integrate Python and C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we’ll look at how to use Boost.Python to effectively
bridge the Python/C++ boundary. We’ll start by briefly looking at the
fundamentals of the Python C API since that defines the “ground rules”;
this includes things like reference counting, the basic object model,
and so forth. We’ll then quickly look at the Boost.Python API and show
how it provides the same functionality as the underlying C API, but does
so in a way that doesn’t obscure the real semantics of the Python
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this introduction, the rest of the tutorial will involve writing
code to explore various elements of Boost.Python. We’ll focus on
techniques for extending Python with C++, that is, writing Python
modules in C++. Boost.Python can be used for embedding (i.e. invoking
Python code from C++), but that involves a different set of techniques,
and in practice most scientific Python developers are more interested in
developing extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syllabus for the four-hour tutorial will be like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Introduction: C-API and Boost.Python basics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this can be reduced or eliminated of participants are
already comfortable with the topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Hello World: Exposing a basic function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section we’ll get a minimal Boost.Python module working. This
will not only introduce students to the infrastructure of
Boost.Python, but it will also give us a chance to make sure that
everyone’s build environment is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Exposing functions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section we’ll look at the details of exposing C++ functions
to Python. The topics we’ll cover will include overloading (including
Boost.Python’s auto-overload feature), default argument values, and a
brief look at call policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Exposing classes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we’ll look at how to expose C++ classes to Python. Topics will
include the basic &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;class_&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; template, member functions, data
members, properties, inheritance, and virtual functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;boost::python::object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;boost::python::object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; class is Boost.Python’s primary
interface to Python’s &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;PyObject&lt;/tt&gt; structure. Understanding how to
work with this class is a key building-block for developing Python
modules with Boost.Python. We’ll explore its API and features,
including areas like attribute access, reference counting, and
converting between Python and C++ objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Derived object types&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boost.Python provides a number of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;boost::python::object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
subclasses for important Python classes like &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;list&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;dict&lt;/tt&gt;, and
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;tuple&lt;/tt&gt;. In this section we’ll look at these subclasses and how to
use them in Boost.Python modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Enums&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boost.Python provides &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;enum_&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; for exposing C++ enums to Python.
Python doesn’t have a notion of enums &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, but in this section
we’ll explore how this template makes it straightforward to use C++
enums in Python in a simple and intuitive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Type conversion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section we’ll look at Boost.Python’s support for doing
automatic type-conversion across the Python/C++ boundary. We’ll see
how you can register type-converters with Boost.Python which will be
invoked whenever Boost.Python needs to convert a Python object to a
C++ object or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly ambitious set of topics, and it’s possible that we
won’t be able to cover them all. The topics are roughly in
most-often-used to least-often-used order, however, so students will be
sure to be exposed to the most important and relevant elements of the
course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the four-hour format of the course means that we won’t be able
to go into great depth on many topics. The main goal of the course,
then, is to give students enough orientation and hands-on experience
with Boost.Python that they can continue to learn on their own.
Inter-language integration - especially between languages as dissimilar
as C++ and Python - can be quite complex, but this tutorial will give
students the grounding they need to successfully apply Boost.Python to
their problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly ambitious set of topics, and it’s possible that we
won’t be able to cover them all. The topics are roughly in
most-often-used to least-often-used order, however, so students will be
sure to be exposed to the most important and relevant elements of the
course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the four-hour format of the course means that we won’t be able
to go into great depth on many topics. The main goal of the course,
then, is to give students enough orientation and hands-on experience
with Boost.Python that they can continue to learn on their own.
Inter-language integration - especially between languages as dissimilar
as C++ and Python - can be quite complex, but this tutorial will give
students the grounding they need to successfully apply Boost.Python to
their problems.&lt;/p&gt;
