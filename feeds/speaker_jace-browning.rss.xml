Maybe itâ€™s time to start investing in a suite of end-to-end regression
tests. In this talk we'll explore practical examples of developing
automated tests using Selenium (via Splinter) and exploratory testing
using Jupyter sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

program configuration and/or data in version control. YORM was born to

object attributes to YAML files. In order to explain the inner-workings
of this library, I'll be diving into some of the less common features of
Python that I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
