Developers need accurate, relevant data to safely experiment when building applications, machine learning models, testing, etc. However, developers often run into issues gathering data, from a lack of data to the inability to access the data due to privacy policies. But what if you could have instant access to an unlimited supply of high-fidelity data that’s statistically accurate, privacy-protected, and safe to share? This is where Synthetic Data comes in. In this talk, you'll learn about Synthetic Data, the problems it solves, and how to get started generating as much relevant data as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll discuss what Synthetic Data is, the benefits of using Synthetic Data, and the efficacy of it. You'll see real-world situations where Synthetic Data removes bias, augments data sets, and makes once private data easily shareable while still protecting the privacy of the initial data set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise why many of us are so enamored with Python. Its simplicity, accessibility, and community make it a prime choice for many projects. However, not all software engineering shops use Python, maybe even some of the jobs you work at. Introducing Python to your company and building a Pythonic culture from the ground up is no small task, but it can be done. Join me as I take you through the journey of getting Python from zero to hero within my previous company. I’ll share the experience from start to finish, including what worked, what didn’t, what I would have done differently, and how I evangelized Python to bring it to be a supported language within my company’s ecosystem. Viewers will leave having learned from my experiences—both successes and mistakes—and with a solid plan for implementing Python at their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of that feeling you get when you follow an online tutorial or documentation and the code works on the first run. Now think of all the hours spent wasted following broken, outdated, or incomplete documentation. From our favorite tutorials to bad product docs we all consume technical writing. Tutorials, blog posts, and product docs help developers learn new things, build projects, and debug issues. But what makes one tutorial better than another? In this talk I'll discuss how you can write the documentation that developers love and I’ll share 10 tips and tricks to improve your technical writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project documentation is easy to neglect. Keep your docs inside your

&lt;p&gt;# Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common for developers to overlook the documentation of their
works. They are either on a time crunch, lack the proper tooling, or
simply just forget to create and update the documentation. Whatever the
cause behind this, it is not a proper excuse for not keeping the
documentation up to date. However, for all our development processes
there are few as neglected as the documentation process. Documentation
should be treated as important as the code that makes up the project.
So, let’s move the documentation into the code. With modern
documentation tools such as MkDocs and Sphinx, both of which are Python
powered tools, and Continuous Integration tools we can now include docs
in the commit. They can be reviewed in code reviews, built and versioned
in a CI tool, and even tested for things such as correct code examples
and broken links. This is the process that the developer knows,
understands, and enjoys. I introduced a team to this exact workflow and
a working pipeline; all they had to do was keep the documentation up to
date. This team currently has some of the most up to date documentation
in a company of near two thousand engineers, and they never complain
about writing/updating documentation. It’s just part of the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

having learned from my experiences—both successes and mistakes—and with
a solid plan for implementing Python at their job.&lt;/p&gt;

testing, access to accurate data is one of the biggest bottlenecks
hindering development. Developers need accurate, relevant data to safely
experiment when building applications, machine learning models, testing,
etc. However, developers often run into issues gathering data, from a
lack of data to the inability to access the data due to privacy
policies. But what if you could have instant access to an unlimited
supply of high-fidelity data that’s statistically accurate,
privacy-protected, and safe to share? This is where Synthetic Data comes
in. In this talk, you'll learn about Synthetic Data, the problems it
solves, and how to get started generating as much relevant data as you
want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll discuss what Synthetic Data is, the benefits of
using Synthetic Data, and the efficacy of it. You'll see real-world
situations where Synthetic Data removes bias, augments data sets, and
makes once private data easily shareable while still protecting the
privacy of the initial data set.&lt;/p&gt;
