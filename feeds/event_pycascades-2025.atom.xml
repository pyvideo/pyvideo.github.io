For a career data engineer, this tool has been central in my success at orchestrating and maintaining data pipelines. But Airflow's applications have grown far beyond the intent for which it was originally built. What was once a machine learning training engine is now a tool I've used extensively over the last 8 years. I've used it across 4 jobs, in several different roles; for side projects and critical infrastructure; for manually triggered jobs and automated workflows; for IT (Ookla/Speedtest.net), science (Allen Institute for Cell Science), the commons (Openverse), the future (Babylist), and liberation (Orca Collective). In this talk, I'll be sharing a brief overview of what Apache Airflow is and how it might be able to help manage your workflows too! As an Airflow user and contributor for the last 8 years, I've seen how this tool can quickly become the hammer for every nail you see. Part of what makes Airflow powerful is that you can define its workflows in pure Python; this means you can leverage all of the clever language features and libraries Python has to offer when setting up a job. No more pesky and repetitive YAML files (GitHub Actions) or domain-specific languages (Jenkins). Use the language and libraries you're familiar with while getting automatic retries, error handling, control flow, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will explore the difference between simply having or joining a tech community and ensuring it is visible or you are visible and making impact. Drawing from my experiences in tech communities, especially those focused on gender inclusion, we’ll discuss strategies for amplifying voices, fostering meaningful engagement, and driving tangible outcomes. Attendees will gain insights on leveraging their tech communities to enhance visibility and learn actionable steps to ensure their efforts go beyond internal circles, reaching a broader audience and creating lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s frustrating, right? As users, we feel the inconvenience immediately. To prevent these disruptions, engineering teams rely on various tools and practices to address unexpected system behavior. In today’s distributed world, applications are often segmented into microservices to improve agility and performance. This also brings added complexity, with more opportunities for things to go wrong - errors, latency and more. In this dynamic landscape, observability has evolved from a mere buzzword into a crucial approach for modern reliable systems. We initially gravitate towards a tool for its ease of use, but later after investing significant amount of time and finances, if we choose to migrate, vendor lock-in becomes a major concern. This is where the importance of open standards like OpenTelemetry become essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many think of observability as solely an issue for SREs, but it’s increasingly a developer concern. During this session, we’ll explore why observability matters and how it is evolved over the years. We'll cover how to instrument Python code, process telemetry data and export it seamlessly for analysis. Attendees will leave with a clearer understanding of how observability increases confidence in managing complex systems and how adopting open standards improve the overall developer experience. Let’s work together to redefine OSS observability, as a shared responsibility through collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore Reproducible Builds by highlighting issues identified in Python projects, from the simple to the seemingly inscrutible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reproducible Builds is basically the crazy idea that when you build something, and you build it again, you get the exact same thing... or even more important, if someone else builds it, they get the exact same thing too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a few code examples demonstrating common problems folks will learn what to watch out for when coding and how to fix them once identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the useful tooling for diagnosing and troubleshooting reproducibility issues (diffoscope and reprotest)... just so happen to be written in Python! Will even show you how to use them... and maybe take a look inside.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the years I have produced diagrams, charts, illustrations and other graphics to help people understand sophisticated project concepts. This includes project architecture, standard operating procedures, coding concepts, sprints and roadmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be guided through ways of how to make stylized examples of your project code and workflows in easy to follow examples. By using common software for illustrations along with some simple guidelines you too can make easy to follow visual content for your next project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand how to make your technical documentation into visual graphics with diagram design style guides&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See examples of how to take technical documentation and create an intuitive diagram of it to share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come away with an ability to execute a simple (or sophisticated) graphic with essential steps and key requirements&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, we'll explore two easy ways to create web maps using Python: Streamlit and PyScript. We'll build a web app that helps you find the perfect hiking trail in Washington state, and in the process, learn how to integrate geographic data, visualize it interactively, and deploy it to the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each tool offers a unique approach to building interactive maps. With Streamlit, you’ll see how simple it is to set up a dashboard (that includes maps) with minimal code. Then, we’ll dive into PyScript, which enables you to run Python directly in the browser, allowing you to create and deploy a web map without having Python installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this talk, you'll understand two straightforward methods to create and deploy web maps with Python, with practical examples you can begin using right away!&lt;/p&gt;
