While we can't possibly think and preempt everything from day 1(and if you try to - it'll take long to roll that feature out), we can do something better ðŸ¤”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we're going to be focusing on how you can avoid those mistakes early in your design phase ðŸ˜Œ - these are all the learnings I have had after making mistakes. We are going to cover the following -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auditing your models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boolean field for flags vs. timestamped field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft delete vs. hard delete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many boolean flags in a model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you decide when to de-normalize?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;em&gt;As with every piece of advice in life, the answer of whether you should apply these or not is - *&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; it depends.&amp;quot;** In this task, we'll also discuss when you can use this advice and when you can choose to skip it.*&lt;/blockquote&gt;
