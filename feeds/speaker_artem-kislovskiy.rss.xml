We will explore how it can help convey insights from data using Matplotlib and best practices for creating informative visualisations. We will also discuss the limitations of static visualisations and examine the role of continuous integration in streamlining the process and avoiding common pitfalls. By the end of this talk, you will have gained valuable insights and techniques for creating informative and accurate data visualisations, no matter what tools you're using.&lt;/p&gt;
