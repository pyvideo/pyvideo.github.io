Over the past 18 months Snyk has been converting their entire codebase to TypeScript, I would like to share the reasons, motivations and lessons learned with others thinking to do the same. There have been wins and bumps along the way but overall they left their codebase in a much better place than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look where we got to so far, what slowed us down in some places and what was our plan to complete the migration to 100% of the codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies are thinking of using TypeScript but may be scared to do so, I hope this talk can share some insight into what this journey is like.&lt;/p&gt;
