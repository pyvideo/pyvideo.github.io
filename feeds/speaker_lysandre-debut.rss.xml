With a focus on usability, simplicity, and customization, Diffusers is a modular toolbox for both simple inference and training of diffusion models. By seamlessly integrating with PyTorch, Diffusers streamlines the development process, making model implementation, training, and evaluation a breeze. Leveraging the power of PyTorch 2.0, Diffusers takes advantage of new features and improvements, empowering researchers and practitioners to push the boundaries of their projects. The library incorporates optimizations such as accelerated transformers and &lt;cite&gt;torch.compile()&lt;/cite&gt;, enhancing accessibility, inference speed, memory efficiency, and resource utilization. Through practical demonstrations, Diffusers showcases its potential in real-world scenarios, providing an indispensable tool for researchers and developers. Join us to explore how Diffusers democratizes diffusion models with PyTorch integration, optimizations, and practical demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;
