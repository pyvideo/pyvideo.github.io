It has lots of
&amp;quot;batteries&amp;quot; included, and makes it easy to get up and going. But all of
the power means you can write low quality code that still seems to work.
Effective Django development means building applications that are
testable, maintainable, and scalable. This talk-torial will cover the
skills needed to effective use Django.&lt;/p&gt;

million lines of Python, dating to before 2007. Python 3 shipped four
years ago, and we're excited about all of its improvements. But what's
it like to port 6 years and half a million lines to Python 3.3? Join me
to learn about why we want to port, what the initial porting experiment
revealed, and what the trouble areas are.&lt;/p&gt;

parts of the framework. But Django forms, fully leveraged, can help
developers be more productive and write more cohesive code. This talk
will dive deep into the stock Django forms package, as well as discuss a
strategy for abstracting validation for forms, and the use of unit and
integration tests with forms.&lt;/p&gt;

practice. Setting a break point and inspecting local variables is easy,
but what else can you do? What if you need to set the breakpoint in one
of your dependencies, or only fire it conditionally? How do you navigate
calls, or change them? Join me for an in depth look at how you can
better use PDB to debug and understand programs.&lt;/p&gt;
