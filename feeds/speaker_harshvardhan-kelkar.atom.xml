Topic: Computing Document similarity using nltk
Broadcast Time: Thursday, 3/22/2014 at 7:30pm
Location: LinkedIn, Mountain View&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract:
We will explore techniques to determine the amount of similarity between documents. Specifically we will look at the intuition behind tf-idf and cosine similarity. With that as a foundation we will see how to compute these metrics with the natural language tool kit.&lt;/p&gt;
