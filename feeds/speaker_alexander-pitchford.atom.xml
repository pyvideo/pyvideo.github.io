In
this talk you will learn about the ongoing projects that have invested
this project, from providing the framework to simulate quantum machine
learning for quantum computers to the development of efficient numerical
solvers tackling dynamical problems that are inherently hard to simulate
classically.

It can be noted that
`Astropy &lt;https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html&gt;`__ is a
community effort to develop a common core package for Astronomy in
Python and "foster an ecosystem of interoperable astronomy packages",

It seems an interesting model for the quantum tech landscape.
`Qiskit &lt;&gt;`__ did build its own ecosystem of sub-libraries for quantum
computing. The physics library for quantum tech is http://qutip.org .

About the idea of QuTiP as a super-library, here are some details:

-  | ``krotov``, a very recent package for optimal control built on top
     of QuTiP ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.11284).
   | [https://github.com/qucontrol/krotov].

-  ``piqs``, the permutational invariant quantum solver, now a QuTiP
   module (see also https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05129 );

-  ``matsubara``, a plugin to study the ultrastrong coupling regime with
   structured baths, http://matsubara.readthedocs.io/

-  ``QNET``, a computer algebra package for quantum mechanics and
   photonic quantum networks, which actually calls QuTiP as a plugin,
   mainly developed at Stanford in Mabuchi Lab
   https://github.com/mabuchilab/QNET

-  ``qptomographer``,
   https://qptomographer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install, a library to
   derive error bars for experiments in quantum computing and quantum
   information processing.

-  ``tiqs``, a library to study open quantum systems on extended
   lattices exploiting the symmetries of such systems,
   https://github.com/fminga/tiqs

-  other upcoming integrations relative to pulse control, such as
   ``qupulse``,
   https://github.com/qutech/qupulse/wiki/Architecture-Proposal

This talk will be of interest to the curious coder and researcher,
analyzing how QuTiP's impact in the research community has fostered a
`*lingua franca* for quantum tech
research &lt;https://twitter.com/goerz/status/1118739088595652611&gt;`__. We
will also draw comparisons with other larger ecosystems in Python-based
scientific projects, such as astropy and scikit-learn.

More about QuTiP
================

-  QuTiP is the open-source software to study quantum physics. It
   develops both an intuitive playground to understand quantum mechanics
   and cutting-edge tools to investigate it.
-  QuTiP provides the most comprehensive toolbox to characterize noise
   and dissipation –realistic processes– affecting quantum systems, as
   well as tools not only to monitor but also to minimize their impact
   (quantum optimal control, description of decoherence-free spaces).
-  For this reason QuTiP is a software born out of the quantum optics
   community and that has become increasingly relevant for the quantum
   computing community, as current quantum computing devices are noisy
   (NISQ definition by Preskill).
-  ``pypinfo`` data shows that QuTiP is popular in countries that are
   strong in quantum tech and quantum computing research, eg, The
   Netherlands in the top five, as well as countries that benefit in the
   use of open source software (OSS) for university coursework, eg,
   India.
-  In the past three years, there has been an evolution in the quantum
   tech community, which has embraced OSS.
-  OSS libraries are used as a means to grow the user base, as well as
   in a more structural way for quantum computers, as they provide cloud
   access to quantum devices, e.g., IBM Q.
-  QuTiP is the only major library that has continued to thrive in this
   ecosystem, competing with other library packages that are funded by
   corporations or VC-backed startups/
-  Since the tools of QuTiP provide a common ground to study quantum
   mechanics, it is important that this independent project is provided
   with the necessary support to thrive
-  As access to quantum computers becomes more and more widespread also
   for the use of data scientist and QuTiP's popularity grows even more
   for undergraduate and graduate courses, becoming the de-facto
   standard OSS to study quantum optical systems, it is imperative that
   the QuTiP library makes a quality jump to provide a comprehensive
   introduction to its tools for a much broader community of users.

(http://qutip.org), has emerged from a library to an *ecosystem*. QuTiP
is used for education, to teach quantum physics. In research and
industry, for quantum computing simulation.
