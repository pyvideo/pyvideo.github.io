to a WSGI-compliant one. We chose uWSGI as our host because of its
performance and feature set. But, while powerful, uWSGI's defaults are
driven by backward compatibility and are not ideal for new deployments.
Powerful features can be overlooked due to the sheer magnitude of its
feature set and spotty documentation. As we've scaled up the number of
services hosted by uWSGI over the last year, we've had to tweak our
standard configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll present the base uWSGI configuration we use as a
starting point for all services, as well as some tips to avoid known
gotchas and provide a base level of defensiveness and high reliability.
This base configuration makes use of several &amp;quot;no-cost&amp;quot; uWSGI features
that help protect services from common, yet difficult to prevent issues
-- some of which we discovered the hard way. We'll also talk about some
programmatic uWSGI features which can be leveraged to improve
reliability and improve outage response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Some of the topics we'll cover include:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Mitigating memory leaks&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Mitigating stuck, hung, or infinitely looping processes&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Preventing misconfigurations&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Preventing wasted development effort&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;- Improving outage response&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://codewith.mu/"&gt;https://codewith.mu/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Sunday afternoon I foolishly asked myself, &amp;quot;How hard can it be to
write a simple code editor?&amp;quot; Several years later an international team
of volunteers are still working on the project. We have had to address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross platform GUI development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross platform packaging solutions for Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating an interactive visual debugger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating with iPython notebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating with various IoT MicroPython devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating with frameworks such as PyGame/PyGameZero and Flask.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating cross platform testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researching and testing UX with a challenging user base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessibility for all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internationalisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating an inclusive, welcoming and supportive community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explain why Mu was created, how Mu was created and, most
importantly, shares the decision making, technical research and
implementation details of Mu in the hope others can learn from our
mistakes, mis-steps and muck-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

as well may spend much more time debugging code dealing with the time
zones, daylight saving time shifts and datetime stuff in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll look at a few pitfalls you may encounter when working with
datetimes in Python. We'll dissect the pytz library, explain why it
contains over 500 individual time zones while focusing on the 63 entries
in Europe. We'll also find the reason why pytz is not part of the
standard Python, why it gets updated so often and why even that won't
solve all your problems. Do you know what happens after 2021 when the EU
stops DST switching?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two centuries of short-sighted propaganda and long-term chaos in
forty-five minutes. Maybe that will make you want to avoid time zones in
your code altogether!&lt;/p&gt;

development in languages like c++?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observing my teams’ experimentations, the python community, and reading,
I have adopted various habits, patterns, and tools. But most importantly
I learned thinking in Python. I consider thinking in Python a key for
rapid development and good engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking in a programming language affects the amount of information you
need to keep in your working memory. It also affects the abstractions
and tools that pop in your mind and then used in constructing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore what it means to think in Python. Why Python allows you to
focus on problem solving, while languages like c++ often distract your
attention from the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will cover some good and bad practices by examples while
trying to consider the amount of effort needed to write it, read it, and
talk about it with other team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Takeaways: Tips for speeding your work without compromising quality,
and reasoning for using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The audience should be comfortably familiar with the process of
software development, and software problem solving, and experience
using Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

code to process large amounts of requests coming to our back-ends. With
the separation of our codebase to microservices, we can quickly try new
tools and different approaches to process these large volumes of
requests. The microservice we’ll be talking about is making unreliable
slow 3rd party services reliable and asynchronous with a bit of business
logic sprinkled on top of it. We’ll tell a failure story of ours but
resulting in a valuable lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of our services use Celery and it’s the go-to tool for new services
as well but we wanted to be different with this new microservice. RQ is
the next best choice for task queues and it is presented as simpler and
more straightforward than Celery. That can definitely be true but after
3 weeks of research, development and struggling we found out the
unpleasant truth about being simple and making the right choices. We
won’t talk about comparing the frameworks but rather about the approach
on how to experiment with new things in your environment. After that,
we’ll present our current setup which can take upon any number of
tasks*. How we orchestrate the app and continuously integrate and
deploy and what fun things await ahead of us in the development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Conditions may apply.&lt;/p&gt;
