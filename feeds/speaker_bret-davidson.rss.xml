through basic training in core elements of the modern research skill
set like Python and scientific computing. Weâ€™ll show how we are
simplifying the learning experience for novice data scientists using
Vagrant and Ansible to provision reproducible computing environments
for use in our Summer of Open Science workshop series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern research practice asks researchers to engage with information
in new ways through the use of digital technologies. The landscape of
this skillset is rapidly changing and difficult to pinpoint at an
interdisciplinary level. The modern researcher is expected to navigate
digital tools that are not unique to the work that they do on a daily
basis within their discipline and to be able to share that work in
meaningful ways with collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open science has become increasingly relevant to modern scientific
practice and reflects the development of the modern research skill
set. There is a rising tide of policy that requires researchers to
navigate open methodology in order to gain access to grant funding.
Despite a shift towards support of open science in major policy making
bodies, such as the OECD, the training that early career researchers
receive has not caught up with this fast changing policy landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
