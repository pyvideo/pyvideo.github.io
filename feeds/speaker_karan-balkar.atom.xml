Chaos engineering is the process through which one can conduct a series of experiments in order to build confidence in a system’s capability to withstand unexpected behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objective
The objective of this talk is to help developers working on Python-based web apps to learn about how they can use a simple toolkit to carry out such chaos experiments. The Chaos toolkit (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chaostoolkit.org/"&gt;https://chaostoolkit.org/&lt;/a&gt;) would help Python developers to customize their experiments as per their project requirements. This can be further automated leveraging CI/CD and Cloud technologies to be able to maintain resiliency in production apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem statement
More often than not developers face a lot of issues when scaling their applications or when certain unpredictable situations occur. Using the Chaos toolkit developers can determine the resiliency of their application under a chaos situation. In addition, developers can create custom experiments that could be automated to identify failures before they become outages. The session will demonstrate how to achieve a better resiliency using the Chaos toolkit for existing web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaways
Key takeaways from this sessions:
* Understanding important concepts of Chaos engineering
* Learn what is meant by steady state hypothesis and create experiments for your Python based web app
* Automating the process through CI/CD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demo solution highlights
Following are the highlights:
* Demonstrating how to setup your first experiment using Chaos toolkit
* Defining steady-state-hypothesis, probes and controls
* Running the experiment under various chaos conditions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
