These results indicate that on a team of 20 engineers, up to 3 people on the team may have what are called &amp;quot;neurodivergent&amp;quot; brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the symptoms of ADHD and ASD? What are the so-called neurodivergent &amp;quot;superpowers&amp;quot; you may have seen on social media? How can we create work environments that foster ease and success for neurodivergent software engineers? Join this session to find out!&lt;/p&gt;

We’re taught that it “tells Python the function is done” and often not much else about it! What happens if you forget to include a return at the end of a function? What if you try to use one outside of a function? Can a function return another function? Come learn about all of the cool things you can achieve in your programs through a better understanding of return statements!&lt;/p&gt;
