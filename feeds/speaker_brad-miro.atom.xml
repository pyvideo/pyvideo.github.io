learning continues to grows with it. We'll discuss techniques and methods
for distributing machine learning training such as data parallelism and
model parallelism. We'll then discuss how to build scalable machine learning
systems and show two examples of this using Python: one with Apache Spark
MLlib, one with TensorFlow.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ll give an overview of what’s available in the new version as well as
do a deep dive into an example using its central high-level API, Keras.
You’ll walk away with a better understanding of how you can get started
building machine learning models in Python with TensorFlow 2.0 as well
as the other exciting available features!&lt;/p&gt;
