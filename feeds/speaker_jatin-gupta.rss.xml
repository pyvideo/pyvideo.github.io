Design Thinking is a sought-after practice in the design world but is hardly talked about in the field of AI. As AI continues to impact millions of people around the world, having a conversation about how design thinking can be used to better design AI systems becomes that much more important.
Broadly, this talk will cover the following topics:
1. Principles of Design Thinking and its significance in AI
2. AI Ethics
3. A set of guiding principles and frameworks that teams can use to design their AI systems
4. Case studies and stories where design thinking can be/has been applied&lt;/p&gt;
