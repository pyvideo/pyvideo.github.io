Priidu Kull - Weaving a Search Engine around User's Workflow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will discuss my attempt to build a search engine for legal documents that lawyers would love to use. I tried to figure out how lawyers work with documents and to build a search engine that would best fit their workflows. I will discuss the methods that I have used for finding out about their workflows and the decisions that I had to make to best accommodate the workflows of my users. The talk will include practical advice on using Elasticsearch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the author:  I was a lawyer, then decided to become a coder because I enjoyed coding so much and I was motivated by the ability to make a difference that coders possess more than lawyers. Currently I have three years of experience in software development, including 1.5 years working for a software development firm. The project that will feature in my talk is online at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://legal.ee/"&gt;http://legal.ee/&lt;/a&gt; and I am currently putting in full time effort to develop it.&lt;/p&gt;
