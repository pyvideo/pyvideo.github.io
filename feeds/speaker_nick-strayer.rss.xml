Some key enhancements include the integration of new bslib components and the editor's ability to create or navigate to existing server bindings for inputs and outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to new features, the editor is now available as a VSCode extension enabling it to integrate smoothly into more developers' workflows. This talk will showcase how these new capabilities empower users to efficiently create visually appealing and production-ready applications with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
