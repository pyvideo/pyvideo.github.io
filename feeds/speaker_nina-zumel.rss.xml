The vtreat package automates common data preparation steps for
supervised machine learning. In this talk, we will introduce vtreat and
demonstrate its effective use with Pandas and xgboost on real-world
data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data characterization, treatment, and cleaning are necessary (though not
always glamorous) components of machine learning and data science
projects. While there is no substitute for getting your hands dirty in
the data, there are many data issues that repeat from project to
project. In particular, there are pitfalls in properly dealing with
missing data values, previously unobserved categorical values, and
high-cardinality categorical variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will discuss using the vtreat package to prepare data
for supervised machine learning. We will demonstrate vtreat on a
real-world data set, with xgboost and Pandas. Vtreat automates the
statistically sound treatment of common data problems, leaving the data
scientist free to concentrate on problem-specific data and modeling
issues.&lt;/p&gt;
