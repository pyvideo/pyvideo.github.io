Traditionally, systems engineering approaches have relied on clunky, proprietary, opaque tools to model, analyze, and design system structure and behavior. Python's core features--openness, simplicity, and object-oriented paradigm make it a very attractive replacement, if used correctly. With this in mind, this presentation will give the case for using Python as an environment for model-based systems engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
