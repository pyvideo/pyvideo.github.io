that lets GitHub use GitHub to build GitHub. From a couple of guys in a
coffee shop to almost 100 employees, millions of users, and massive open
source projects that are powering businesses around the world, it's been
a bit of a wild ride. Hear about some lessons learned and challenges
we've faced: things we've done right and others that didn't work out so
well. Learn a little bit about our growing technology stack and how we
design and deploy features. Get some insight into why we still have no
managers and how everyone decides what to work on. Finally, hear about
how open source has shaped the company and our vision of 'open' in
everything from hardware to politics to education and science. The
social web is old news, but the collaborative web is just in its infancy
and GitHub sees that as a very bright future.&lt;/p&gt;
