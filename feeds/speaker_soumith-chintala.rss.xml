scientific computing, mainly
aimed at deep learning workloads. The framework consists of an ndarray
library that natively
supports GPU execution, an automatic differentiation engine that is
flexible and fast, and
an optimization package for gradient based optimization methods. We
shall discuss practical
workflows, our features on top of python multiprocessing for efficient
parallel data loaders
and finally we shall briefly look at our upcoming just-in-time Tensor
compiler to fuse
computations and execute them more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soumith Chintala is a Researcher at Facebook AI Research, where he
works on deep learning,
reinforcement learning, generative image models, agents for video
games and large-scale
high-performance deep learning. Prior to joining Facebook in August
2014, he worked at
MuseAmi, where he built deep learning models for music and vision
targeted at mobile
devices. He holds a Masters in CS from NYU, and spent time in Yann
LeCun's NYU lab building
deep learning models for pedestrian detection, natural image OCR,
depth-images among others.&lt;/p&gt;
