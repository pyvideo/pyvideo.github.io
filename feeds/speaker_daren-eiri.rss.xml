&lt;p&gt;When an error happens in your API, Shiny App, or quarto document, it is not always clear what line of code you need to look at, and the error messages aren’t always helpful. By walking through a simple API example, I show how you can use logging packages like log4r to provide error messages that make sense to you. I also show how you can use cloud-based data collection platforms like Azure Monitor or AWS CloudWatch to set up alerts, so you can get notified by email or text message for those severe errors that you need to be immediately aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gain more visibility into the health of your code by incorporating logging and pushing your logs to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
