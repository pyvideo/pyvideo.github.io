VAE offers a novel way to enforce structure on the representation surface, by doing so, it opens the possibility of employing traditional semi supervised learning techniques on the structured embedding space. In this talk I will cover how VAE impose latent space structure constraint, and how we can use it in a semi-supervised settings.&lt;/p&gt;
