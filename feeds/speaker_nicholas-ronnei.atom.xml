Our work focuses on mitigating that problem as it relates to SRTM and ASTER GDEM. This is a discussion about how Python works within a broader system that enables researchers to work around this uncertainty without being geostatistics experts. The talk will cover how we use Python for advanced raster processing (including a vertical datum correction), calculating error statistics, and interacting with our spatial database as well as what we're doing with the end product, including a live demo.&lt;/p&gt;
