&lt;p&gt;Not everyone can or wants to solely write code for the rest of their working careers, so we'll explore other ways of advancing in your career, including ways that don't involve traditional management roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broader-scale individual contributor roles, such as principal engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running your own consultancy agency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management roles, both technical and non-technical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our panelists include (and more will be added before the session):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charles Rejonis, Chief Products Officer, Wharton Research Data Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elizabeth Christensen, manager at Crunchydata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frank Wiles, founder of REVSYS and former Django Software Foundation President&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew Godwin, longtime Django core contributor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julia Solórzano, [2023 Keynote Speaker](/news/julia-solorzano/)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to be an experienced developer to get something out of this talk; this talk will be helpful to people starting out on their career track so they can know what might lie ahead as well as managers who want to better understand the developer career mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

You don’t have to be a Postgres expert to get started with a few key performance improvements. This gentle introduction is meant for folks who’ve never ventured into their database before, or those who have been turning knobs blindly. I’ll present how Postgres uses memory. Then, I’ll connect that to how you can monitor, tune, and optimize queries. You’ll be ready to take on the challenge as your application grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#### Review of how Postgres uses memory
Measuring cache hit ratio
Measuring memory usage and tuning
Measuring shared buffer usage and tuning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#### Connection settings
Default connection settings, knowing when you need more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#### Stop runwaywas
Setting a statement timeout
Finding and stopping transactions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#### Query performance
Using EXPLAIN
Reading and understanding EXPLAIN plans
Logging EXPLAIN plans
Adding Indexes&lt;/p&gt;
