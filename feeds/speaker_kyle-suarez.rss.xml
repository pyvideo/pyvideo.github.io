It
is the fundamental package for scientific and statistical computing in
Python. MongoDB’s scale, speed, and flexibility make it ideal for
storing large amounts of data. However, the official MongoDB driver is
not optimized for loading MongoDB documents into NumPy arrays. Enter
“Monary”, which allows you to easily examine and manipulate data using
NumPy arrays. We will explore how Monary can accelerate your scientific
analysis while providing you with the scale and flexibility of MongoDB
and the ease of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
