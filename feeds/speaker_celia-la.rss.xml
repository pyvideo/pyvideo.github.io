hashtags, followers, retweets, and replies. Using the network analysis
tool NetworkX, we'll look at how to make sense of these channels. We'll
cover the basics of network theory, including types of networks and how
measure influence, and we'll apply those measures to our investigation
of Twitter's network.&lt;/p&gt;
