&lt;p&gt;Water Mission is a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing safe
water solutions where needed around the world. The IBM jStart team is
helping Water Mission to analyze water consumption data from Water
Mission's treatment stations in Uganda and Tanzania. Jupiter notebooks
are used to combine and correlate data with socio-economic and weather
data, look for behavioral patterns, predict water shortages, and
suggest changes to the way the stations are operated in order to
increase delivery of safe drinking water within the local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
