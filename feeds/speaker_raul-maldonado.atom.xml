&lt;p&gt;Description
Python development has had a great emergence in development of statistical packages, algorithms, and implementations. However, with the development and ease of practicing statistics &amp;amp; algorithms, there are still some rules and constraints one must follow to obtain quality solutions. And that is especially true with AB Testing, a statistical procedure to provide data-driven insights in uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the speaker
Data Analyst residing in San Francisco, CA. Specialize in SQL Python, BI, and other related responsibilities. Additionally, Raul spends his time creating technical side-projects and volunteering in the intersection of Data and Technology/Coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a breakout Session on frequentist AB Testing in python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll explore the jungle of application and statistical methodology and
practice with examples of Click Through Rates, the early metrics of
choice for AB Testing in production. That being said, compared to your
last statistics course you may have taken in the past, there are still
some rules and constraints one must follow to obtain quality solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
