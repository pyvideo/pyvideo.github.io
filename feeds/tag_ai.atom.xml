&lt;p&gt;Many people think of neural networks as magic boxes, using them as such
is similar to allowing the computer or the machine to have a mind of
their own. Classification and prediction are the best-known applications
of these algorithms. But it has been demonstrated that they can also be
used in multiple creative or artistic ways such as generating pictures,
musical pieces, humour based dialogues or jokes and plays or literary
pieces. Leading to the following question: can these black boxes express
true creativity? A trait commonly associated with humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic Art (or computer generated art) refers to the use of
computer algorithms to create artistic pieces. Algorithmic art has been
around from the early 1960s, when artists used a plotter controlled by a
computer to create some visual artwork pieces. In the 80s when computer
graphics became more accessible, digital fractal artworks dominated to
become the mainstream of algorithmic art. By the end of the 80s, genetic
algorithms had matured enough to have a major influence in the
algorithmic composition of music. At the same time, the artificial
neural networks were used to explore the creation of musical
compositions. Most recently, thanks to the blooming of neural network
frameworks (e.g. tensorflow), availability of GPUs and development in
sophisticated neural network architecture, they play an important part
in academic research and data science business applications. Besides
that, these enhanced resources and frameworks have enabled the neural
networks to make significant contributions in the area of Algorithmic
Arts. Examples of this are the Deep Dream and artistic style transfer
and GANs (generative adversarial network) which can generate highly
deceptive pictures. A specially trained neural network is also capable
of composing music mimicking the style of Beethoven or generating a
modern music piece. In the same way, a neural network can be used to
generate poems or literary pieces in the true style of Shakespeare or
Hamilton. In this talk, we will go through a gallery of art and music
created by algorithms, showcasing what roles computers took in different
algorithmic art forms. From the earliest fractal art to the music and
pictures generated by the state of the art neural networks and GANs.
This talk is suitable for everyone, from the curious general public to
experts in the field of neural networks, both will find this talk
inspiring and amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state-of-the-art in image classification has skyrocketed thanks to the development of deep convolutional neural networks and increases in the amount of data and computing power available to train them. The top-5 error rate in the ImageNet competition to predict which of 1000 classes an image belongs to has plummeted from 28% error in 2010 to just 2.25% in 2017 (human level error is around 5%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being able to classify objects in images (including not hotdogs), deep learning can be used to automatically generate captions for images, convert photos into paintings, detect cancer in pathology slide images, and help self-driving cars ‘see’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revolution-in-waiting for user experience is conversational AI, and this revolution should be available to everyone. The ability to communicate with your computer via a fulfilling and useful conversation will change the way we approach user interaction. Recent advances in machine learning have made this goal not only possible to reach, but possible to bring to the developer community at large. At Rasa we have developed a set of open-source Python libraries which can comprehend natural language and handle complex, interesting conversations. We utilise deep learning to bypass existing rigid conversational norms (state machines, if/else statements, etc.) and allow developers to make awesome bots simply by talking to them.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk introduces the deep learning library PyTorch by explaining the exciting math, cool ideas and simple code behind what makes really deep neural networks work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern neural networks consist of hundreds of computation layers! These very deep architectures consistently outperform shallower networks in a variety of tasks. However just simply stacking layers on top of each other won't work because the gradients are either vanishing or exploding during optimisation procedure. This talk explains the exciting math, cool ideas and elegant code that modern neural network architectures such as ResNets, HighwayNets and DenseNets are applying to circumvent the problem using PyTorch. PyTorch is a relatively new deep learning framework that is deeply integrated into Python. Unlike other frameworks such as TensorFlow and Theano, it uses tape-based automatic differentiation to run computation immediately, supports dynamic neural networks and provides a powerful GPU-accelerated Tensor library. The talk concludes with some real-world use-cases for very deep neural networks in chemical-genetic profiling and autonomous driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Scientist working on predictive analytics with data from pipeline inspection measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will show how we use real and synthetic data to create successful models for risk assessing pipeline anomalies. The main focus is the estimation of the difference in the statistical properties of real and generated data by machine learning methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROSEN provides predictive analytics for pipelines by detecting and risk assessing anomalies from data gathered by inline inspection measurement devices. Due to budget reasons (pipelines need to be dug up to get acess) ground truth data for machine learning applications in this field are usually scarce, imbalanced and not available for all existing configurations of measurement devices. This creates the need for synthetic data (using FEM simulations and unsupervised learning algorithms) in order to be able to create successful models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a naive mixture of real-world and synthetic samples in a model does not necessarily yield to an increased predictive performance because of differences in the statistical distributions in feature space. I will show how we evaluate the use of synthetic data besides simple visual inspection. Manifold learning (e.g. TSNE) can be used to gain an insight whether real and generated data are inherently different.
Quantitative approaches like classifiers trained to discriminate between these types of data provide a non visual insight whether a &amp;quot;synthetic gap&amp;quot; in the feature distributions exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the synthetic data is useful for model building careful considerations have to be applied when constructing cross validation folds and test sets to prevent biased estimates of the model performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am Samuel (Samu for friends). With a curious mind I studied computer science, then focused in machine learning and IoT as a professional career. I haven't given up on my plan to take over the world; that's why my coworkers know a crazy idea is coming out, when I can't hide any longer a mischievous smile. I like to meet people and understand other points of view, and in return I like to show what I can do and teach what I have mastered. But, what drives me crazy is rollerskating with disco music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to predict the point in the screen where a person is looking at? Easy to say but hard to do. An eye tracking system is the perfect project to learn the difficulties of applied machine learning. From gathering training data to building the final software with an acceptable performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will show how to build an eye tracking system from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the approach (machine learning) and the tools (Python ecosystem) are set, the important tasks are:     Making users addicted to a game built with Pygame in order to generate data.     Unleashing the power of deep learning over GPU with Tensorflow to train an Artificial Neural Network.     Exploiting the training model in real time so as to control a computer with the eyes with PyAutoGUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path is full of pitfalls and every clear single step to the goal turns out to be a mountain of small but very important subtasks. Every iteration is a continuous struggle just to gain a bit of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these efforts, at the very end we will see the difference between the theoretical and the real world. Our engineering skills will determine the usability of the new interface that allows us to move the mouse with our eyes; and we will learn that things don't need to be perfect, because humans are ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an independent data scientist with a background in computer science, in-depth in algorithms, data analysis, high-performance computing and software engineering. My current interests include machine learning and data visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pythonistas have access to an extensive collection of tools for data analysis. The space of tools is best understood as an ecosystem: Libraries build upon each other, and a good library fills an ecological niche by doing certain jobs well. This is a guided tour of the Python data science ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Python Ecosystem for Data Science: A Guided Tour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is on its way to becoming the lingua franca of data science, and Pythonistas have access to an impressive and extensive collection of tools for data analysis. Here, a data scientist needs to see the forest for the trees: The space of tools is best understood as an ecosystem, where libraries build upon each other, and where a good library fills an ecological niche by doing certain jobs well. This talk is a guided tour of the Python data science ecosystem. More than a list of libraries, it aims to provide some structure, classing tools by type of data, size of data, and type of analysis. In our tour, we visit a number of areas, including working with tabular data (numpy, pandas, dask, ...) and graph data (e.g. networkx), statistics (e.g. statsmodels), machine learning (scikit-learn, ...), data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, ...). Aspiring data scientists, and everyone else working with data, should find this useful for selecting the right tools for their next data-driven project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I am doing my PhD in Particle Physics - which mainly involves development of software in a large collaboration. I love working with Python and C++ to process large amounts of data. Of course it needs to be processed as quickly as possible. I am working on the core reconstruction algorithms for our experiment, which are steered and controlled using Python. Apart from that, I was working as a Data Science Engineer for Blue Yonder, a leading machine learning company, where the idea for tsfresh was born. I am still heavily involved in the project. When I am not writing code, I am updating myself on the newest technical geek stuff (mostly cloud computing and deep learning) or play the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought about developing a time series model to predict stock prices? Or do you consider log time series from the operation of cloud resources as being more compelling? In this case you really should consider using the time series feature extraction package tsfresh for your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, and precision medicine are driven by the availability of cheap sensors and advancing connectivity, which among others increases the availability of temporally annotated data. The resulting time series are the basis for manifold machine learning applications. Examples are the classification of hard drives into risk classes concerning specific defect, the log analysis of server farms for detecting intruders, or regression tasks like the prediction of the remaining lifespan of machinery. Tsfresh also allows to easily setup a machine learning pipeline that predicts stock prices, which we will demonstrate live during the presentation ;). The problem of extracting and selecting relevant features for classification or regression is these domains is especially hard to solve, if each label or regression target is associated with several time series and meta-information simultaneously – which is a common pattern in industrial applications. This talk introduces a distributed and parallel feature extraction and selection algorithm – the recently published Python library tsfresh. The fully automated extraction and importance selection does not only allow to reach better machine learning classification scores, but in combination with the speed of the package, also allows to incorporate tsfresh into automated AI-pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

questions. Unfortunately, generating such questions can be very
time-consuming and it is typically done manually. In this talk we
will present a pipeline to automatically generate quiz games starting
from generic knowledge (e.g. Wikipedia). The pipeline consists of the
following components: (i) a parser to retrieve text from Wikipedia
pages, (ii) a Natural Language Processing module (based on the Google
Natural Language API) to extract information about syntax, entities
and relations, (iii) a Natural Language Generation module to generate
test questions and correct answers, and finally (iv) a domain-aware
module that uses domain-specific knowledge to generate wrong answers
(i.e. distractors). Every module is written in Python and it is based
on either available libraries or Cloud services (e.g., Google Natural
Language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: basic knowledge of python, minimal understanding
of text syntactic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
