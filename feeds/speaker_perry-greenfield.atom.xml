absence of shared efforts in the field. While there are well known, free
software tools available for astronomy, most have been developed by
large institutions, and the past few decades have seen comparatively
little progress in fostering a community-based set of software tools.
There is hope that is changing now. The continuing growth of Python in
astronomy has led to an increasing awareness of needless duplication of
efforts within the community and the need to make existing packages work
better with each other; such discussions came to a head on the astropy
email list in the spring of 2011 leading to formation of the astropy
project. The first coordination meeting was held in the fall of 2011,
and significant progress has been made in setting up a community
repository of core astronomical packages. We will describe the general
goals of astropy and the progress that has been made to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astropy continues to see significant growth in available software,
developers, and users. A new major release (V0.3) was made in the past
year as well as many minor releases. V0.4 is scheduled for release by
the time of conference and will include support for the VO SAMP
protocol. We will report on the progress made in building and enhancing
the core libraries in the Astropy Project, including a new model and
fitting framework, enhanced units, quantities, and table functionality,
a VO cone search tool, and a new convolution subpackage. We'll review
the current set of tools available, highlighting in particular the new
capabilities present. We will also give an overview of current
activities and development plans for the core and affiliated packages,
as well as adding new resources/tutorials for learning how to use
astropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Units/quantities (15 minutes) [Droettboom]&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise: Solve problems using standard units; define new unit;
use unit equivalencies; define blackbody function using

It was developed to overcome many of the limitations of the most common astronomical format called FITS. Nevertheless, it has been designed to be a generic format for scientific and engineering data, overcoming many of the limitations of the common scientific formats available currently. It features support for transparent metadata, a flexible and extensible structure of the metadata and data. The data may be represented either in readable or binary form. There is a schema system for ensuring that data files comply with the expected content, both in structure, and permitted values for attributes in the structure. Components of the structure can contain information used by libraries to turn those components into software objects (e.g., instances of Python classes). Extensions can be defined by local usages taking full advantage of the machinery to validate files against the schemas for such extensions. The format can support the serialization of complex mathematical functions, particularly those made out of expressions of simpler functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will outline advantages of the format against existing alternatives and briefly outline the details of the format internals, with some illustrative examples of use within the Python library we have developed to use it (the format itself has been designed to be language neutral). This will be followed first by Jupyter notebook-based exercises with existing files to learn how to view the structure, search for content, access data, and modify the content. Next will be lessons and exercises on creating ASDF files from scratch, and how to create new extensions to the format. We will finish by outlining near future improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tutorial is for anyone with needs to store science or engineering data, particularly if they find the existing solutions inadequate. Only knowledge of Python and numpy is required.&lt;/p&gt;
