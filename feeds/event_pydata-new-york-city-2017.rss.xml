In this talk, we will walk through the process of implementing a real model, starting from the beginning with data collection and cleaning. We will cover topics like feature selection, window normalization, and feature scaling. We will also present development tips for testing and deploying models.&lt;/p&gt;

These new methodologies go hand in hand with an exponential growth in data volumes and rates - petabyte scale data collections and terabyte/sec. At the same time scientists are pushing for a paradigm shift. As they can now observe processes in intricate details, they want to analyze, interpret and control those processes. Given the multitude of voluminous, heterogenous data streams involved in every single experiment, novel real time, data driven analysis and decision support approaches are needed to realize their vision. This talk will discuss state of the art streaming analysis for experimental facilities, its challenges and early successes. It will present where commercial technologies can be leveraged and how many of the novel approaches differ from commonly available solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk is a case study in using open source Python packages to analyze these reports in order to understand the relationship between game dynamics, player abilities, and foul calls. Our main goal is to quantify the relationship between player ability and foul calls. Since intentional fouls are a ubiquitous part of the NBA endgame, this data set also contains rich information about the relationship between game dynamics and intentional fouls for us to model. This case study showcases the role of open source Python pacakges in a modern statistical modeling workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

Our search engine allows the user to take a photo of a room and retrieve with a high recall a list of items identical or visually similar to those present in the photo. Additionally, it allows to return other items that aesthetically and stylistically fit well together. To achieve this goal, our system blends the results obtained using textual and visual modalities. Thanks to this blending strategy, we increase the average style similarity score of the retrieved items by 11%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work is implemented as a Web-based application and it is planned to be opened to the public on Tooploox website.&lt;/p&gt;

Model-agnostic interpretability promises to regain interpretability without sacrificing accuracy. I introduce LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), conceptually and applied to a classification problem: whether couples are likely to stay together, or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's talk theory and practice about workflow modeling &amp;amp; processing!&lt;/p&gt;

We share our insights in orchestration of the supply chain of financial datasets to wrangle and ultimately evaluate the data itself.&lt;/p&gt;
