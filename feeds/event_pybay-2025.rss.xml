Can AI companies freely use your open-source code as training data? What are the legal ramifications when an AI system infringes upon existing intellectual property rights?Alla will address these critical questions focused on code and IP law. The talk aims to demystify the complex legal landscape developers may find themselves navigating when using AI-generated code.&lt;/p&gt;

Traditionally, systems engineering approaches have relied on clunky, proprietary, opaque tools to model, analyze, and design system structure and behavior. Python's core features--openness, simplicity, and object-oriented paradigm make it a very attractive replacement, if used correctly. With this in mind, this presentation will give the case for using Python as an environment for model-based systems engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

SHAP helps explain predictions by attributing importance to input features using concepts from game theory. In this talk, we’ll cover the need for explainability, introduce the intuition behind Shapley values, and walk through a couple of case studies using boosted tree-based and neural network based models. We’ll also discuss SHAP plots, best practices, challenges, and pitfalls when working with large datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

Context managers have been part of Python since 2005, but they're still as useful as ever. In this entertaining talk, we'll explore why context managers exist, how they work, when to reach for them, and how they synergize with the contextvars module. Whether you're a beginner or a veteran Pythonista, you're sure to learn something new. And, thanks to context managers, you can rest assured that this talk won't leak any open file handles.&lt;/p&gt;

However, inevitably, the &lt;cite&gt;&amp;#64;dataclass&lt;/cite&gt; decorator will fall short of your needs as a program grows over time and gains complexity. This talk will walk through how to build the most important features of &lt;cite&gt;dataclasses&lt;/cite&gt; yourself so you'll know what to do. It will also investigate the advanced techniques &lt;cite&gt;dataclasses&lt;/cite&gt; uses under the hood to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

Wherever you fall on the spectrum, as a developer, you likely won’t be able to avoid AI.And yes, you still have to write your unit tests – more so now than ever.This talk hopes to help you strike the right balance between leveraging and leaning on AI by stepping through different strategies for approaching unit testing.&lt;/p&gt;

They need to connect and communicate with other application across a network. Event-Driven Architecture is a common pattern for facilitating this connectivity, using Events as the communication abstraction. However, this pattern introduces complexities as well, such as fragmented logic, increased latency, decreased observability, and more. But what if there were a way to get the benefits of Event-Driven Architecture without the complexities?&lt;/p&gt;

Many of features that allow you to do inadvisable things were used to achieve things that since became defining features of Python.Python – unlike many languages – discovered that leaving these features lying next to dangerous things was a bad idea, and built guardrails around them.In this talk, we’ll explore this design philosophy, and use that to explain Python’s attitude to safely working with the language and its internals.&lt;/p&gt;

Code reviews are critical but tedious to do manually. This is why we built a context-engineering approach at CodeRabbit that mimics how senior engineers review Python code. We feed context to LLMs from multiple sources including issue tickets, dependency graphs, MCP servers (Notion, Confluence), Linters/SAST, and your AI coding agent guidelines. This approach helps LLMs catch hidden bugs and edge cases that would otherwise slip through.&lt;/p&gt;

With the scarcity of openings for interns and new grads relative to previous years, internships are now more important than ever.

The challenge isn't building better tools – it's making them accessible.For developers who want advanced testing to be not just possible, but practical.&lt;/p&gt;

But sometimes, using async can actually make programs slower.This talk explores common asyncio mistakes, how misunderstanding I/O-bound vs. CPU-bound tasks hurts performance, and practical patterns for writing efficient async code.Through real-world examples and live demos, you’ll leave with a clear model for using asyncio effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
