engineering information in there too! See what we are mining out of
airborne laser scanning data to enhance the resilience of coastal
communities. Dr. Stephen Medeiros, a lecturer in Civil Engineering at
the University of Central Florida, describes his team’s work in
Geospatial Data Fusion for coastal resilience. Dr. Medeiros uses
airborne laser scanning data (aka lidar) to characterize surface
roughness for use in computer models for hurricane storm surge. All of
his students are required to learn and apply Python to their data
science tasks such as ETL, machine learning, and statistical analysis of
a variety of environmental data such as wind speeds, water levels, and
3D laser scanning point clouds. By describing the coastal floodplain in
intricate detail, Dr. Medeiros and his students study how the roughness
of the landscape influence hurricane winds and storm surge behavior.
This work is carried out on the STOKES HPC at the Advanced Research
Computing Center in UCF’s Institute for Simulation and Training.&lt;/p&gt;
