In this talk, we'll explore how to harness the power of Selenium with Python alongside the Robot Framework to create robust and efficient automated tests. As QA engineers, we face numerous challenges in delivering quality software under tight deadlines, and integrating these tools can streamline our testing processes. I'll start by understanding the fundamentals of Selenium and Robot Framework, then walk through setting up our environment and writing our first test suite together. We'll share best practices for maintaining our test scripts and discuss real-world applications demonstrating how these tools can enhance collaboration and improve software quality. By the end of the session, we’ll be equipped with the knowledge and resources to elevate our automation strategies and foster a quality culture in our development teams.&lt;/p&gt;
