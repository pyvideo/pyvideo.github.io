hardware and software for decades, depriving the world of the most
efficient text entry system devised to date. Plover, a free,
cross-platform steno engine that works with $45 hardware, offers hackers
and hobbyists the ability to type at up to 240 WPM in applications
ranging from wearable computing to captioning to coding.&lt;/p&gt;
