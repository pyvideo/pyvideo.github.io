routing and how they are being simplified with software defined
networking (SDN) and Open vSwitch (OVS). I will introduce a python
framework called ryu that allows a developer to easily customize and
extend OVS to route network traffic based on their needs. I will demo a
few different topologies and show the code that allows use to customize
routes. Finally I will discuss how we at Rackspace are using this
framework to solve some extremely complex issues.&lt;/p&gt;
