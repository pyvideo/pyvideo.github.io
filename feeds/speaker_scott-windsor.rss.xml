felt repetitive. Python has been great for automating these tasks, with
the goal being to both increase efficiency and remove opportunities for
human error, which can be costly in this business. Automating things has
also taught me that seemingly simple tasks can be more complicated than
they seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this I will discuss libraries that I have found useful,
including ezdxf, which can be used for drafting and creating files that
can be read by CAD software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python really is a programming language for everyone, and can have a use
case in places you might not expect.&lt;/p&gt;
