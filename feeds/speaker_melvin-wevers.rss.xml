This project applies natural language processing, information theory, and time series analysis to examine a coarse-grained representation of the news. The project draws from a wide range of Python packages, which are combined in an adaptable workflow. Rather than highlighting one particular method, I will reflect on the process of constructing a larger workflow and how this can be used for historical research.&lt;/p&gt;
