What are market rates? What's the right structure? Cash, equity, options, benefits? It can be a minefield. In this talk we'll discuss some useful general principles and rules of thumb when thinking about comp, and go through some worked examples to focus the discussion. By the end you'll have a clear picture of the comp landscape, how to think about it, and you'll have some tools to help you make good decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
