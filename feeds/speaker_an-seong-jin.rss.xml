When sharing the content publicly, GitHub is mainly used. Since GitHub is a developer-friendly code management platform, it is not an efficient platform for non-developer decision makers, stakeholders, and others to consume the content. In this session, we will look at how to use Jupyter Book to convert .ipynb files into publication-level results and share them online so that anyone can easily access them.&lt;/p&gt;
