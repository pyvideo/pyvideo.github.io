We will go over how to create automated visual tests that are both scalable and simple to implement.
Most of us will agree that testing CSS changes is importantâ€¦in theory. But when you have limited development time and no QA resources, how do you ensure that pages look as expected after CSS changes? Instead of constantly having to click around we can programmatically detect UI changes

The audience will be expected to have a general understanding about how test cases are set up in Django&lt;/p&gt;
