Through experimentation with educational hardware and software, Obelisk Systems has identified the need for, and developed a brand new framework to allow students (both university and high-school) fluid interaction with complex hardware within classrooms. This framework is further implemented into an API that handles all low-level sensor access whilst maintaining relevance to a wide variety of students.
This API will be used to interface with space experimentation and education hardware being developed by Obelisk Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
