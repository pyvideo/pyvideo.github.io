We've all heard of unittest and pytest, but testing database objects are sometimes forgotten about, or tested through the application. However, pytestâ€™s flexibility along with Python's rich library of modules means that we can accomplish database testing in a way familar to Python developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be exploring how to use PyTest to create a suite of tests for database objects. This will include setting up our testing environment, populating conftest.py with our fixtures, and using transactions to our advantage. As we'll be testing against a real live Microsoft SQL Server database, we'll see how to use pyodbc to set up a connection to it. Then we'll dive into a few tests to show how we can gain confidence in our DB functions and stored procedures. Of course there are alternative ways to do this, and I'll share a few of them along with the benefits and drawbacks of using pytest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If time allows we'll show an Postgres equivalent to illustrate that this approach is not limited to a single product.&lt;/p&gt;
