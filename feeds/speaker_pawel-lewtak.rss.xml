Everybody has some ideas what to do for such a project so it'll be a
good one instead of legacy in a near future. During this talk I want to
share my experience and show what works for me. I'll start from project
analysis and end on deployment and beyond. I want to discuss some common
mistakes and misconceptions and hopefully give you some ideas you could
use for your own project regardless of its size. With a bit of work
some/all could be applied to legacy projects as well.&lt;/p&gt;

It's
cache invalidation and naming things. I want to focus on the second
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see common examples of both good and bad naming. What's the
common part of each of them? What's makes names good? Can we settle
on good enough or should we aim for perfect names? I'll show some of
best and bad practices so you'll be able to recognize both of them
when you make code review for your peers. Naming is one of two
hardest things in CS, so I don't claim to be right about everything
but I'm open to discussion and happy to learn from you as well.&lt;/p&gt;

a command line. I want to focus on command line tools which seem to
be a bit forgotten these days. Let me show a few tools I'm using on
daily basis and how they helped me become more productive. I'll prove
it's possible to start up a new environment from scratch that feels
like $HOME. Finally, I want to convince you how important it is to
constantly challenge yourself and your tools, how useful is a custom
toolbox tailored to you.&lt;/p&gt;
