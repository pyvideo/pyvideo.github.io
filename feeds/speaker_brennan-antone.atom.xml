How can we deliver value directly back to all survey participants, not just top organizational decision-makers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I discuss re-designing how we report on organizational feedback surveys, moving from a top-down to a bottom-up approach to organizational change. Interactive dashboards can make data and feedback accessible to all. This tackles challenges with data quality, privacy, and power - allowing everyone to benefit directly from their data. I examine how Quarto and Shiny enable the creation of &amp;quot;flipped reports&amp;quot;, and describe takeaways from implementing them with two Fortune 500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk teaches how personalized tools can make data accessible to all, and can alter the power dynamics around how organizations enact change.&lt;/p&gt;
