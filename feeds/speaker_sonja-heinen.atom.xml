&lt;p&gt;Firstly this talk offers an introduction to a variety of established as
well as experimental visual documentation methods. Subsequently, it
explores the question whether or not these approaches can be applied to
software documentation in a reasonable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly this talk offers an introduction to a variety of established as
well as experimental visual documentation methods. Subsequently, it
explores the question whether or not these approaches can be applied to
software documentation in a reasonable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard it takes a closer look at individual methods and
estimates their corresponding affordances in terms of time, skill,
resources and potential automatization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, this talk presents an initial attempt to translate existing
docs into visual languages and discusses the according outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily, the objective of reading and writing the docs serves the
purpose to convey clear, unambiguous information, at the same time, the
experience should be as engaging and pleasant as possible. Building a
Visual Documentation Language serves to reach this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
