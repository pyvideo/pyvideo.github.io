&lt;p&gt;Description
The talk provides an overview of the ad tech ecosystem, in particular how ad slots are dynamically populated by way of user behavioral targeting each time a webpage loads. It should be interesting for developers as well as data scientists who are looking to learn about the applications of machine learning in computational advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract
In particular, we will explore how DSPs (demand side platforms) optimize ad campaigns for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus will be on how CTR (click-through-rates) are optimized via real-time-bidding (RTB) models. We will discuss modeling challenges such as how best to handle categorical or imbalanced training data. You will come away with a deeper understanding of the system design trade-offs and be able to deploy models at scale in your own work.&lt;/p&gt;
