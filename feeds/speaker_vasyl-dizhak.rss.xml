&lt;p&gt;Modern geo tools and services gives easy way to track, analyze and store data, generate nice and meaningful visualization, thus it is still a complicated and niche field. The aim of my presentation is to shed light into existing modules and systems that are build with python and can be successfully used for creating geographic services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside that, we will talk about way how to store and analyze spatial data and cover some basics about geo queries, measuring of objects and distances. Hope that you'l find this interesting and have a lot of fun along the way. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;
