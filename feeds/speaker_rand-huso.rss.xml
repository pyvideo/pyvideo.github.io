itself, and largely unnecessary. The solutions proposed by the
developers of MPI and the new languages in this space are all addressing
the problem the way it's always been addressed. What I present is a way
to attack the massively parallel problem that reduces the complexity of
MPI programming to that of implementing a very simple state machine.
I've used this combination of MPI and IoC to write state-of-the-art
applications that run on some of the largest supercomputers around the
world.&lt;/p&gt;
