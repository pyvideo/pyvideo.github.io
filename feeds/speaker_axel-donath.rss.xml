By using deconvolution methods the original signal can be partly restored, however this process is especially challenging in the presence of Poisson noise. We compare existing deconvolution algorithms in the Python ecosystem and compare their performance in the low signal to noise regime against improved methods implemented in a dedicated new Python package called Pylira.&lt;/p&gt;

Gammapy provides methods for the analysis of astronomical gamma-ray data, such as measurement of spectra, images and light curves. By relying on standardized data formats and a joint likelihood framework, it allows astronomers to combine data from multiple instruments and constrain underlying astrophysical emission processes across large parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Finally we will share lessons learned during the journey towards version v1.0 for an openly developed scientific Python package.&lt;/p&gt;
