I will then provide PyMC3 and Theano code to illustrate how to construct Bayesian deep nets and visualize uncertainty in their results.&lt;/p&gt;

You're
on your way to greatness! Now the problem comes: do I do the t-test?
Chi-squared test? How do I decide? In this talk, inspired by many
Pythonista Bayesians (&amp;#64;jakevdp, &amp;#64;allendowney, &amp;#64;twiecki, &amp;#64;fonnesbeck)
before, I will show you how you can take common statistical decision
problems, formulate them as a Bayesian analysis problem, and use PyMC3
as your workhorse tool for gaining insights. This talk will be
math-light and code-heavy, and if you download the slides, you'll have a
simple template for more complex Bayesian analysis down the road!&lt;/p&gt;

avalanching in, and there's always errors cropping up! &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;NaN&lt;/tt&gt;s,
strings where there are supposed to be integers, and more. Moreover,
your team is writing code that is getting reused, but that code is
failing in mysterious places. How do you solve this? Testing is the
answer! In this tutorial, you will gain practical hands-on experience
writing tests in a data science setting so that you can continually
ensure the integrity of your code and data. You will learn how to use
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;py.test&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;coverage.py&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;hypothesis&lt;/tt&gt; to write better tests
for your code.&lt;/p&gt;

LinkedIn make friend recommendations? Or how epidemiologists track down
patient zero in an outbreak? If so, then this tutorial is for you. In
this tutorial, we will use a variety of datasets to help you understand
the fundamentals of network thinking, with a particular focus on
constructing, summarizing, and visualizing complex networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered about how those data scientists at Facebook and LinkedIn make friend recommendations? Or how epidemiologists track down patient zero in an outbreak? If so, then this tutorial is for you. In this upgraded version of last year's tutorial, we will explore a variety of network analysis problems, including graph construction, traversal, and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
