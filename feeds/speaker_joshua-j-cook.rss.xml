However, it takes a great deal of time and effort to organize all these outputs so that our findings can enter the patient setting. Quarto can change that. It's a tool that lets us efficiently create various polished formats from a single source while meeting diverse submission requirements. This talk will showcase how Quarto can revolutionize our communication, making research more impactful and speeding up the delivery of treatments to our patients.&lt;/p&gt;
