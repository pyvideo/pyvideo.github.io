&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the talk What is Flask? Is it any better than Django? Can I use
Flask on Google AppEngine? Fortunately, during the course of this talk I
will not have to answer any of these questions. This talk is a showcase
of our experience with using Flask to build flexible and scalable web
service and it focuses strongly on Flask and Flask extensions’
internals. Who should come to this talk Basically anybody who’s looking
to invest into learning Flask or already started using Flask. Even
though this talk focuses strongly on Flask-related topics, it also
raises important points relevant to any web development framework or
library. Abstract Introduction What we’re building Why we chose Flask
Flask RESTful APIs and Flask.route() Scaling Exploring Flask-Celery
Monitoring Celery logging: Oh, my! Scaling Celery Flask-SQLAlchemy
Migrations Sharding and master/slave setup Celery and SQLAlchemy:
unexpected issues Performance analysis Using werkzeug’s profiler
Integrating with statsd Investigating cache usage patterns Summary&lt;/p&gt;
