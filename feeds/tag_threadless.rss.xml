&lt;p&gt;Presented by Chris McAvoy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threadless is a 10 year old community based design company with an
overpowering love of witty t-shirts and a mission to 'inspire
awesomeness.' After 10 years of working primarily with PHP, Threadless
has decided to use Python as our base development language. The decision
was 10% technical and 90% touchy feely. We know what a powerful
community can do to a product, and see the same sort of drive and
passion in the Python community that we see in our own design community.
Python is the peanut butter to our jelly. We're excited to share our
jelly with you. Chris McAvoy, VP of Technology at Threadless (and the
founder of the Chicago Python Users Group), will share a bit about the
companies history, the role of technology in supporting the community at
the core of the business, and why Python and Threadless are going to be
totally BFF's.&lt;/p&gt;
