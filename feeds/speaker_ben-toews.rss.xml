He will be talking
about some of the basics as well as trying to compare it with other
concurrency options. The focus will be on its application in a few
recent projects as well as a comparison of Python's gevent and node.js.
Some of the demos will also be using matplotlib in honor of John
Hunter's passing.&lt;/p&gt;
