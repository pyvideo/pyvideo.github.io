trans women) and their friends who are looking to learn how to program
in a friendly non-alpha-geek environment. The material on the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pystar.org/"&gt;http://pystar.org&lt;/a&gt; site was originally developed
by the Boston Python Workshop which was held March 4/5, 2011. Currently
PyStar events use a mix of badges from the PyStar site and their own
curriculum. As this project continues hopefully this site will be a hub
of learning materials geared at all levels of Python learners, with a
focus on teaching people in a safe and supportive manner.&lt;/p&gt;
