&lt;p&gt;The recording was interrupted when a display cable was pulled, but the first portion of the talk outlines most of the parts and process are included so we decided to publish it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: requirement.txt should have been requirements.txt (with an s character). This was an oversight and fixed later in the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
