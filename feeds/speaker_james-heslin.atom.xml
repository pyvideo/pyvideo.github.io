shrink, the ability to deliver features and fixes in near real-time
becomes more crucial. Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines can enable
teams to deliver code quickly but optimisation of the Build, Test and
Deploy stages can be the difference between a 10 minute deployment and a
5 hour deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Demonware we are using Docker to optimise the Test Stage of our CD
pipelines. Containerised testing has helped us reduce test execution
time, make tests more portable, better utilize our test infrastructure
and deliver game services to our customers faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover some of the challenges we faced along the way and
the various approaches we used to containerise our tests.&lt;/p&gt;
