&lt;p&gt;Even though open-source collaborators and code reviewers are needed more than ever, the few git learning resources that focus on these subjects are not beginner friendly. This is a missed opportunity! As the DjangoCon US Website Chair, I review pull requests submitted to the website repo. This has given me the opportunity to develop a beginner-friendly, best practice GitHub workflow. I can jumpstart your collaboration and code review skills by sharing what Iâ€™ve learned with you. This talk is for anyone, but one of my goals in giving it is to encourage other women to take leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;
