&lt;p&gt;Harnessing the power of machine intelligence to empower users with advanced and smarter banking solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking has been the one of the most ancient professions for humans. Yet, when it comes to advanced or smart banking solutions we havenâ€™t experienced a radical shift even in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, at Number26, aim to enrich that experience and provide an advanced, mobile banking platform for our customers. Each of our features, revolves around users - their interests and personal preferences.
We achieve such flexibility by the use of state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical learning methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, we would like to present a deeper insight into two major features we use in our product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="loweralpha simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automatic real time categorisation of transactions: how we combine the power of the cloud computing service (AWS), with the intelligence of machine learning based models to achieve this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;predictive modelling of users future financial status: how artificial neural networks do the smart thinking for our users to come up his predicted personal finances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech stack ranges from Python (Keras, scikit-learn and more), Dockers, AWS lambda, EBS, NLP (stanford nltk) and machine learning classifiers and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we would like to make the message clear, how machine learning can make even the age old traditional ways of banking a fun.&lt;/p&gt;
