and scope of this space is poorly understood through conventional
classification systems and datasets. This is not only important for
economists but for the people affected by Government policy. In this
talk, we will provide an overview of the work Growth Intelligence has
done in generating our own classification system to describe businesses
using web-based data and python tools and techniques â€“ including the
challenges we still face. We will also look at some situations in which
traditional methods fall short of a data driven approach.&lt;/p&gt;
