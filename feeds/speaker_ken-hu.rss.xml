steadily building itself into a billion dollar industry. With companies
such as Salesforce spearheading the adaption of business SaaS products
in corporate, startups are rising to take on the SME market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With hot topics such as &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;machine learning&amp;quot; flying around,
it may seem overwhelming to put an idea into action. I will walk through
the process of building an data analytics minimum viable product (MVP).
Attendees will have hands on experiences with the free and/or affordable
technology and services that can get their MVP up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk assumes attendees understand the basic of Python. Basic
understanding of MapReduce and NoSQL databases will be big pluses as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a data scientist, software developer, and aspiring entrepreneur.
I'm especially interested in machine learning, information retrieval,
text analytics, and cloud technology. My weapon of choice is Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I previously founded a social data analysis company and developed its
core technology. I grew the startup into a profitable entity, without
any outside funding.&lt;/p&gt;
