provide product recommendations, and prevent homicides (and other
things). This talk will introduce the theory behind network analysis and
showcase the flexibility of Python's NetworkX library. No knowledge of
network analysis (or Mean Girls) is needed, but basic knowledge of
Python and the iPython Notebook, will be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
