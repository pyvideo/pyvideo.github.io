and organised, the availability to the general public or data mining by
volunteers is recent. Sources are varied and may be issued from free
software people or volunteer communities, public data or industry. This
presentation will aim to draw up a balance sheet of available data,
mainly in France and the Mediterranean sea and also what can be done
with this data and perspectives within the context of sailing
navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
