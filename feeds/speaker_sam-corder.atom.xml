&lt;p&gt;Presented by Sam Corder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your RDBMS not coping with the load anymore and can't be scaled out
any further? Are you designing the next big thing and know your RDBMS
won't be able to handle it? Are you tired of shoe-horning a data model
into where it doesn't belong? Are you just curious what this thing
called MongoDB is? In this session you will explore a popular
alternative to the RDBMS called Mongo from one who has battled with BSON
to write the original .Net driver. You'll learn basics of schema design,
document manipulation, several ways to get at your data, something odd
called map/reduce and all from the comfort of Python and the slightly
uncomfortable IronPython.&lt;/p&gt;
