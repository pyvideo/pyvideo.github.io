The Django framework is quite well known. It is a extremely quick and easy way to develop web sites and apps. Backed by strong developer community and wealth of knowledge available online, it is natural first choice for web-development. But in this case, we use it as an excellent web-app back-end which we drive a mobile front-end.
Sencha is fast becoming an important framework for developing mobile apps which runs elegantly on both Android and iPhone. With almost native API like look and feel, it works like a charm on Android and iPhone platform reducing development time dramatically.
I will try to address the classic problem of disconnect between mobile and web-apps. Putting the system of producing both within single development cycle. Using django-piston as center piece library. We will use extensively to create well defined APIs. These APIs will in turn be used with Sencha based front-ends.
Extending further we will take a look at integration testing of this framework towards creating a rock solid mobile experience. This will be followed by discussion on merits of using browser over native app frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
