&lt;p&gt;Despite the government's best efforts, students are being turned off
when it comes to engaging with computer science. The number of students
opting for the new Computer Science GCSE and A-Levels is lower than
previous figures for ICT. In addition, the gender gap has widened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2017, 54% of UK schools were not even offering Computer Science as
a GCSE option. With motivation for the subject low, student numbers
declining and the digital skills gap increasing, a solution must be
found to enthuse students and increase engagement with computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be introducing teachers to initiatives including after-school
clubs, creative classroom projects and classroom displays that inspire
and get students talking about the amazing and exciting side of
computing to re-enter inspire and engage them with the subject we love.&lt;/p&gt;
