&lt;div class="line"&gt;We humans are the masterpieces. We are born with awesome capabilities
and applaudable talents making us different from one another. As an
individual , nobody thinks the way others do , they have their own
intriguing ways to look at this world. Few of us have this exceptional
quality to be able to visualise sounds and map colours with the words.
It is termed as Synesthesia. It is fascinating to know how human brain
can see sounds and hear colours, how it thinks of a word, and sees
blocks of colours, and then these blocks get translated into letters.
There are few who see the letters with a halo-effect. The letters
give- off almost a glow of a certain colour.It is a striking fact that
the synesthetic brains are wired a little differently from the ones of
non-synesthetes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This talk will cover the interesting applications of python
programming by harnessing simple mathematical techniques to simulate
the synesthetic ( bridging modalities) behaviour of brain. It is
really appealing to be able to look at the world wearing colourful
shades and building an AI that does bridge these modalities (vision ,
hearing ,etc ) is truly astounding. The talk covers an interesting
viewpoint on how python can be used widely to analyse some of the
really complex human brain behaviours ,in addition to solving
comparatively trivial real world problems.&lt;/div&gt;
