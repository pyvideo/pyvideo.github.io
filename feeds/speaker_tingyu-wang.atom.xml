Get lost, calculus! Conventional presentations of linear algebra in undergraduate STEM curricula are overly focused on rules and memorization, overloaded with nomenclature, and slowed down by pen-and-paper methods. This tutorial skips the rule-based procedures and instead uses a visualization-rich approach and computation with NumPy to illuminate the concepts and usefulness of linear algebra. We promise a launching pad for participants to venture into this subject and continue learning after, with a solid conceptual grasp and none of the slog. You don't need previous experience in the subject; some recollection of having learned about matrices and linear systems of equations could help, but is not required.&lt;/p&gt;
