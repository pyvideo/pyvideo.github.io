After mostly seeing “hello-world on Lambda” tutorials, I was curious how it would work for a real application with a frontend and a database. This talk reviews my experience using AWS Lambda for full-stack web applications. If you’re familiar with the theory and want to know more about how it works in practice, you’re in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
