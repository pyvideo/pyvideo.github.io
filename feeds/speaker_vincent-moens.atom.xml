For this reason, people often revert to packaged solutions with single entry points and complex configurations that leave little room for custom development. We present a new RLHF support in TorchRL that solves this problem by giving developers users full control over the training pipeline at a reduced development cost on the RL side. This new set of primitives allow users to quickly prototype and train generative models across domains (language, CV and others). With the TorchRL-HF tooling, RL-specific classes and recipes are easily blended within one's code base, and multiple solutions (preprocessing techniques or RL algorithms) can seamlessly be implemented without the need for an in-depth understanding of the RL machinery. We demonstrate how this works in practice with examples from diverse domains, including LLMs and drug design.&lt;/p&gt;
