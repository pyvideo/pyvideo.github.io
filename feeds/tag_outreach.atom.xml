school students: the National Computer Science School
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ncss.edu.au"&gt;http://www.ncss.edu.au&lt;/a&gt;) and the Girls' Programming Network
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sydney.edu.au/it/gpn"&gt;http://sydney.edu.au/it/gpn&lt;/a&gt;). For the past four years we have been
teaching Python to students in grades 9-12, and based on this experience
we will discuss why Python is a good first language and the parts of it
which are still difficult for students to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Asheesh Laroia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups like the Fedora Design Team, Dreamwidth, SF Ruby, and OpenHatch
have discovered the power of outreach to bring in new contributors. In
the past year, SF Ruby grew in numbers as well as in diversity, moving
from 3% women to 18% women. Because most projects need ongoing help,
this talk discusses effective strategies for bringing in contributors
who stick around for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is targeted at anyone involved in an open source project who
wants to find more contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programs like Google Summer of Code often provide excited students who
disappear after a summer's work. Meanwhile, request for help emails on
development lists are typically met with silence. Hackathons create a
flurry of commits, but then we never hear from the participants again.
Expanding your team is possible, and it requires care in terms of
outreach, expectation management, and mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss three major forms of outreach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-on-one check-ins with participants,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodic drives to bring in new contributors, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-person teaching events. Each one has &amp;quot;do&amp;quot;s and &amp;quot;don't&amp;quot;s associated
with it. This talk digests the experience of effective outreach into
practical strategies that you can re-use within your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
