languages out there, but it is still a programming language. It still
has syntax, data types, and some occasional dark corners. Python “warts”
are things for which people have criticised Python, typically aspects of
the language or mechanisms of its implementation, because such aspects
either expose certain surprising inconsistencies, are regarded as
omissions, or cause irritation for parts of the community in some sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be about common pitfalls (termed warts/landmines) that
people face using Python programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
