See pybay.com for more details about PyBay and click SHOW MORE for information about this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DESCRIPTION
In this talk we discuss why the polyglot approach to development is sometimes not only necessary but inevitable. We will discuss the benefits to this approach as well as the downsides that can be a challenge to overcome. We will discuss how Python specifically fits into a polyglot design pattern and why it could help bridge gaps in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the language you prefer to develop in, theres a place for you in the polyglot architecture I will cover. Come learn how you can superpower the innovation and agility of your application development using modern open source tools!&lt;/p&gt;
