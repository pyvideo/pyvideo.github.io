Thanks to Python's incredible runtime flexibility, this can be done. In this talk, we will explore how changes to source code files can be integrated into running programs, covering as many edge cases as possible and explaining the intrinsic limitations of the approach. We will also demonstrate Jurigged, a flexible and extensible working implementation of this system.&lt;/p&gt;
