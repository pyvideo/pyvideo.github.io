have we become redundant. Running multiple experiments in single machine
&amp;amp; waiting for tasks to complete cannot be time-efficient for big
datasets. Hence, we need an automation which can take over repetitive
manual tasks &amp;amp; spare us the time to do other important stuff. Aim is to
show how to deploy ML architecture in 60 SECONDS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ML pipeline consists of many manual tasks such as Data collection, Data
cleaning, training environment setup, training configuration, monitoring
progress or model evaluation gig, all these components should be
automated &amp;amp; what you should be left with is just a single CONFIGURATION
document with information of different set of experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
