Erlang/Python based Map/Reduce framework that's small, fast, elegant,
understandable. We needed a way to tame the power of Disco and that's
when we came up with the Inferno project which takes even more
complexity out of Map/Reduce. With Inferno you concentrate about what
you want from your data and not the underlying complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
