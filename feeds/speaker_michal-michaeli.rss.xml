And though the rise in technology and coding in our life is undeniable – women still take less than 20% of jobs in technology, less than 10% of startup entrepreneurs and not even 15% coders. Those numbers matter cause they tell a story and based on it we can discuss if that is how we want/need it to be. And if not – what can be done to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
