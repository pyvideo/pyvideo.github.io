scientific research. Usually they are generated with scripts (either
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.py or&lt;/tt&gt;.ipynb`), and a natural way of maintaining these scripts is
using either a long script file or multiple short files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one has to update these outputs, the usual workflow is: 1) find the
file(s) and code block(s) inside the file that contains the code for
output generation, 2) re-learn what you did so you can edit the code,
and 3) run the code to generate new outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these steps has a cognitive overhead (non-fluency), which
hampers your productivity, especially if it has been a while since you
looked at them. Using IPython Notebook facilitates some of the
procedures but it does not solve everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I introduce org-mode and some of its functionalities for
all three steps. org-mode is ideal for managing these tasks because it
can minimize the non-fluency. It has a convenient and flexible markup
syntax for hierarchical documents. It uses tree-like headlines, which
make it very easy to organize code and text. It provides a convenient
way to collapse or expand headline blocks and navigate through them. In
addition, one can execute a code block or export the results (or the
source code itself) conveniently inside org-mode. Theoretically, one can
have the entire contents and code for a paper and a presentation inside
one org file. I show examples of how one can leverage these
functionalities to maintain outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
