Starting with PyTorch 2.0, we have further enhanced this feature by addressing several issues and optimizing the bfloat16 precision path. The dynamic shape path is also supported, which allows users to get good performance on dynamic shape models, such as GPTJ and Llama, as well as using low precision bfloat16 data type to further improve performance on the 4th generation of Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (Sapphire Rapids) using Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) instruction set extension and lower memory footprint. In this topic, we will introduce the key optimization technologies used in the CPU inference path of torch.compile, such as GEMM fusions, vectorization of low precision bfloat16 path, and constant folding with freezing path. We will also discuss how to solve issues that arose when supporting the path of the dynamic shape. Currently, the dynamic shape and bfloat16 paths can work well as static shape path. The geometric mean speedup of the bfloat16 path can range from 1.4x to 2.3x compared to eager mode on Sapphire Rapids.&lt;/p&gt;

We will discuss new features and performance enhancements, including: • Max-autotune support with codegen for GEMMs, boosting performance for GEMM-related operations • Enhanced vectorized codegen support, now covering all data types beyond floating points with flexible vector factors, and optimized loop scheduling • Comprehensive quantization support, including weight-only-quantization (WoQ), and optimizations for dynamic quantization and quantization-aware training • Improved Attention support, featuring attention masks and optimizating SoftMax via flash attention v2 etc. • AOTInductor support, enabling high-performance inference with frozen weights • Native Windows support, with improved vectorization capabilities These advancements, combined with ongoing optimizations, have resulted in significant performance improvements since PyTorch 2.1, demonstrated through extensive benchmarks and large language models (LLMs).&lt;/p&gt;
