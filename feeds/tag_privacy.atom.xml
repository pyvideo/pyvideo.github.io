&lt;p&gt;HTTP is the foundation of the current web, and HTTP/3 is the upcoming major version of it. The new version is built on top of the QUIC transport protocol, originally developed in Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP/3 can change the Internet as we know it today. Since its beginning in the 90s, HTTP transfers data over TCP to ensure reliable connections between clients and servers. QUIC is a TCP alternative, reimplemented on top of unreliable and connectionless UDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proprietary Google implementation of QUIC is deployed worldwide and supported by Chrome browsers. Future HTTP/3 will be hopefully standardized by IETF soon, but many diverse implementations are available already today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP/3 improves performance and increases privacy. The switch from TCP to QUIC allows us to address the inherent limitations of previous HTTP versions. The QUIC protocol is completely encrypted, including traffic control headers, which are visible in TCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk introduces HTTP/3 and the underlaying QUIC protocol. It shows both advantages and disadvantages of the new technology, and it describes the landscape of the current implementations and suggests what you can try today.&lt;/p&gt;

research and development of tools for online anonymity and privacy of
its users while surfing the Internet, by establishing virtual circuits
between the different nodes that make up the Tor network. In addition,
we will review how Tor works from anonymity point of view, preventing
websites from tracking you. Python help us to automate the process to
search an discover hidden services thanks to packages like
requests,requesocks and sockspy. At this point we will review the
crawling process and show tools in python ecosystem available for this
task such as Deep Explorer(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/blueudp/deep-explorer"&gt;https://github.com/blueudp/deep-explorer&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These could be the talking points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to Tor project and hidden services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discovering hidden services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modules and packages we can use in python for connecting with Tor
network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools that allow search hidden services and atomate the crawling
process in Tor network&lt;/li&gt;

this affecting the field of Machine Learning? This is what this talk
will cover. We first expose the attack surface of systems deploying
machine learning. We then describe how an attacker may force models to
make wrong predictions with very little information about the victim.
One such attack can be biometric recognition where fake biometric traits
may be exploited to impersonate a legitimate user. We demonstrate that
these attacks are practical against existing machine learning as a
service platform. Towards the end, we will discuss current research to
defend models from such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

malicious attackers further exacerbates this problem. We, as developers,
owe it to ourselves and to our communities to do the best we can to

&lt;p&gt;Attendees of this talk will walk away with a thorough understanding of
the following topics and the problems they solve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multi-factor authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encrypted DNS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSH/VPN tunnels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;full disk encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compartment isolation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“onion-skin” routing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, digital interactions with other people increasingly occur
via hosted services, which while convenient can compromise the privacy,
integrity, and control of our data. With some open-source software and
inexpensive virtual servers, we can take back control and empower us all
to securely share our lives with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
