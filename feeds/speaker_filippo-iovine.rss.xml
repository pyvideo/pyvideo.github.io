- PyCon Italia 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REST In Peace (RIP) is an Odoo module to ease the
development/implementantion of REST services into Odoo using the RIP API
framework library or, without a single line of code, just thru the Odoo
RIP backend settings interface RIP has two easy approaches in producing
a REST server exposing Odoo models data structure and Odoo models method
as REST API services: you can do that by code (the RIP API framework
library) or using Odoo RIP backend configuration interface where you can
define access rules (which models are exposed, who users can access what
and how, which http methods, specific blocking rules, etc.), set models
schema IN and OUT being parsed and validated when invoking the request
or being rendered in the HTTP responses, write your own fuction and
expose that as a REST API service, choose custom HTTP responses data
layouts, requests and responses logs, auth token handlers, etc,
potentially whithout developing one single line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
