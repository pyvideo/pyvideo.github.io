These new methodologies go hand in hand with an exponential growth in data volumes and rates - petabyte scale data collections and terabyte/sec. At the same time scientists are pushing for a paradigm shift. As they can now observe processes in intricate details, they want to analyze, interpret and control those processes. Given the multitude of voluminous, heterogenous data streams involved in every single experiment, novel real time, data driven analysis and decision support approaches are needed to realize their vision. This talk will discuss state of the art streaming analysis for experimental facilities, its challenges and early successes. It will present where commercial technologies can be leveraged and how many of the novel approaches differ from commonly available solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

Our search engine allows the user to take a photo of a room and retrieve with a high recall a list of items identical or visually similar to those present in the photo. Additionally, it allows to return other items that aesthetically and stylistically fit well together. To achieve this goal, our system blends the results obtained using textual and visual modalities. Thanks to this blending strategy, we increase the average style similarity score of the retrieved items by 11%.&lt;/p&gt;

You would probably run &amp;quot;python&amp;quot; to use its OS and network features undetected, just like real attackers do. If someone did it on your network, would you notice? PEP 551 makes it so that admins can audit Python and detect malicious use on their systems. This session will look at why we need it and how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll talk about the evolution of our thinking and policies over the past five years, and make a case for why other companies should make a commitment to the open source ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

Model-agnostic interpretability promises to regain interpretability without sacrificing accuracy. I introduce LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), conceptually and applied to a classification problem: whether couples are likely to stay together, or not.&lt;/p&gt;
