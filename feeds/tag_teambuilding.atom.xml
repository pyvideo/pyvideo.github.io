And as anyone who as worked on a team knows, there’s often a lot more that goes into working together to build that product than actually just building the product itself. A highly functional team is not as elusive it may seem. Software engineering is a skill we’ve developed, but even more importantly software engineering on teams is another skill we’ve been practicing and improving on as an industry. Software engineering principles and best practices may seem to have very little to do with teamwork, but being able to thoughtfully apply some of what we’ve learned as engineers towards teamwork, we can help move towards creating such success with our teams.&lt;/p&gt;
