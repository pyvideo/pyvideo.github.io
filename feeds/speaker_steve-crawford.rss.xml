facility in South Africa. Since the start of science operations in
September 2011, it has produced a wide range of scientific results from
studies of near-Earth asteroids to galaxies at the edge of the Universe.
Once observations are obtained at the telescope, they are passed through
our science pipeline, which is built on Python. The pipeline rapidly
distributes the data, provides science quality reductions, and monitors
the performance of the telescope. In addition, developments made for
SALT have also contributed to astropy, a python library for astronomy.
In this talk, we highlight how these developments are helping to
contribute to our understanding of the Universe. We describe how we are
using python to provide rapid reductions of the observations, for
teaching new students, and for solving new problems.&lt;/p&gt;
