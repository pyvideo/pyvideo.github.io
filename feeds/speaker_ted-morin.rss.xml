Mirabai Knight, a true geek, was so frustrated after she became a professional stenographer that she hired a developer to help her make a FOSS steno solution. Now, the open steno community exists with her passion driving them forward. At the core is Plover, the free software that lets anyone try and learn stenography for free. Around it there are helper tools, learning resources, open hardware initiatives, and more. Ted manages the GitHub repository and is a student of the Open Steno Project himself. He will talk about Open Steno, where it came from, what it was like before it existed, what it's good for, how it works (as a Python application), and where it may go in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
