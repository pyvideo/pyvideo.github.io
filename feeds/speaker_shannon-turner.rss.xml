Here's how to teach like one.</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2018/youre-an-expert-heres-how-to-teach-like-one.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to code and being able to teach it are two separate skills. When we have expertise in a subject, it's common to take for granted that we'll be able to effectively communicate our expertise to someone else. Come learn (or re-learn!) how to teach and discover practical examples you can put to work right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sharpening your teaching skills, you'll be a more effective mentor, trainer, and team member.&lt;/p&gt;
