model. Feature Engineering is the process of creating features from raw
data and selecting the best features for a model. However, it is not
just a tool for Data Scientists - Data Analysts and Developers can use
it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we will create features that can be used for creating
Data Visualizations, Rules Based Automations, and Machine Learning
Models. Attendees will learn how to explore, create and select features
from various data types such as “discrete/categorical” and “continuous”
data. Attendees will learn techniques such as One-hot encodings for
categories, text vectorization, date manipulation and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial, attendees will understand how to create
features for their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
