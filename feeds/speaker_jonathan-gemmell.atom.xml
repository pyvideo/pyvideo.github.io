motivate them. In this talk we will first discuss Kaggle, a platform for
predictive modelling and analytics competitions on which companies and
researchers post their data and statisticians and data miners from all
over the world compete to produce the best models. In particular, we
will discuss the West Nile Virus Prediction challenge and how it is
being used in the classroom. Finally, this talk will get interested
competitors started with some sample code.&lt;/p&gt;
