When it comes to machine learning projects, verifying and trusting model performance results is a particularly grueling challenge. This talk will explore both how we can use Python to instill confidence in model metrics and the best way to keep models versioned to increase transparency and accessibility across the team. The tactics demonstrated will help developers save precious development time and increase transparency by incorporating metric tracking early on.
