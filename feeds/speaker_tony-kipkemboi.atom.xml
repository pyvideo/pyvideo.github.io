strategies to build robust, performant web apps in Python. Participants
are welcome to bring their own app ideas to implement during this
tutorial, but they will also have the opportunity to follow along as we
build an example app together. The example app is a multi-page dashboard
focused on your GitHub historical activity that also allows you to
explore this data through a chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intended audience of this talk is Python developers with the desire
to build robust web applications using only Python – no HTML, CSS, or
JavaScript required. Some experience with Streamlit will be helpful but
is not a prerequisite. Attendees will walk away with practical knowledge
of advanced Streamlit usage including performance optimization through
caching, session state management, and app testing.&lt;/p&gt;
