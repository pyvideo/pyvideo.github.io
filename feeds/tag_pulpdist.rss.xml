validator. This could be seen as an unusual choice, so it's worth
exploring the way this approach came to be adopted. Practicing iterative
development means coping with the tension between &amp;quot;doing the simplest
thing that could possibly work&amp;quot; to meet immediate project requirements
and avoiding &amp;quot;reinventing the wheel&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PulpDist project uses SQL Alchemy as part of a custom JSON
validator. This could be seen as an unusual choice, so it's worth
exploring the way this approach came to be adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practicing iterative development means coping with the inevitable
tension between &amp;quot;doing the simplest thing that could possibly work&amp;quot; to
meet immediate project requirements and avoiding &amp;quot;reinventing the wheel&amp;quot;
in order to take full advantage of existing software components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that iterative software designs are inevitably path
dependent: decisions made in early iterations can shape later aspects of
a project in unexpected ways. These early influences may even predate
the project itself, instead being a consequence of wider organisational
policies and the personal preferences and abilities of key developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding some of these factors can help with understanding why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; is usually a better target than &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Not Invented Here&amp;quot; syndrome is not always the villain it is
frequently made out to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the need to extensively rewrite existing components is not always a
sign of past failure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
