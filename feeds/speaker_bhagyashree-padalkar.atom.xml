conception one year ago. Amongst other things we at CommOps are
trying to build tools to understand the community and make it more
contributor-friendly. While newcomer onboarding is important for any
FOSS community, retaining them is critical. We have been working on
improving the contributor retention rates in Fedora Community for a
while now. In this direction, we have built some Python-based scripts
to understand the activity of Fedora contributors and their life
cycles. We have also tried to analyze contribution activity of some
successful contributors and find common patterns in their behavior
and have tried to measure the impact of attending FOSS events on the
activity of a contributor and on the Fedora community as a whole. All
this work has been done using Python and during this talk, I want to
share details about the tools we have built, how we built them and
the insights we have generated from them.&lt;/p&gt;
