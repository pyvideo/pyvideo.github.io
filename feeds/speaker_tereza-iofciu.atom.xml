While this growth has been exciting, it has also brought new challenges and opportunities to improve our global community. Through this panel, we would like to address those challenges and understand our community better.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of this work requires lots of interactions. If the interactions are about OSS, these would be mostly in English, and although good communication skills are essential, they can also be gatekeeping sometimes. After describing the state of diversity in OSS and in Python I showing some thoughts about how we can build a better communication culture in the Python local and global communities. Why it is important to rethink Code of Conducts, what are the current problems with how people think of Code of Conducts. We can use these as a tool for building more inclusive Python communities. These are reflections stemming from my involvement over the past years in the Python community.&lt;/p&gt;

and representation among its members. There are examples of success
stories such as PyCon US Charlas, PyLadies, Djangonaut, and Django
Girls. Yet in the Python podcast community, women are still
underrepresented, making up only 17% of invited guests among the popular
podcast series. Being a guest in a podcast is a privilege, and an
opportunity to influence the Python community. There are many women and
underrepresented group members who have made impactful contributions to
the Python community globally, and they deserve the recognition and to
be heard by the rest of us. Disheartened by the lack of representation
by women on Python podcasts, and inspired by others who have shown us
how diversity in the community can be improved through intentionality,
we decided to start a podcast with a goal to highlight their voices so
that they could receive the recognition they deserve. In this talk,earn
about them, and about our podcast series. We’ll also share how you can
further help out cause in improving representation and diversity in the
Python community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="goal"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Goal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To raise awareness of the underrepresentation of certain groups,
especially women. To acknowledge the progress made by the Python
community and what can be done further to continue the improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="target-audience"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Target Audience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who cares about the diversity and inclusion progression in the
Python community. Community leaders who want to be allies.&lt;/p&gt;

The fun part about data science is that no two people really agree on the definition of the data scientist role. So how does the role of product manager in data science look like?&lt;/p&gt;
