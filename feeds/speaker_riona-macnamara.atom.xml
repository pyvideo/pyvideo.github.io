Last year, we were inspired to action by a presentation at Write the Docs. This talk will tell the story of what happened next: how, in two quarters, we worked with a small self-forming team of amazing writers and engineers to build a platform in six months is well on the way to becoming a part of the standard Google engineering workflow. We’ll share how that platform transformed our role as technical writers and our relationship with engineering. We’ll cover design and implementation details, but we’ll also talk about our experience - how we learned that being audacious (but not reckless), focused (but open and generous), and unafraid could revitalize our whole approach to work and save us from burnout.
We&amp;amp;#39;ll talk about our ever-growing appetite for disruption: How it changed beyond recognition our relationships with engineers, fellow writers, and senior leadership, making us fall in love again with our roles as documentarians.&lt;/p&gt;

out” and exposed? Imposter syndrome is corrosive. It holds us back at
work - especially in an industry where we can feel constantly under
review by talented peers - and erodes our happiness. And the subject
always comes up whenever technical writers gather; sometimes it feels
like the very definition of a technical writer is “One who experiences
imposter syndrome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this? The first, shorter part of this talk will cover some
research and insights into why we, as documentarians, may be especially
susceptible to imposter syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the field of tech writing is experiencing a swerve: a tipping point
- a sea change in direction. There will always be a demand for &amp;quot;&amp;quot;old&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
tech writing, but many of us will have to adapt to this new environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second, forward-looking part of this talk, I’ll argue that being
an “imposter” has its advantages during such a time of change. The very
factors that contribute to our self-doubt are actually the qualities
that will enable us to thrive as our role inexorably evolves to take on
new, unsolved challenges in engineering information. The keys to our
success: apophenia (the ability to see connections between seemingly
random collections of information), empathy, and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our future is bright if we pay attention to our new opportunities
instead of that nagging voice in our heads.&lt;/p&gt;

Accuracy? Style? Format? No! A great documentation set is one that meets
its objectives, and sometimes the barrier to greatness is not
dedication, skill, or passion, but a reluctance to let things go. Every
document we publish should reach a certain quality threshold - but that
threshold varies depending on its audience, the maturity of the project,
and the overall project goals. What matters is not that docs are
perfect, but that they are &lt;em&gt;good enough&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how to determine if a doc is &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot;? This talk will cover how
to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define document quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish an appropriate quality bar for a document or doc set&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine if a document meets that bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're all overloaded. We're all stretched for time. Every hour we spend
making a doc better than it needs to be is an hour stolen from other
projects where we could have more impact. Choosing &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot; doesn't
mean we're lowering our standards; it means we're choosing &lt;em&gt;appropriate&lt;/em&gt;
standards and prioritizing correctly. Don't let the perfect be the enemy
of the good.&lt;/p&gt;
