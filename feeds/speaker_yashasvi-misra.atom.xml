&lt;p&gt;By Yashasvi Misra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I owe both my personal and professional growth to communities. As an engineering student in computer science, the first open tech community I joined was PyLadies. I have since then been actively involved in the Python community, always trying to learn and grow. Little did I expect how beneficial that would be. In this session, I will share my journey with the Python community, the impact it had on me, and how it boosted my self-confidence. If you don’t know where to start, join me to explore what I have learned so far.&lt;/p&gt;
