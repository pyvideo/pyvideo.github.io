Practitioners and researchers have recently begun applying them to other general natural language processing applications. The convolution layers in a neural network operate by passing a kernel transformation over adjacent features such as words or pixels. This enables the convolution layer to 'learn' features such as expressions where the meaning of a phrase is dependant upon its context. Stacking multiple convolution layers enables the network to detect higher order features which further processing such as a densely connected feed forward layer can use for purposes such as classification of sentiment, legal context, etc..&lt;/p&gt;
