We’ll start with a retro-chic command-line task management tool named ‘ado’, and create a beautifully modern D3-based interactive task explorer (no server necessary). Learn how powerful documentation-driven development can be, and the benefits of freeing documentation and reporting from their usual separate silos. In this talk we will simultaneously document Bash, Python, SQL, CSS, HTML and JavaScript using HTML, PDF, epub, Excel and .docx formats (with just a single command!). You’ll learn about Dexy, the document and data automation tool that makes this possible by working alongside the documentation tools you already know and love.&lt;/p&gt;
