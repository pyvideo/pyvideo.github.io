delivered earlier this year, exploring and sharing my experience
throughout that journey, from preparation to delivery, by recreating a
simple yet engaging enough game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that I'll both demonstrate several Python related techniques and
tools many may not be aware of, on one hand, and, on the other, extract
provocative questions about general learning processes, especially when
targeted at professional developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promise zero slides and a somewhat fast-paced live (re)coding session,
intertwined with comments on good/bad techniques, along with a
surprising exploration of the turtle module in the Standard Library --
it is more capable than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrap up with a self-code review and with thoughts on how such a game
could be improved, what implications that could have for both beginners
and seasoned professionals: should you do this at work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting 10 minute Q&amp;amp;A / discussion by the end!&lt;/p&gt;
