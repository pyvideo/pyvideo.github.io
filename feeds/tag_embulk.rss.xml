&lt;p&gt;Python is a great tool for performing data analysis, but often time the hardest part is getting access to your data thatâ€™s located in a variety of business systems - files, database, and SaaS applications. Productionizing this process is even harder: scripts frequently fail and require precious to to fix and re-test. In this talk, I will review some open source tools I authored and show you how&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How we created a data collection tool that can read any chaotically formatted files called &amp;quot;CSV&amp;quot; by guessing its structure automatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore the plugin-based-architecture that makes it easy to load data from external sources and publish to production systems. From files to business systems such as Salesforce &amp;amp; Mixpanel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review current plugins (over 100 released by the OSS community) and use cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain how distributed execution enhances stability and scalability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
