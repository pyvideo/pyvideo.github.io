that relies heavily on human judgement. Despite that, for reasons that
we can't begin to understand, a big part of an incident responder's job
seems to be opening numerous browser tabs and copy-pasting bits of text
from one system to another. The hard parts of incident response can't be
automated, but there are entire classes of busy-work that we can
eliminate with a few web hooks and some artisanal Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we're going to discuss how to use Python to automate
security incident response team (SIRT) operations. We'll give an
overview of what a typical SecOps/SIRT infrastructure looks like, how
and where automation fits in, and dive into some code. We'll walk
through a simple example, with screenshots and code, of automating a
SecOps process. We want to show that&amp;nbsp; getting started with security
automation doesn't have to be difficult or expensive (though vendors
will happily take your money). Just a little bit of Python can make some
great quality of life improvements for incident responders.&lt;/p&gt;
