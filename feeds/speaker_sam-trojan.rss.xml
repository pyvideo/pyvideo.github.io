We can probably blame the way programming is being taught. I think this should be changed and my programming teacher is a fantastic example of how to get kids excited about programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll show you some good things that he does and I'll give you some tips that will help you rock too. I think you'll leave this talk with more ideas about how to teach teenagers programming in an interesting and effective way. This will be an interactive talk with a chance to ask questions and share your experience.&lt;/p&gt;
