they should choose a messaging layer for their application - how to
evaluate their requirements against the features of the tools and make a
choice. I will use my experience with building messaging applications to
present a methodology which they can use&lt;/p&gt;

number of web applications to off load tasks that can be executed
asynchronously. This workshop will demonstrate how we can use Celery for
a use case that isn't a web site or a web application and is something
which could happen in a hospital or a bank or any other such large
organization.&lt;/p&gt;
