&lt;p&gt;Trying to find a good place to eat has become much easier and
democratic with online reviews, but on the other hand, that creates
new problems.  Can you trust that 5 star review of fast food chain as
much as the 1 star of a fancy restaurant because &amp;quot;Toast arrived far
too early, and too thin&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all like enjoy things differently.  Starting of on the assumption
that the &amp;quot;best pizza&amp;quot; is not the same for everyone.  Can we group
users into people that has similar tastes? Can we identify  reviews
and restaurants to make sense of it? Can that lead us to a better way
to find restaurants that you like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using some data handling techniques I walk you through my process and
results that I've got from that idea.  There are no requisites for
this talk except basic python and math knowledge (matrices exist)&lt;/p&gt;
