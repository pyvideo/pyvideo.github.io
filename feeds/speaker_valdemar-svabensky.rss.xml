Are you a
Python fan interested in everything Python-related? Or would you
simply like to see a non-standard presentation? If you answered yes
at least once, then this funny and inspiring talk is right for you!
In less than 20 minutes, you'll hear from a young student-teacher
about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What coding skills are taught to beginners and how&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with teaching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few surprises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No technical knowledge is needed (some code samples will be shown,
but they're not essential). Discussion at the end is welcome. Looking
forward to seeing you!&lt;/p&gt;
