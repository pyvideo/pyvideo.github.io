[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CeleraOne tries to bring its vision to Big Data by developing a unique
platform for real-time Big Data processing. The platform is capable of
personalizing multi-channel user flows, right-in time targeting and
analytics while seamlessly scaling to billions of page impression. It
is currently tailored to the needs of content providers, but of course
not limited to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The platform’s architecture is based on four main layers:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proxy/Distribution -- OpenResty/LUA for dynamic request forwarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESTful API -- several Python applications written using Pyramid web framework running under uWSGI server, which serve as an integration point for third party systems;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytics -- Python API for Big Data querying and distributed workers performing heavy data collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-memory Engine -- CeleraOne’s NoSql database which provides both data storage and fast business logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the talk I would like to give insights on how we use Python in the
architecture, which tools and technologies were chosen, and share
experiences deploying and running the system in production.&lt;/p&gt;
