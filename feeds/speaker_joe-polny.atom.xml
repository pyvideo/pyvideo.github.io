favorite IDE to start building on the blockchain! It has never been
easier for you as a Python dev to add another powerful tool to your
toolbox. Why build on blockchain? It offers permanent, transparent
record-keeping, enables traceability and provenance, and unlocks
opportunities for innovation across industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need is your laptop, a willingness to code, and the same Python
toolchain you're already familiar with. We have everything you need to
code, including Poetry, Pytest, and Docker, wrapped up in a neat
package. To get you started quickly, some basic templates are included
too! The best part? You can code using the free and open-source GitHub
Codespaces virtual IDE, so no need to install anything locally. Within
the hour you'll deploy fundamental blockchain primitives, including data
storage CRUD, getter/setter methods, logic evaluations, and role-based
access control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be the first in your team to know blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
