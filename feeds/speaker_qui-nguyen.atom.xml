time? There are many components with Python APIs that you can put
together to build a stream processing application. We will go through
some common design patterns, tradeoffs and available components /
frameworks for designing such systems. We will solve an example problem
during the presentation to make these points concrete. Much of what will
be presented is based on experience gained from building production
pipelines for the real-time processing of ad streams at Yelp. This talk
will cover topics such as consistency, availability, idempotency,
scalability, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
