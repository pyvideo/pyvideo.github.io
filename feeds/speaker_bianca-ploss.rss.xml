children have to do with writing code? More than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through stories of precision, adaptability, and resilience, I'll show
how non-technical experiences have helped me to thrive in tech. From
iteration at my forge, troubleshooting on the manufacturing floor, and
to building empathy as a parent I'll share how life's lessons have built
transferable skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a seasoned professional or a new developer, this session
will inspire you to embrace your own journey and discover the hidden
strengths you can bring to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
