&lt;p&gt;“There’s more than one way to draw a map - lessons learned after the Google Maps SDK became unaffordable” by Basil Dubyk, Alexander Gaevsky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google Maps SDK: well-known, powerful, and extremely popular - and after July 2018, suddenly unaffordable. We needed to find an alternative for Django geospatial projects. This is the story of our search and what we found, and the lessons that we’d like to share from the experience. The good news is: we returned with new knowledge from our wanderings, and were able to migrate our existing projects successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
