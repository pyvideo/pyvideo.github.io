But what happens when we transform data streams into sounds and music, and how can we do this with Python? Sound crazy? Probably, but as a musician turned Developer, I find the intersection of music and code to be fascinating. And I think others will too. This talk will go over the technologies and python libraries used to translate data streams (weather, financial data, anything) into MIDI that then is fed into synthesizers and virtual instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
