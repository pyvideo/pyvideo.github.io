how to program but any volunteer that is going to start a new teaching
group could have hundreds of questions related with concepts order,
examples, exercises, libraries and text editor/IDE. Panellists will
share their experience when teaching Python to newcomers from different
backgrounds as part of their volunteer work for some organisations such
as PyLadies, DjangoGirls, Code for Life, Software Carpentry,
Data Carpentry, etc. Among the panellists we will have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mateusz Kuzak, from the Netherlands eScience Center and volunteer for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alice Harpole, from the University of Southampton;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celine Boudier, from Code for Life;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raniere Silva (as moderator), from the Software Sustainability Institute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All questions from the audience are welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you
remember who inspired you  to become who you are when you were a
child? But also, what the challenges might have been?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was a little girl with a strong interest in a lot
of things, including science, and what and who helped me pursue an
education and a career in science and technology. However, my journey
in the industry from France to the UK, from software engineer student
to team lead, from language processing to robots to online coding
games, made me understand there is still a lot of work to be done in
terms of diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will talk about my own experiences, what shaped my dreams and
inspirations, the reality check, and the project I’m now working on
Code For Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code For Life is an initiative started at Ocado Technology in 2014,
in response to the UK putting computing in the primary school
curriculum. It comprises a small full time team and also a large
group of dedicated volunteers who focus on creating free, open source
games, mostly web games developed with Django, to teach all children
how to program. We are all dedicated to inspire all children and give
them the tools and opportunities they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
