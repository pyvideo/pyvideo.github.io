At scieneers, we wanted to test those components to satisfy our own information needs using a slack-bot that will answer our questions by reading through our internal documents and slack-conversations. We therefore leveraged the HayStack QA-Framework in combination with a Weaviate vector database and many fine-tuned NLP-models.
This talk will give you insights in both, the technical challenges we faced and the organizational learnings we took.&lt;/p&gt;
