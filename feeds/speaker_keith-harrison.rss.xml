It’s a green field project and you’ve
learned from your mistakes. You’re not going to make the same ones
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward several months and you’re in a mess. A change in one place
causes bugs in a completely different place. Adding a simple feature
means making changes all over your application. Progress is getting
slower and slower. You’re lost in complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this keep happening and what can we do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will try to answer those questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll show how complex software really is, define the different types of
complexity found in software, explain the issues complexity causes and
discuss different techniques we can use to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is suitable for anyone who has worked or will work on a
software development project. No development experience is required.&lt;/p&gt;
