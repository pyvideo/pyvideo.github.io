While other countries are looking for skilled workers, the opposite is true for Zimbabwe, which has millions of skilled workers looking for employment. Fortunately, the Internet has turned the world into a global village, yes, everyone is talking about globalization! In my talk, I intend to share on the avenues of freelancing and remote working as possible employment/business opportunity for the ordinary, unemployed person in Zimbabwe. I will share on the benefits of both to the developer as well as the nation. I will also share on how to get started as a freelancer or remote worker, with the aim of presenting new and possible employment/entrepreneurship avenues for fellow developers in Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;

But becoming a great software developer can be a long, hard and intimidating process without the right support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I want to highlight some of the best resources that I have found for learning to code and then mastering specific topics. The aim is for everyone to walk away with a better understanding of where to start and how to keep going when it comes to planning a career in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

The goal of reproducible research is to tie specific instructions to data analysis and experimental data so that scholarship can be recreated, better understood and verified. Often projects are created and kept but it is hard to replicate the results or follow the path used by a researcher. This talk will be on how to achieve reproducibility in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
