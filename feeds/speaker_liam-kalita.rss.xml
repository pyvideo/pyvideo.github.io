If you can deploy it successfully, then at the very least it runs, so we've got something to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of reasons why apps fail to deploy. They can be easy to fix, like Hardcoded secrets, fonts, or missing libraries. Or they can be intractable and super frustrating to deal with, like manifest mismatches, resource starvation, and missing libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this talk, I want you to know how to identify, investigate and proactively prevent Shiny app deployment failures from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
