As PyPI comes under threat, how can we continue to secure our beloved cheese shop through 2025?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 600k packages in PyPI power sensitive infrastructure in almost every critical industry, and it's no surprise that the Python library ecosystem is a target. In 2024 alone, the Ultralytics token compromise and the NP6 combined typosquatting and DLL sideloading attack show the sophistication of these supply chain attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of this talk (12 minutes), we'll look back at these 2024 attacks and also consider examples such as the &amp;quot;revival hijack&amp;quot; attack vector and the 2022 dependency confusion attack on PyTorch. In the second portion (12 minutes), we'll dig into some critical developments in this area that have helped to mitigate recent attacks, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provenance transparency logs using Sigstore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progressive supply chain security levels with SLSA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software Bills of Materials (sbomS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artifact scanners such as Grype and Trivy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also briefly discuss specific insights from developing Chainguard’s Guarded Ecosystems for Python, an ambitious alternative package index that rebuilds included packages from scratch. The final takeaway: while mitigations exist for these threats, they're not equally distributed, and we'll point out low hanging fruit for securing projects and infrastructure (3 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be an accessible introduction to an intermediate topic (software supply chain security). Expect some cheesy puns and memes as we deal with this muenster problem—all in excellent taste, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

As PyTorch images get deployed to production, however, security becomes a major concern. PyTorch has a large attack surface, and building secure PyTorch images can be a challenge. Currently, the official PyTorch runtime container image has 30 CVEs (known vulnerabilities) rated critical and 256 CVE rated high. Improving this situation could secure many deployments that incorporate PyTorch for cloud-based inference or training. In this fast-paced session, we'll take a deep dive on the official PyTorch image from a vulnerability mitigation perspective, looking hard at included packages, executables, and active CVE. We'll identify low-hanging fruit for increasing security, including stripping bloat and building fresh. We'll also talk about the next level of security practiced in Chainguard's PyTorch image builds, such as including SBOMs and going distroless. Finally, we'll consider emerging tools and approaches for analyzing AI artifacts such as models and how these systems can benefit PyTorch in production.&lt;/p&gt;
