How will Python help?</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycascades-2023/sboms-are-coming-how-will-python-help.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As software is increasingly integrated with many third party components, particularly open-source components, it is essential to have a clear understanding of all of the software that is being deployed. With an increasing focus on improving the Cybersecurity of the many different parts of the supply chain, there is a growing expectation that a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) will become a key artefact of any software component to help capture all of the software assets being used. This talk will briefly introduce the concept of SBOMs and show how a number of Python tools will help in the production, management and use of SBOMs as part of a system lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
