When starting a new
project or trying to improve the coverage of an existing one, there is
still a lot of debate around what frameworks should be used, what are
the best practices when mocking, when should we mock vs using in memory
and more importantly, the reasons behind each decision. This talk aims
to provide some insights on making good testing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
