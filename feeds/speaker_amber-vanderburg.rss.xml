&lt;p&gt;And when I work with these teams, I notice that there are two factors that make all the difference between a good organization and one that is changing the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is having a culture of collaboration – and this means collaboration across individuals, across departments, and across teams – really - it’s a culture that’s less about competition and cutthroat political systems.. And more about helping each other achieve the extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second quality is organizations that treat and expect their employees to act like owners. Owning not just their behaviors, actions, and responsibilities, but owning outcomes and becoming a voice for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter where your organization is at today, the good news is– there are proven strategies to create a culture of collaborative ownership at your organization and that’s what I’m going to teach you in this course.&lt;/p&gt;
