command-line interfaces, web interfaces, and configuration files. In
addition to being a very practical tool, horetu is interesting
because its implementation demonstrates the capabilities of function
objects. Finally, horetu can construct powerful interfaces and
detailed documentation from functions that were written with no
intent of being used with horetu; it is, consequently, a clear
demonstration of the merits of following conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
