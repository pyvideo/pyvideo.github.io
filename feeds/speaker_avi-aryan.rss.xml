For those who don't know, Flask RESTplus is an amazing library for REST API development with features like automatic live documentation, input payload validation, neat code organization, automatic response marshaling and a lot of extensibility. You can easily extend it to include other features like response pagination, ETag caching, rate limiting, custom authentication and authorization system and basically anything else you can imagine. In this talk, I will share my hard gained knowledge with code snippets on how to quickly get started and do all these amazing things in Flask RESTplus.&lt;/p&gt;
