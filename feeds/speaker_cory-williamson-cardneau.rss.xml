We know the
problem exists at every point in the process: education, internship
opportunities, hiring. We don't talk much about what happens to the
people we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As documentarians, we spend a lot of time thinking about the best words
to use for our products, tutorials, manuals. We know that words matter.
&amp;quot;Microaggressions&amp;quot; are the small indignities that people of color,
non-cis- gendered folks, women, and others experience on a daily basis.
Microaggressions at work tell us, over and over, that we don't really
belong in that workplace. So let's talk about the words we use with our
coworkers. Let's talk about how we can all make diversity a daily
practice at work, not just a hiring problem.&lt;/p&gt;
