Join me as I take us on an adventure to find the beasts i.e. the different ways Data Science projects can fail. I will be talking about 4 major reasons for failure (data, infrastructure, implementation, and culture), their different aspects, and supplementing it with my experiences and case studies. I will also share how to control these beasts and recommend actions to be taken to ensure a successful end-to-end Data Science project.&lt;/p&gt;

Have a dataset that
you really want to analyze but not sure how to start? This hands-on
session teaches how to explore datasets, use Machine Learning algorithms
and derive insights from models using popular Python tools like Jupyter,
pandas, sklearn and numpy. Aimed at budding data scientists with prior
programming experience in any language.&lt;/p&gt;
