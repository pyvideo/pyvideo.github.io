What does dynamic typing mean?  How about duck typing?  In this video, we'll look at what a type is in Python, as well as how to use it's most popular typechecker - mypy - to be more effective in using types.&lt;/p&gt;

You can, and mypy can help! Learn how static type checking and functional patterns can help you write less coupled, more transparent and safer code, without an ORM.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will discuss some of the challenges that we encountered, how we dealt with them, what we learnt, and whether we thought it was worth all the effort. (Spoiler: we did think it was worth all the effort.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't have time to give a full overview of MyPy, but I will try to cover enough basics that the talk is mostly accessible to people who aren't already familiar with it.&lt;/p&gt;

On small code bases this property is helpful and might increase productivity. On medium to large code bases this might be an impediment. In this session I will introduce mypy, which introduces type hints into Python in attempt to solve that impediment.&lt;/p&gt;
