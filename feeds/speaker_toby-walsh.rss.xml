He was named by the Australian newspaper as a &amp;quot;rock star&amp;quot; of the digital revolution, and included in the inaugural Knowledge Nation 100, the list of the 100 most important digital innovators in Australia. Professor Walsh's research focuses on how computers can interact with humans to optimise decision-making for the common good. He is also a passionate advocate for limits to ensure AI is used to improve, not hurt, our lives. In 2015, Professor Walsh was behind an open letter calling for a ban on autonomous weapons or 'killer robots' that was signed by more than 20,000 AI researchers and high profile scientists, entrepreneurs and intellectuals, including Stephen Hawking, Noam Chomsky, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and Tesla founder Elon Musk. He was subsequently invited by Human Rights Watch to talk at the United Nations in both New York and Geneva. Professor Walsh is a Fellow of the Australia Academy of Science, and winner of the Humboldt Award. His book, &amp;quot;Machines that Think: The Past, Present and Future of AI&amp;quot; will be published in early 2017 by Black Inc. His twitter account, &amp;#64;TobyWalsh was voted one of the top ten to keep abreast of developments in AI. His blog, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://thefutureofai.blogspot.com"&gt;https://thefutureofai.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt; attracts tens of thousands of readers every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Fears About AI Are Wrong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you be worried about progress in Artificial Intelligence? Will Artificial Intelligence destroy jobs? Should we fear killer robots? Does Artificial Intelligence threaten our very existence?  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is in the zeitgeist. Billions of dollars are being poured into the field, and spectacular advances are being announced regularly. Not surprisingly, many people are starting to worry where this will all end. The Chief Economist of the Bank of England predicted that Artificial Intelligence will destroy 50% of existing jobs. Thousands of Artificial Intelligence researchers signed an Open Letter predicting that Artificial Intelligence could transform warfare and lead to an arms race of &amp;quot;killer robots&amp;quot;. And Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and others have predicted that Artificial Intelligence could end humanity itself. What should you make of all these predictions? Should you worry? Are you worrying about the right things? And what should we do now to ensure a safe and prosperous future for all?&lt;/p&gt;
