conversational language models and sentiment analysis models to make an
interactive chatbot. The models that we will use are Blenderbot from
Facebook Research and distilbert from google research / huggingface. We
will also use Transformers from Huggingface which is an easy to use
packaging and API for the above systems and also go over using speech
recognition and text to speech to make interaction more fluid. At the
end there will be an interactive demo.&lt;/p&gt;
