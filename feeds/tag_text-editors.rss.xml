in last several years has become a tool of choice for more and more
Python developers. But not everybody uses its full power. Moreover, most

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that an IDE is not just about a set of integrated tools,
but an environment that understands the semantics of your project, of
what youâ€™re doing. It can leverage this to provide you with
functionality that can make repetitive mundane tasks become
frictionless, as well as give insight into potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will go through 42 the most powerful features the
IDE offers and whether you do web development or work with data using
Python, you will benefit knowing how the IDE can leverage your
programming skills.&lt;/p&gt;
