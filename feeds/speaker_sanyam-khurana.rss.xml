project and suddenly these requirements come in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to have a local support for the Chinese language!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case, you’ve not written your application with localization and
internationalization in mind, then “Boy! You’re in danger! You should
better start praying to almighty to give you strength and endurance to
support yet another language in your app”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll see how do we support localization and serve our app
in different languages, based on what language the client wants to
communicate in. As a backend, we should be language agnostic and allow
all clients to communicate with us in one of the languages we support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how to support translation for static data (using makemessages
/ compilemessages) and dynamic data, using various third-party services
such as django-translations and transifex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, static data is translations for all the fields, error messages
etc. that the app already has and dynamic data is the custom data input
by the user in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would enable you to have your admin panel, as well as RESTful APIs,
served in different languages.&lt;/p&gt;

At first, it looks like all the methods and attributes will be inherited by the child class. While it works for the majority of scenarios, as soon as we hit multiple-inheritance, deciding what method/attribute will take precedence, becomes a  daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also known as the diamond problem. While some languages use an algorithm such as right-first-depth-first search to solve this, Python 2 used Depth-first from Left to Right (DLR) and Python3 uses C3 Linearization Algorithm. Getting hold of this information will help you not succumbing to the common pitfalls with the arrangement of name lookups in a class hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRO (Method Resolution Order) defines the class search path for linearizing the class ancestor tree. We’ll also have a look at how C3 algorithm is monotonic as it guarantees that base class declaration is preserved and subclasses appear before base classes. We’ll further explore MRO using &lt;cite&gt;__bases__&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;__base__&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;__mro__&lt;/cite&gt; magic methods.&lt;/p&gt;
