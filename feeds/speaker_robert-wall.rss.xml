We track millions of individual timeseries, with divergent formats,
from disparate time zones, and whose frequencies vary from months
to milliseconds. We go beyond simply reading and storing it -
we stitch distinct and vast data sets together and subject them to
intricate calculations in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on the way we use Python to achieve these ends,
and how we are creating tools to further commoditise streaming as a service.&lt;/p&gt;
