years ago with a gnarly bug and some bad assumptions. A few long nights
and a lot of reading later, the docs corrected my assumption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The
truth of x==y does not imply that x!=y is false. Mind == blown and mind
!= blown. In Getting Rich with Comparison Methods we'll start by
learning how to avoid common and costly bugs in your rich comparison
methods, learn a bit about which methods are executed in comparisons and
why, and then go beyond symmetrical comparisons exploring some of the
ways we can take full advantage of asymmetrical comparison methods.&lt;/p&gt;
