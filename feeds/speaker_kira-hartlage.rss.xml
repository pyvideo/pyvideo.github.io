Explore basic
embedded hardware concepts with me as we use CircuitPython and a
PyRuler. CircuitPython is a programming language that simplifies writing
code for microcontrollers. The PyRuler is an engineering reference for
sizes of various electronic components, but it's also a microcontroller
board complete with LEDs, capactive touch buttons, and various inputs
and outputs that let you get started designing your embedded system with
little to no hardware experience.&lt;/p&gt;
