How to implement a question answering system,
based on a TV series wiki - PyCon Italia 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you always dreamed of providing knowledge to a computer so that it
can answer your questions? It is finally possible and easy to do this,
using python and the Haystack library. I’ll explain how to quickly
implement a Question Answering system, starting from docs about your
favorite TV series. Web app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you always dreamed of providing knowledge to a computer so that it
can answer your questions? In this talk, I’m going to present the open
source Haystack library: an end-to-end python framework that enables you
to build powerful and production-ready pipelines for different search
use cases, shuch as Question Answering and semantic document search.
Haystack is modular, so that you can combine the best technology from
Transformers, Elasticsearch, or Milvus. I present a simple and funny use
case, where I quickly and easyly build a Question Answering system,
starting from a collection of documents about Twin Peaks TV series. I
also provide some theoretical details to make everyone understand how
this technology works and I briefly talk about the trade-offs between
response quality, response speed and computational effort.&lt;/p&gt;
