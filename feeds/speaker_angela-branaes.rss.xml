daunting at first. Having made many variations of these,
I will show you the ropes, so you too can discover that it is in fact
easy to get going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk you will learn to create a full-stack web application in
Python, with a Nodejs and React front-end.
I will provide you with an easy-to- follow walkthrough of the process,
and youâ€™ll exit this talk feeling confident that you can now create
your own full-stack web application.&lt;/p&gt;
