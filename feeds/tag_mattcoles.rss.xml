It was designed for this single purpose and had never been considered to be needed or expanded beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the next six months, the app was adapted to allow breakfasts, hoodies, socks, pens and rubik's cubes ordered for different events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these new adaptions came added complexities.&lt;/p&gt;
