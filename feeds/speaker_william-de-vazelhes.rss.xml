&lt;p&gt;Metric learning is an area of machine learning which aims to learn a
distance (or similarity) measure between samples for a given task. In
this presentation, I will start by briefly introducing the main ideas of
metric learning and some of its applications, and show a concrete
example of using metric-learn, the metric learning library in Python. I
will then highlight the importance of making a machine learning package
compatible with scikit-learn and discuss the challenges in the specific
case of metric-learn, in particular regarding API constraints. Finally,
we will dig into metric-learn's code to illustrate the main design
choices, and emphasize some general issues (such as test design) that
require special care when developing a machine learning toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
