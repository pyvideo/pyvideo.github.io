&lt;p&gt;In recent years, we have seen many improvements in Python Garbage Collection but there are some instances when it doesn’t work as expected. This results in memory crunch for the application leading it to crash. Although there are multiple ways to overcome the memory challenges, sometimes it is difficult to find what we can improve in our code and infrastructure that can make them memory efficient. In such cases, it helps to have an understanding of what is going on behind the curtains at a low level where memory is being managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation aims to give a quick overview of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How CPython manages the Memory allocation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common memory errors we see in day to day production code and how we can improve them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will share what we have learned so far and encourage you to try it with your own projects. We'll walk through a simple example, with screenshots and code wherever required.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
