give an example of such an API and I will take you through the
implementation details and the usage of flask, dougrain and HAL in this
context. Also, I will present a brief comparison with an API that is not
hypermedia enabled and take you through the advantages of using the
hypermedia approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the technology community at the moment there is a lot of talk about
hypermedia enabled APIs and Web as an Architecture model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more applications nowadays try to adopt the loosely coupled and
distributed web like architecture by using hypermedia as an engine of
the application state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Sky we are successfully implementing this approach for some of our
components, and weâ€™ve learnt that the major benefit for us is the
scalability that it offers: as an increasingly expanding business with a
constantly growing product portfolio, scalability of all our systems is
crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will share some of the things we learnt, I will explain
what hypermedia enabled API means, I will give an example of such an API
and I will take you through the implementation details and the usage of
flask, dougrain and HAL in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I will present a brief comparison with an API that is not
hypermedia enabled and take you through the advantages of using the
hypermedia approach.&lt;/p&gt;
