flood of incoming issues/tikets on their project. We've scraped more
than 10000 GitHub projects and interviewed more than 100 software
developers and project managers of companies like GitLab. As a result,
we have identified a few simple steps that can help managing the load of
issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk sums up the steps and approaches needed to deal with this as
well as automate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a full summary, check out &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://about.gitlab.com/2017/10/26/triage-issues-gitmate/"&gt;our blog post with
GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="who-and-why"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Who and Why&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The talk is for project managers and open source maintainers or
software developers that deal with issues every day. This includes
specifically people working in teams with more than 30 issues a
month opened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's no background knowledge needed. The talk will be best for
people who have triaged issues before at least in a small scale and
recognize the problem, they will be able to pick up the approaches
better and faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On an emotional level, I expect the audience to get to know the
&amp;quot;attitude&amp;quot; needed to get rid of noise when triaging issues. After
the talk, they should have a few concrete steps in mind that they
can try using in the first days and eventually deduct their own
process from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the story you will learn how to use code analysis but also about growing an open source project and building businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coala started out as a fun project. Eventually we noticed that people would find it useful. This talk tells the story of how it began, what we did and what we can learn from it. It builds upon the previous talks 'Growing an Open Source Community', 'Open Source Contribtor Automation' and 'coala - Code Analysis for .*' which have received very positive comments by listeners and gives a top level overview over what happened while still being educational in areas touching lifestyle, open source aspects, technical concepts as well as sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

We never believed
there would be anything useful growing out of it - and yet it did.
Contributors all over the world came to us and helped creating the
community as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how did all of this happen? What does this mean for the main
contributors? How can we make a living of an open source project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk tells our story. What we did - good and bad things - so we
can learn from it. From my personal open source contributions over
founding an open source project to building a freelance agency and
founding a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants will learn how they can grow an open source project,
automate newcomer processes and gain insights into how they can start
making a living of it, possibly founding a company eventually. There
is no single recipe for this but we can - and should - exchange the
tips and tricks we’ve gained with our ventures. This talk is for
entrepreneurs, wanna-be-freelancers and future or past open source
project founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is completely new and has not been presented at any
conference yet although it overlaps with previous talks of mine which
have received much positive feedback at previous regional PyCons. It
will be tested at a local meetup to ensure proper timing.&lt;/p&gt;

At the PyCon Munich I presented 10 actionable steps to grow a community, based on what we did to grow coala from ~5 contributors to over 300 people having submitted a patch successfully without lowering our quality bar. The feedback on this talk has been overwhelming and it's time to launch the next iteration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Open Source Contributor Automation&amp;quot; will give you a short overview over the strategies to grow an open source project like a startup. We will then learn about tools and strategies to save maintainers from burning out on newcomers: you will learn about our open source tooling and how to use it on your organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Abstract&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;coala is an Open Source project with well over 400 contributors and more
than 50 Google Summer of Code applications this year. What’s behind it?
How did it all start? What is the secret sauce to its growth and how do
we make a living of it? This talk tells our story with the key takeaways
and provides a top level story driven insight on those and more topics.
This talk is perfect for people who want to live and work for their own
ideas rather than being a gear in a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="description"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Description&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;coala began as a fun project. We never believed there would be anything
useful growing out of it - and yet it did. Contributors all over the
world came to us and helped creating the community as it is. Eventually
I became a freelancer and got funding for working on a startup based on
coala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did all of this happen? What does this mean for the main
contributors? How can we make a living of an open source project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk tells our story. What we did - good and bad things - so we all
can learn from it. From my personal open source contributions over
founding an open source project to building a freelance agency and
founding a startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants will learn how they can grow an open project, automate
newcomer processes and gain insights into how they can start making a
living of it, possibly founding a company eventually. There is no single
recipe for this but we can - and should - exchange the tips and tricks
we’ve gained with our ventures. This talk is for entrepreneurs,
wanna-be-freelancers and future or open source project founders and
contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
