at the University of Chicago, will describe the Python library they are
developing to deduplicate tabular data, quickly, accurately, and at a
large scale. The library facilitates the matching of related records in
different data sets, using a machine learning approach. They expect to
have a demo to show and will explain how they expect that the library
will be used.&lt;/p&gt;
