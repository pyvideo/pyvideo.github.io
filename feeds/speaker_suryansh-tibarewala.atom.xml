We all follow agile product development
process, iterate fast, fail fast and in the disguise of a MVP we cut
corners to release a product to the market ASAP. In this process, their
are several compromises we make in the tech set up and the codebase to
just get it out there. These compromises more often than not always
bites us back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what the talk is about. The assumptions which never hold,
the implementation which is never revisited, and the MVP which never
ends up being just a MVP. By the end of talk, you would know the
cautionary tale of the most common mistakes everyone makes while
developing a new product and some measures on how you can avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
