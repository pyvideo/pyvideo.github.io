ways to present that content to readers on a vast array of devices and
hardware has been even more problematic. This session will explore best
practices for enabling your content to automatically adapt to various
computers, browsers, devices, and platforms. This is a rapidly changing
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation Mike will cover the most recent developments in the
industry that have made responsive content presentation much easier for
content authors. Mike will visit the concept of Media Queries and
compare that with the newer and easier techniques such as using the
FlexBox Model. It has never been easier to ensure that your content is
presented to your reader in an optimized manner.&lt;/p&gt;
