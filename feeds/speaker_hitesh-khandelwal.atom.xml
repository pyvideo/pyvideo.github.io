&lt;p&gt;1 in 8 people in the US alone suffers from muteness today. Statistics
related to the number of cases of Autism and other speaking disorder is
quite disappointing too. In recent years, researchers and scientists
have successfully used deep learning to read brain signals and translate
them into human-readable language like English. Hence, Deep learning has
given us all the hope to provide voiceless the voice.&lt;/p&gt;
