containing over 20 experimental stations or beamlines, many of which are
capable of generating Terra-bytes of raw data every day. In this data
rich environment, many scientists that come to the facility can be
daunted by the sheer quantity and complexity of the data on offer. The
scientific software group is charged with assisting with this deluge of
data and as a small team it is imperative that provides sustainable and
rapid solutions to problems. Python has proved to be well suited to this
and is now used heavily at the facility, from cutting edge research
projects, through general pipe-lining and data management, to simple
data manipulation scripts. And by a range of staff and facility users,
from experienced software engineers and scientists, to support staff and
PhD students simply wanting something to help make sense of the data or
experimental set-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation focuses on the current state of the scientific
management and data analysis within Diamond, and details the workhorses
which are relied on, as well as what the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;
