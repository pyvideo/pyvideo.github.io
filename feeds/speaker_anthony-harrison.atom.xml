With an increasing focus on improving the Cybersecurity of the many different parts of the supply chain, there is a growing expectation that a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) will become a key artefact of any software component to help capture all of the software assets being used. This talk will briefly introduce the concept of SBOMs and show how a number of Python tools will help in the production, management and use of SBOMs as part of a system lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
