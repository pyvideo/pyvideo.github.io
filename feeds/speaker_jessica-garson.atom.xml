It provides standardized APIs, libraries, and tools to collect telemetry data such as metrics, logs, and traces. OTel is open source and vendor neutral, designed to work with any backend system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present several examples demonstrating why logs alone may be insufficient, along with the benefits of incorporating extra signals. These benefits include enhanced visibility into the execution flow and call timing, metrics on how users utilize services to pinpoint unnecessary ones, and the ability to detect patterns, such as peak usage times, which aids in production planning and scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

alternate side of the street parking regulations. This means most nights I
need to move my car before the early morning street cleaning that happens in
my neighborhood. I had developed a nightly routine around moving my car
before I go to bed. I am sometimes a bit too good at this and I often move
my car on days I don’t need to. Since alternate side of the street parking
is often canceled on days where there are holidays, or bad weather, there is
a Twitter handle &amp;#64;NYCASP, which posts daily and whenever there is an
emergency situation. I used Python, Twilio and the Twitter API to solve this
problem for myself so I get a text message whenever I don't need to move my car.&lt;/p&gt;
