&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaping the benefits of functional programming can be a real challenge,
falling anywhere between exciting and frustrating, to the point that one
might end up feeling demotivated and embarrassed about writing in the
functional style in the “real world”. I have always strived to write
functional side- effect free code for production, and this year I have
been taking functional programming for myself one step further by
re-writing some of my Python tools in Haskell, and I would like to share
my findings. In this tutorial we will work through a progression of
increasing in complexity fun-to-solve problems, obtain solutions both in
Python and Haskell, in order to be able to first hand compare and
contrast readability, performance and development time. Bring a laptop
and a couple of interpreters (ipython and ghci) and lets do some
hacking!&lt;/p&gt;
