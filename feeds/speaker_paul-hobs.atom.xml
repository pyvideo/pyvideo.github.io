However, generating a curvilinear-orthogonal grid can be a challenging task in and of itself. Perhaps equally challenging can be locating and compiling from source code the C-libraries to do so. By collaborating with academic and open source communities, Geosyntec Consultants was able to help bridge the availability and usability gaps for the tools needs to generate, manipulate, and visualize results on model grids. In this talk, I discuss how we collaborated with these communities to successfully build these tools, share them back with the communities, and provide a brief demo of their use.&lt;/p&gt;
