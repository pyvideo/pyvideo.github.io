It uses and
inter-operates with several key scientific python packages: numpy,
pyfits, and scipy.&lt;/p&gt;

Observatory of Japan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ginga is a new astronomical image viewer written in python. It uses and
inter-operates with several key scientific python packages: numpy,
pyfits, and scipy. A key differentiator for this image viewer, compared
to older-generation FITS viewers, is that all the key components are
written as python classes, allowing for the first time a powerful FITS
image display widget to be directly embedded in, and tightly coupled
with, python code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call Ginga a toolkit for programming FITS viewers because it includes
a choice of base classes for programming custom viewers for two
different modern widget sets: Gtk and Qt, available on the three common
desktop platforms. In addition, a reference viewer is included with the
source code based on a plugin architecture in which the viewer can be
extended with plugins scripted in python. The code is released under a
BSD license similar to other major python packages and is available on
github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ginga has been introduced only recently as a tool to the astronomical
community, but since SciPy has a developer focus this talk concentrates
on programming with the Ginga toolkit. We cover two cases: using the
bare image widget to build custom viewers and writing plugins for the
existing full-featured Ginga viewer. The talk may be of interest to
anyone developing code in python needing to display scientific image
(CCD or CMOS) data and astronomers interested in python-based quick look
and analysis tools.&lt;/p&gt;

astronomical image viewer and toolkit written in python and hosted on
Github. The package was introduced to the scientific python community at
SciPy 2013 and has received a number of enhancements since then based on
user feedback. The talk includes an image mosaicing demo of a wide-field
camera exposure with 116 4Kx2K CCDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginga is an open-source astronomical image viewer and toolkit written in
python and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga"&gt;hosted on Github&lt;/a&gt;. It
uses and inter-operates with several key scientific python packages:
numpy, scipy, astropy and matplotlib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk/poster we describe and illustrate recent enhancements to
the package since the introductory talk at SciPy 2013, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;modular/pluggable interfaces for world coordinate systems, image file
I/O and star and image catalogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support for rendering into matplotlib figures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support for image mosaicing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support for image overlays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;customizable user-interface bindings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self contained Mac OS X packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk we will demonstrate the mosaicing plugin that is being
used with several instruments at Subaru Telescope in Hawaii, including
the new Hyper Suprime-Cam wide-field camera with 116 separate 4Kx2K
CCDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk/poster may be of interest to anyone developing code in python
needing to display scientific image (CCD or CMOS) data and astronomers
interested in python-based quick look and analysis tools.&lt;/p&gt;
