and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems? This is one of the most
frequently asked question about my work. The short answer: a mix of
Scala, Python and F# The long answer: DSLs are a hot topic and play a
crucial role in many of the tasks Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems need to tackle. Expertise in DSLs is mission
critical in ML and AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
