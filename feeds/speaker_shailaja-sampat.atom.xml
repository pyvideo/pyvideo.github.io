&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, building predictive models required specialized coding
abilities and a deep understanding of statistical concepts. However,
AutoML simplifies this process and can automatically create machine
learning models from your data. This session will empower you to use a
simple, open-source AutoML tool to quickly create Python-based machine
learning prototypes (using the pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn
frameworks) without writing any code. A live demonstration will show how
AutoML seamlessly (i) processes input data, (ii) selects and trains the
best algorithms for your specific use case, (iii) generates reproducible
Python code for easy integration, and most importantly, (iv) how to
interpret the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discover how AutoML can turn your transform your data into actionable
insights!&lt;/p&gt;
