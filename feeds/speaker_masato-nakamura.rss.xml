Thanks to this, static type
analysis is now available in Pythonâ€™s world. It is possible to use this
mechanism with mypy, intellij etc. In this session we will learn about
type hinting in Python 3.5 / 3.6/ 3.7. Next, learn how to use static
type analysis using mypy. It is also possible to use mypy not only in
Python 3 but also in Python 2. In other words, it is said to demonstrate
great power to port Python 2 code to Python 3. In fact there are already
successes like the following projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this session, I am pleased that you can think about writing
python code and writing tests.&lt;/p&gt;
