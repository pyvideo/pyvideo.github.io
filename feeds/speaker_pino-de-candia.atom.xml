integrated with OpenStack, Eucalyptus and Docker. We open sourced in
November last year and we’re working hard to build a strong community
around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will cover MidoNet's core concepts, what distinguishes
it from other SDN solutions, its core design and why you would choose it
for your project/business. Or not. I'll also discuss some of the cool
features that we're currently working on, especially around Multi-site
Federation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be introduced to concepts like Topology Aware Switches and JIT
Datapath flow computation as well as our distributed agent model. You’ll
learn why we strongly believe in having intelligent switches and how
this impacts the overlay topology definition as well as the Network
Function Virtualization implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we hope you'll head over to midonet.org and take it
for a spin.&lt;/p&gt;
