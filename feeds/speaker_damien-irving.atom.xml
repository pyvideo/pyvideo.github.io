however they are almost always self-taught. They spend a large
percentage of their time wrestling with software, reinvent a lot of
wheels, and still don’t know if their results are reliable. For
proficient software developers, particularly those employed to assist
these scientists, this computational illiteracy is easy to identify, but
much harder to remedy. What do you teach a scientist, given their time
constraints, background knowledge and work requirements? This
presentation will give an answer to that question, by describing what
gets taught at a Software Carpentry boot camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software Carpentry is a volunteer organisation that has been teaching
basic software development to scientists for over a decade. Supported by
the Sloan Foundation and Mozilla, Software Carpentry has refined its
teaching methods over time and has recently settled on a model centred
around the delivery of intensive short courses known as “boot camps”.
Institutions such as Oxford University, MIT, University of California
Berkeley and the International Centre for Theoretical Physics have all
hosted boot camps in the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Greg Wilson, the founder of Software Carpentry, flew out to
Australia in February 2013 to host a series of two day boot camps with
the Genes to Geoscience Research Centre in Sydney and the Australian
Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (AMOS) and ARC Centre for
Excellence in Climate System Science in Melbourne. These two events were
the first ever boot camps held outside of North America and Europe, were
booked out in a matter of days, and received rave reviews from
participants. Given this success, there are already plans afoot to host
a pair of boot camps for the bioinformatics community in Brisbane and
Adelaide later this year, plus another for the weather/climate community
in Hobart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will describe what gets taught at a Software Carpentry
boot camp (hint: there's lots of Python), how it's taught and why it's
so effective (hint: we take an evidence-based approach to teaching). All
Software Carpentry teaching materials can be freely re-used under open
access licenses, so at the conclusion of the talk you can take anything
you've learned and apply it to your own work and/or teaching. Better
still, you'll find out how to join the Australian Software Carpentry
team, so that you can organise and/or teach a boot camp for your own
discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

software skills to researchers in science, engineering and medicine.
Supported by the Mozilla Science Lab, it runs two-day bootcamps all over
the world, provides open access material for self-paced instruction, and
runs a training program for aspiring instructors. The core two-day
curriculum includes the Unix shell (and how to automate repetitive
tasks); Python or R (and how to grow a program in a modular, testable
way); Git and GitHub (and how to track and share work efficiently); and
SQL (and the difference between structured and unstructured data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the organisation has been around for over a decade, it had a
breakout year in 2013. The number of qualified instructors swelled to
over 100 and collectively they ran over 100 events for over 4300
researchers in a dozen countries. To kick things off in Australia, the
founder of Software Carpentry (Dr. Greg Wilson) visited Sydney and
Melbourne in February 2013 to host the first ever bootcamps outside of
Europe and North America. Since that visit five local instructors have
been trained up and have delivered an additional ten bootcamps around
the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will review the first year of Software Carpentry
activities in Australia, with a particular focus on the key lessons
learned in teaching computational best practices to the research
community. Future plans and directions will also be outlined, including
an overview of an innovative new project called the Research Bazaar.
Coordinated out of The University of Melbourne, this project has started
offering regular bootcamps to researchers in the Melbourne area and
looks set to inspire widespread institutional support for bootcamp
delivery. The Software Carpentry teaching materials are also undergoing
rapid development, with work on an advanced curriculum and new lessons
on “data carpentry” already underway. There are very few examples of
open, collaborative lesson development in the education sector, so the
application of routine software development practices in this space
(e.g. version control, pull requests, and the progressive release of new
versions) is somewhat ground breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
