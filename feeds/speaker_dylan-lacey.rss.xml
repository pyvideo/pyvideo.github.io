But what about testing your web
applications, javascript and all? Selenium is good but can be verbose
and clunky. Kill off test bloat and make your tests elegant and deadly,
with Splinter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splinter is a DSL for writing web app integration tests. It wraps
Selenium Webdriver or Zope Testdriver, supports Javascript and AJAX,
supports css and xpath selectors and provides a clean, easily read API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll look at installing, configuring and using Splinter.
We'll cover common tasks, selectors and executing javascript. Suitable
for those new to selenium and those who are frustrated by it, this talk
aims to get you interested and remove one of the excuses for not testing
more.&lt;/p&gt;
