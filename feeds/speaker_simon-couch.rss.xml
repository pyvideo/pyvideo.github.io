After a year of research and design, the tidymodels team is excited to share a set of tools to help data scientists develop fair machine learning models and communicate about them effectively. This talk will introduce the research field of machine learning fairness and demonstrate a fairness-oriented analysis of a machine learning model with tidymodels.&lt;/p&gt;
