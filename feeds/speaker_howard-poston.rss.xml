Incidents like Zerologon demonstrate how easy it is for a simple tweak to a cryptographic algorithm to break everything. Itâ€™s difficult to know what will break a cryptographic algorithm, and the modern algorithms we rely on today are considered secure because a lot of people have tried to break them and no one has succeeded yet. That said, there are some fundamental and common mistakes that undermine the security of cryptographic algorithms. This session discusses some of the main ways in which cryptography can go wrong, what happens when these errors occur, and best practices for mitigating the risks of bad cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#PWC2022 attracted nearly 375 attendees from 36 countries and 21 time zones making it the biggest and best year yet. The highly engaging format featured 90 speakers, 6 tracks (including 80 talks and 4 tutorials) and took place virtually on March 21-25, 2022 on LoudSwarm by Six Feet Up.&lt;/p&gt;
