The talk includes a brief (seriously, BRIEF) overview of Python packaging, followed by specific examples of issues which can result from larger packages. After discussing specific examples of (in the speaker's opinion) unnecessary files found in some popular Python packages, the talk concludes with strategies for reducing package size and a description of how to estimate the impact of changes on package size. If you're known as &amp;quot;the pedantic one&amp;quot; on your team, this talk is for you!&lt;/p&gt;
