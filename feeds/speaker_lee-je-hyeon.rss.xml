For these people, Matplotlib, a data visualization library, is an essential program that they must learn along with numpy and pandas. However, in the rush to learn many functions, they often skip over the object-oriented method that can effectively visualize data. In this presentation, we will experience the object-oriented method and learn how to widely use the Matplotlib ecosystem through the process of creating a picture close to the best data visualization example.&lt;/p&gt;
