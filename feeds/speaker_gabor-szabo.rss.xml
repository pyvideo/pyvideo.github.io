In this session we'll learn how to write tests using pytest. We will start by introducing pytest and we will see how to use it to write unittest for brand new code. TDD style. Then we'll take a look at the case where you already have a lot of code without tests and consider how can we approach that problem. We'll see how to write integration tests and how to mock the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

Your first task is simple. Make a little tweak to an existing application. To your horror you discover the code is a mess written in the past 10 years by many different people who have just started their career as Python programmers. They all have already move on. They left behind the code, but it has no tests and no documentation. Oh and by the way, the company depends on the application. What do you do now? Fight or flight? In this talk you will hear about a couple of ways to fight with such a beast.&lt;/p&gt;
