using gluon and MXNet’s new NumPy-compatible functions, a port of the
classic NumPy with GPU accelerations and additional features for deep
learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the code snippets shown during the talk are available at

&lt;p&gt;Diving into deep learning requires understanding bulky new frameworks,
which significantly increases the adoption curve for data scientists in
industry. In this talk, we’ll cover creation of a multilayer perceptron
model using gluon and MXNet’s new NumPy-compatible functions, a port of
the classic NumPy with GPU accelerations and additional features for
deep learning. These open source tools will give you a working
foundation for building out more complicated models for real
applications with faster performance and less hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

The session will introduce the key features of NP on MXNet and give a demo how to build a machine learning model with this new package.&lt;/p&gt;
