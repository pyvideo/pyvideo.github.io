&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, confusion around which restrictions are imposed on base class by Django when using proxy models will be brought to rest during this talk. The possibilities of proxy models inheriting  multiple abstract models will be covered in this talk. Proxy mode manipulation of the Model manager and when to manipulate the Manager will also be part of the talk’s package. Being fairly similar to unmanaged models, the talk will highlight the most common differences  and when to use each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading through the Django proxy model, or even reading through the first paragraph above makes one say “cool stuff !!!” and then the next thing you forget about it. This is because finding the practical application of proxy models in real world scenarios is difficult. This talk will showcase practical aspects of using proxy model through the use on an abstract base class, equipping developers mind with an image or the possibilities of this proxy model.&lt;/p&gt;

organization and Python developers in the Harare software development
community to advance the cause of women in technology in Zimbabwe. The
program operates in community centers, universities, high schools and
tech hubs to make programming accessible to girls regardless of their
socio-economic status. Upon initially joining a ZimboPy club, many of
the girls would have never used a computer before, let alone code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zimbabwe, only 17% of computer science undergraduate majors are
women, and in the developing world, women make up less than 20% of the
information and technology workforce. ZimboPy exists to empower
Zimbabwean girls with the skills and confidence necessary to not only
enter the local tech industry, but to lead it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to learning to code, ZimboPy club members also join a global
network of women in technology that are working to tackle social
challenges through human-centered design and computer science.The Python
community has been a central part of our work. For our mentorship week
that was held in April we had python programmers from USA, Italy,
Australia and of course Zimbabwe join us in person and virtually. Our
talk will outline what we've achieved so far and how anyone who's part
of the Python community can get involved. We invite developers from
around the world to help Zimbabwean girls address local problems which
can be solved with technology, such as clean water and e-commerce
solutions for small shops in towns and villages. Mentors can travel to
Zimbabwe and work with girls as they develop a plan for their
applications and pair-program with them, answering questions and
providing feedback along the way. Overall, ZimboPy looks forward to
changing Zimbabwe's future through creativity, collaboration and the
power of Python programming&lt;/p&gt;
