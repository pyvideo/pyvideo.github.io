&lt;p&gt;Now imagine these outcomes:
•       Students wanting to continue coding from the lessons outside of class in their own time
•       Students asking to replicate the lesson computing environment at home
•       Students disappointed for the lessons to come to an end and asking for more
•       Students struggling in Science discovering intrinsic ability in computing, bringing new enjoyment and confidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, imagine that all the students are girls!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will share this actual case study of a pioneering Python education initiative implemented at a secondary school for girls in London, UK for a cohort of 120 students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience will gain actionable insights of the factors that enabled these children to develop basic but working proficiency of a mainstream scientific data stack using typical school IT resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this talk aims to increase awareness of Scientific Computing &amp;amp; Data Science as potentially effective and empowering Python education for young people.&lt;/p&gt;
