daily lives by getting embedded into billions of smart objects and IoT
devices. Securing such devices presents a number of unique challenges,
since they are deployed in uncontrolled, complex, and often hostile
environments. Smart devices currently apply Machine Learning techniques
to detect and mitigate security issues as they occur. The
ever-increasing number of new security challenges however, requires them
to predict and proactively protect against potential threats that may
occur in the future by utilising Deep Learning techniques. In this talk,
we will discuss the security challenges facing the IoT networks, as well
as desires and requirements for making the journey from Machine Learning
to Deep Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
