Distributed checkpoint support saving and loading from multiple ranks in parallel. It handles load-time resharding which enables saving in one cluster topolgy and loading to another. It also supports saving in one parallelism and loading into another. It is currently adopted by IBM, Mosaic, and XLA for FSDP checkpoint, and it is also being used for Shampoo OSS release checkpointing support. We will talk about distributed checkpoint support today and what is coming up next.&lt;/p&gt;

We will first introduce Compiled Autograd, a torch.compile mode to fully capture the backpropagation step, including the communication collective operators used in distributed. We will then cover the improvements this new approach brought to Compiled DDP/FSDP, notably by removing DDP/FSDP graph breaks which brings the potential of improving compute/communication overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
