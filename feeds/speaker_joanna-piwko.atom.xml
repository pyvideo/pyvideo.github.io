Artificial Intelligence. The talk's goal is to present how to make
detect five emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust) for
tweets in Polish language using open source tools. During the
presentation, the process from data collecting to creating a deep neural
network will be shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentiment analysis is one of the problems which can be solved using
Artificial Intelligence. Most research related to the analysis of
emotions in Polish texts from social media, (especially from Twitter)
focus only on classification as positive, negative or neutral. In my
pitch, I would like to concentrate on detecting 5 emotions like
happiness, sadness, anger, disgust and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the presentation I will show how the whole process from data
collecting, preprocessing and labelling to training model and presenting
results looks like. The implementation was done using Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, text data from Twitter was cleaned from links, emojis and unknown
symbols, which are unnecessary for the analysis. For input to the model,
texts were converted to numeric representation in vectors. This
representation was generated using pretrained Word2vec model for the
Polish language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For labelling data, words were transformed to lemmas (dictionary form)
using Morfeusz 2 package, which is an inflectional analyser. This
operation was necessary to generate vectors of the numeric
representation of emotions. For every word a vector with the numeric
representation of 5 emotions using Necki Affective Word List was
created. This list contains numeric information of emotions about words
in lemma grammar form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model used for the sentiment analysis was LSTM network. The first
layer of the model was the embedding layer which takes weights for every
word from Word2vec model. Then were LSTM and dense layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of presentation, I will show the results with examples of
good classification and misclassification.&lt;/p&gt;
