But what if I don’t
just want any job that pays the bills, but the job that will push my
career and that I actually enjoy doing every day? If your answer to why
you’d like to join company XY is: “Work from home and make good money”,
you should not be surprised to not be taken into the next round. But
what would be a good answer to that question? What should I say when
asked where I see myself in 5 years? There are a lot of subtle aspects
to succeeding and failing in the application process, from your initial
cover letter to the on site visit meeting the team. As a tech recruiter,
I’d like to share with you the best and (sometimes quite entertaining)
worst practices in the application process in order to help you get the
job you want!&lt;/p&gt;
