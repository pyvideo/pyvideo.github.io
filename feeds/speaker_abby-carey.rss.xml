[EuroPython 2021 - Talk - 2021-07-30 - Brian]
[Online]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Abby Carey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to build Flask apps for Cloud Run, one of Google Cloud's serverless platforms. To accelerate the Cloud Run development loop, we'll be using Cloud Code, an IDE plugin that makes working with Cloud Run easy. We'll also cover how to integrate products like Cloud SQL, Pub/Sub, and Secret Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

Beginner mistakes with privacy and ownership
GDPR shook things up for tech in 2018. CCPA is doing the same. It’s our responsibility to respect our users’ data. But as beginners, sometimes we don’t know better. We’ll walk through morally grey mistakes I’ve made when creating client-facing Flask apps and how to fix them up like a good netizen.&lt;/p&gt;
