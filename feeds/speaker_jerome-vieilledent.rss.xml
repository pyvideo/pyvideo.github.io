Unlike traditional APMs on the market, it focuses on the quality of the data it collects, rather than its quantity, in order to make sure developers know quickly what they can do to fix issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how developers can see in real-time how end-user perceive the performance of an application, and the several levels through which Blackfire can drill down in order to find the root cause of issues.
We’ll see how Blackfire can be used within CI/CD or any testing pipeline, to prevent issues from being released to production.
And we’ll see how Blackfire can be used on a development machine to reproduce and analyze issues, as well as validate code iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

Profiling an application should always be the first step in trying to improve its performance. With this workshop, learn how to identify performance issues in your application and adopt the best profiling practices in your daily development habits. This workshop will use the Blackfire.io tool to help you identify performance leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

It should be tested, and cared for like any feature. Using the right tools to understand how code consumes resources, and how to match a given performance budget is key. That discipline can become seamless, from development, to test/staging and production.
This workshop will give tips and tricks to master performance optimization on an example Django application.&lt;/p&gt;
