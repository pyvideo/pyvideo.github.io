Oracle Public Cloud. It is developed in Python, and operates within a
restricted Python environment, but has been designed to overcome the
challenges of our enterprise environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide an overview of the restricted Python environment
in which Sherlock operates and discuss how Sherlock has leveraged
features of Python to maintain its independence. It will highlight the
design challenges that were faced to ensure that the framework could be
robust and lightweight. As part of the talk, I will showcase how we've
utilised Python's strengths to provide a framework which easily allows
developers from vastly different teams to write diagnostic scripts to
easily asses service health across a global fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
