isolation and producing a static report to present at a quarterly
meeting. Decision makers in companies have been inspired by the types of
insights the data can offer and are asking more questions of it, such as
what happens if I change this variable or where did this result come
from. Data scientist regularly now present their analysis not in reports
but in web apps or behind APIs that allow this kind of interrogation. We
have been building data science solutions for 10 years and have learnt
many lessons along the way. In this talk we will run through how to
build performant, scalable and validated data science web apps, using
python.&lt;/p&gt;
