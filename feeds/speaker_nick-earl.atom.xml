The talk discusses three spectroscopy-focused packages at different stages of development and how we plan to ensure community traction while working under bureaucratic constraints, building in inter-operatibility with other python packages, and providing accessibility for contributors of a wide range of programming backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
