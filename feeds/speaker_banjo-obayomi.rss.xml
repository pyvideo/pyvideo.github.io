For python developers frameworks like Django take time to learn and come with many bells and whistles that may not be needed for simple applications. Streamlit is a framework that blends raw python code with a simple API that turns scripts into shareable web apps in minutes., without needed any front end experience. This talk will walk through creating a Streamlit app and showing off how flexible the framework is for building solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
