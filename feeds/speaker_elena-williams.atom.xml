individuals who love to take on exciting new extra-curricular projects
in their massive amounts of spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Django podcast is an excellent example of this kind of project and it
is one that has been taken up no less than 5 times so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the latest to take up this torch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has so far been an amazing, educational, exhilarating experience: I
have had the honour of gathering the thoughts of some of the best,
brightest and most prolific in our community. It's been a load of work
but also a load of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come hear the story of how this has happened, and come to learn how you
can be part of the greater Django information and communication
machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python
Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring
together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python
from around Australia, and all around the World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia&lt;/p&gt;

make the plunge? Involved with open source but a bit hazy on the way it
all works? Open source legend Andrew Tridgell runs an annual week-long
post-graduate primer course teaching &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Free and Open Source Software
