individuals who love to take on exciting new extra-curricular projects
in their massive amounts of spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Django podcast is an excellent example of this kind of project and it
is one that has been taken up no less than 5 times so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the latest to take up this torch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has so far been an amazing, educational, exhilarating experience: I
have had the honour of gathering the thoughts of some of the best,
brightest and most prolific in our community. It's been a load of work
but also a load of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come hear the story of how this has happened, and come to learn how you
can be part of the greater Django information and communication
machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python
Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring
together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python
from around Australia, and all around the World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August 1-5, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relational and NoSQL DBs have ruled the roost for a couple of decades now, but in real life there's more to data than just tables or key-pairs. Graph DBMS technology has been coming along for the last decade-or-so and is now quite mature. Everyone wants one, just ask a Fortune 500 company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean: why have a table when you can have a knowledge graph? Why not be able to whip up a recommendations engine (or indeed a fraud detector) in a few minutes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graph databases store data in Graphs -- that is NOT chart-visualisation nor syntax standard on API layers (NOT a GraphQL talk), but per the paper written by the mathematician Euler in 1736: those data structures which are &amp;quot;nodes&amp;quot; connected by &amp;quot;relationships&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will be a primer on what this all means, how they work and when they're a good idea to use. There will also be a demonstration and discussion about how to kick off with graph DBs driven by python, specifically for people who are familiar with conventional databases, but have never used Graph databases before, but might be curious.&lt;/p&gt;
