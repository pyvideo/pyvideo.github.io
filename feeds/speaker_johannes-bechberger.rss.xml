It had only the simplistic sys.settrace API, which had a high overhead and couldn't be configured appropriately. The new API, released in October 2023, will change this by offering a proper fine-grained and well-designed monitoring API while also making the commonly used operations fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will give you an introduction to the new API and its design major design decisions and show you how you can use it to write a simple debugger from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
