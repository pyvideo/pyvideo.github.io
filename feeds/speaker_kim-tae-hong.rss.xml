In particular, data pipelines using Apache Kafka are being developed. I would like to share my experience developing an Apache Kafka consumer using Python through the system development process called real-time threat analysis. Through this presentation, I hope to be helpful to those who want to develop a service that collects real-time data to Apache Kafka and quickly develops a consumer using Python to process data. The main contents of this presentation are as follows. - Concepts required for data pipeline development - Introduction to Python Kafka client library - Experience in developing real-time data processing pipelines For questions and inquiries, please contact &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:rlaxoghd91&amp;#64;gmail.com"&gt;rlaxoghd91&amp;#64;gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.
