&lt;p&gt;On February 11th 2016 Ligo-Virgo collaboration gave the announce of
the discovery of Gravitational Waves, just  100 years after the
Einstein’s paper on their prediction.
A brief introdutcion to data analysis methods used in Gravitational
Waves (GW) communities
Python notebook describing  how to analyze the GW event detected on 14
September 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 11th 2016 Ligo-Virgo collaboration gave the announce of
the discovery of Gravitational Waves, just  100 years after the
Einstein’s paper on their prediction.
After an introduction on Gravitational Waves, on Virgo Interferometric
detector, I will go through the data analysis methods used in
Gravitational Waves (GW) communities either for the detector
characterization and data condition or for the signal detection
pipelines,  showing the use of python we make.
As practical example I will introduce a python notebook describing
the GW event detected on 14 September 2015 and I will show a few of
signal processing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
