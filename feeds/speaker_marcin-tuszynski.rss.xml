development of Allegro's visual search engine. I will present our entire
journey from the plain idea through different modelling approaches up to
its current solution. Finally, I will provide some tips and tricks that
we have learned along the way and show a lot of images - after all,
that's what you're looking for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can one effectively find a recently seen t-shirt on an e-commerce
platform such as Allegro? Or maybe an unusual set of cups, that is used
by the coffee shop downstairs? One could try to describe them, but a
picture is worth a thousand words - what if that one picture or actually
a photo was enough? With over 100 million offers and with multiple
photos for every product, this seems nearly impossible. Especially given
how similar some products are. During this talk, I will share how we
make it possible by introducing a visual search model. I will focus on
our machine learning model and its evolution over time but also cover
some technical aspects of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;
