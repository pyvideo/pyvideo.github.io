In this talk, we will provide an overview of terminology in reinforcement learning and sample Python programs for basic algorithms to learn policies.  We will also discuss the state of the art in reinforcement learning and the ways in which reinforcement learning can be applied to real world problems.&lt;/p&gt;

As a result, researchers have developed special algorithms for detecting anomalies. In this talk, I will take about three different families of anomaly detection algorithms: Density-based methods, data streaming methods, and time series methods. I will cover both the mathematical and statistical theory behind these algorithms and provide code implementations. Afterwards, I will discuss useful tips I have learned  while implementing threat detection systems in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

Objects are being dealt with that have very little to do with the real world. They are hard to grasp, touch, and feel. Chess on the other hand is a very concrete and physical game. Objects such as the board, pieces, and even logic such as the basic rules of the game are much easier to understand. How the pieces in chess interact, their capabilities, and their placement on the board can be similar to the way objects interact in python. Using chess_py, an open source platform for chess written by me in python, we can delve into the different classes and data structures to understand how they work and gain a deeper understanding of the language of python.&lt;/p&gt;

Ideally, we could translate our questions into code as quickly as we could think! Dplython is an open source Python library (inspired by R's &amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;) that improves productivity by constraining analysis to a core set of the most common data manipulation operations. By mapping the way we think about typical tasks to functions, dplython moves data analysis closer to &amp;quot;speed-of-thought.&amp;quot; In this talk, I'll describe the core ideas behind dplython, present a tutorial on using it for data analysis, and give a technical peek at Pythonic lazy evaluations created with operator overloading.&lt;/p&gt;

Mirabai Knight, a true geek, was so frustrated after she became a professional stenographer that she hired a developer to help her make a FOSS steno solution. Now, the open steno community exists with her passion driving them forward. At the core is Plover, the free software that lets anyone try and learn stenography for free. Around it there are helper tools, learning resources, open hardware initiatives, and more. Ted manages the GitHub repository and is a student of the Open Steno Project himself. He will talk about Open Steno, where it came from, what it was like before it existed, what it's good for, how it works (as a Python application), and where it may go in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

Quite unlike traditional databases, WADE is a framework.

Since the storage layer is implemented by the programmer it can be hand customized to the use case at hand using tools such as LevelDB, RocksDB, or whatever the programmer desires. However, WADE takes control at the networking layer handling replication, message forwarding amongst nodes, and fault tolerance in the event of failure so long as a few simple functions are implemented by the end user.&lt;/p&gt;
