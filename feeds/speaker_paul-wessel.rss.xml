set of command-line programs used across the Earth, Atmospheric, and
Ocean Sciences to process and visualize geographic data. At Scipy 2017,
we presented the project goals and an initial prototype. The feedback
received led to improvements in the design of the library, mainly the
creation of an object- oriented API. We will present the newest
developments including support for numpy arrays and pandas Dataframes,
interactive visualization in the Jupyter notebook using NASA WorldWind,
and more. Once again, we seek feedback from the community to guide us
moving forward.Presenter(s): Speaker: Leonardo Uieda, Department of

Maps generated by GMT are ubiquitous in scientific publications in areas such as seismology and oceanography. We present a new GMT Python wrapper library built by the GMT team. We will show the design plans, internal implementations, and demonstrate an initial prototype of the library. Our wrapper connects to the GMT C API using ctypes and allows input and output using data from numpy ndarrays and xarray Datasets. The library is still in early stages of design and implementation and we are eager for contributions and feedback from the Scipy community.&lt;/p&gt;
