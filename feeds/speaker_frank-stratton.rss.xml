services that can be quickly built, deployed, and scaled. This talk
examines lessons learned from writing these services as well as patterns
found in other platforms. We present a detailed look at the code that
allow us to build dozens of services, serving billions of requests,
while deploying to our cluster over 20 times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
