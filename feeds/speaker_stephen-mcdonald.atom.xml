today - do we use a micro or a monolithic framework? Do we use a CMS or
roll our own? Mezzanine is one project that aims to simplify these
questions with a compelling offering for developing Python powered
websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Stephen McDonald the creator of Mezzanine will walk
through the history of Mezzanine, covering the constraints that have
dictated its design, its approach to providing simple yet flexible,
rapid web development, through to the software eco-system and community
that have developed around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen McDonald is a software engineer who has worked in the web
development space since the late 90s, when Netscape Gold and ICQ reigned
supreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Stephen works with several startups using Python and Django.
By day he's the technical lead at Mathspace, applying machine learning
techniques to transform maths education. By night he works on scaling
the news reader Kouio, to handle hundreds of millions of news articles
from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in between these, Stephen is also the creator and maintainer
of Mezzanine, one of the most popular CMS projects for the Django
framework.&lt;/p&gt;
