&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people may think that Python is slow because it is compiled to byte
code. This presentation shows that Python can be fast even for
computational intensive applications. In the example presented here,
Python competes with FORTRAN, a programming languages renowned for its
performance and aggressively optimizing compilers. Python offers
powerful data structures such as sets that make writing efficient
algorithms extremely simple. FORTRAN on the other hand, has much less in
such support. For the given example, it takes considerably more
programming in FORTRAN than in Python to achieve similar execution times
for large data sizes. The comparison of program run times and lines of
code, which can be roughly translated into development effort, shows
that Python can actually be faster than FORTRAN under many circumstances
typically found in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
