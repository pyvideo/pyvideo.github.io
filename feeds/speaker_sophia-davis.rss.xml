&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how Python works under the hood? One way to learn about
Python-the-C-program is by exploring the C API for writing Python
bindings to native C libraries. In this talk, we will walk through a
simple example of making a C library callable from Python code and
vice versa. Along the way, we will encounter some essential features
of Python: reference counting, memory management, and the inner-
workings of objects and modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all love Python. It’s so elegant and easy to use as a programming
language that we forget about the giant, complicated C program
executing our strings of white-space sensitive code. For many Python
programmers, this side of Python is just a big black box. It works
well, so thankfully we don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to go messing around inside... but
what if you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to look into the inner workings of this powerful
tool? One way to dive into the C-program-side of Python is by
exploring the C API for writing Python bindings to native C libraries.
In this talk I will explore the basics of this API as I recount my
journey to make a simple C library callable from Python code, and
allow C code to invoke objects defined in pure Python. Along the way,
we will encounter some essential features of Python: reference
counting, memory management, and the inner-workings of objects and
modules.&lt;/p&gt;
