This need came from my own problem of building lots and lots of simple services (usually in Python) and not having the time or desire to build a business around them. These services include Localtunnel, RequestBin, Airscript, and others. Here I'll show these projects, their place in the ecosystem, and what I plan to do about making them sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

gevent and a simple framework called gservice. We'll go from nothing to
a distributed messaging system ready for production deployment based on
experiences building scalable, distributed systems at Twilio.&lt;/p&gt;
