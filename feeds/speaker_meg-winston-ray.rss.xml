Schools have a wealth of ed tech products to choose from, and many
organizations are willing to fund classrooms in this endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why aren’t more students learning programming? How are the gender and
racial diversity gaps in tech industry being perpetuated in the
classroom and what can do about it? Are block-based educational
languages drawing students into computer science?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A programming curriculum writer and teacher discusses the realities of
bringing Python into the secondary classroom. We’ll explore the common
pitfalls and obstacles that teachers and students must overcome, examine
some effective approaches for classrooms with diverse learners, and
discuss why Python is a great fit for the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a device to to collaborate and join the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
