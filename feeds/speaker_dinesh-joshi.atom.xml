build RESTful MicroServices. However, django is perceived to have some
overhead making it hard to build fast and scalable MicroServices. This
talk shows you how to squeeze the last bit of performance from django.
We will focus on django’s key architectural components and the right way
to use them. Using profiling, we will identify bottlenecks and fix them
enabling you to build scalable RESTful services that play to django’s
strengths. At the end of the talk you will have a good handle on
building scalable MicroServices with django.&lt;/p&gt;
