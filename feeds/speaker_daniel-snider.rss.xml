This talk will compare and get people excited about large open-source projects. What makes them great, what doesn't, and where to get started in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

IT. Come listen to my rants and raves about OpenStack, the software that
controls large armies of compute, storage, and networking resources. Why
does OpenStack get so much hype and so much hate?&lt;/p&gt;
