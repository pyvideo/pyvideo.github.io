and its use for distributed computations. As the heterogeneous computing
landscape evolves with the introduction of quantum computers, GPUs, and
specialized hardware, we will explore the interesting patterns in Python
that allow us to interact with this heterogeneity and maximize
performance effectively. The talk will address the challenges of
distributed computations in the heterogeneous computing era, including
monitoring real-time calculations, rapid iteration, prototyping in
complex experiments, and ensuring smooth production runs with long
access queues in specialized hardware. However, we will not only
highlight the difficulties but also share valuable strategies for
overcoming these obstacles and achieving optimal performance in these
environments using open-source tools.&lt;/p&gt;
