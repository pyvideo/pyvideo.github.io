&lt;p&gt;Presented by Brandon Craig Rhodes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python supports two major programming paradigms: procedures, and object
orientation. This talk will claim that, when it comes to code re-use,
these two paradigms are NOT created equal: because object-oriented
programming encourages the programmer to write methods that consider
everything else inside of &amp;quot;self&amp;quot; to be fair game, it encourages highly
coupled code that proves brittle when extended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Augie Fackler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP is the lingua franca of the web, and many things done in Python
depend on it, yet HTTP in Python isn't always as good as one would
expect. It's well worth knowing the options and tradeoffs available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP in Python is very much a mixed bag of available technology. What's
implemented mostly works well, but there are some frustrating gaps in
different libraries that are poorly documented. I've gone wading through
every HTTP library I can find for Python while trying to fix an obscure
bug in Mercurial and decided to write my own. I'll cover what's
available today and why I'm starting from scratch with a completely new
implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
