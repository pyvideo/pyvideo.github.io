Yet, many software developers never consider contributing to the open-source software that they work with, not even when an obvious, direct opportunity presents itself. In this talk I'll try to make a case for why it's in your own interest, as a software developer, to get involved in open-source development, and give a few pointers to those who are interested, but just don't know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
