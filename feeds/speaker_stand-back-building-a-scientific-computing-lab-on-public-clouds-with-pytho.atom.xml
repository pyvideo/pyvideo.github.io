&lt;p&gt;Speaker: Laura Santamaria
As a Developer Advocate at Pulumi, Laura Santamaria loves to learn and explain how things work, bridging the gaps in engineering disciplines. She is a cohost for The Hallway Track podcast, an organizer for DevOpsDays Texas and DevOpsDays Austin, and a co-host for Cloud Austin and Austin DevOps. Previously, Laura worked as a developer advocate at LogDNA and a software developer at Rackspace where, among other things, she owned Deconst, an open-source documentation delivery platform, and MC’ed Rackspace’s internal technical conference. Apart from work, she taught Python for Women Who Code Austin for many years and has been a returning program committee member for Open Source Summit. Outside of tech, Laura runs, plays with her dogs, throws discs, and watches clouds—the real kind.&lt;/p&gt;
