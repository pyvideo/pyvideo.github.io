&lt;p&gt;I reverse engineered a work of art, and this is what I learned by Yair Galler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/i-reverse-engineered-a-work-of-art-and-this-is-what-i-learned"&gt;https://ep2024.europython.eu/session/i-reverse-engineered-a-work-of-art-and-this-is-what-i-learned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of a weekend project which turned into a months long challenge. After coming across a photorealistic painting made entirely out of strings, I wanted to create one on my own. But how? I decided to reverse engineer the algorithm that computes which strings to stretch and in which order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will show how I created a Python algorithm that produces a beautiful work of art. I will cover topics such as greedy algorithms, image processing, color spaces, performance optimization and many other challenges that I encountered while cracking the algorithm. And of course, I'll show the resulting work of art!&lt;/p&gt;
