&lt;p&gt;Describing the relationship between the variables in a study domain and modeling the data-generating mechanism is a fundamental problem in many empirical sciences. Probabilistic graphical models are one common approach to tackle the problem. Learning the graphical structure for such models (sometimes called causal discovery) is computationally challenging and a fervent area of current research with a plethora of algorithms being developed. To facilitate access to the different methods we present Benchpress, a scalable and platform-independent Snakemake workflow to run, develop, and create reproducible benchmarks of structure learning algorithms for probabilistic graphical models. Benchpress is interfaced via a simple JSON file, which makes it accessible for all users, while the code is designed in a fully modular fashion to enable researchers to contribute additional methodologies. Benchpress provides an interface to a large number of state-of-the-art algorithms from libraries such as BDgraph, BiDAG, bnlearn, gCastle, GOBNILP, pcalg, scikit-learn, and TETRAD as well as a variety of methods for data generating models and performance evaluation. Alongside user-defined models and randomly generated datasets, the workflow also includes a number of standard datasets and graphical models from the literature. In this tutorial, the attendees will be shown how to use Benchpress in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
