The talk covers: Exporting with torch.onnx.dynamo_export, Inference with ONNXRuntime, and a variety of of State-of-the-Art models being converted easily. Learn about how ONNX enables more PyTorch models to be cross-platform, all the great benefits of ONNX standard, and all the other features we have baked into the new exporter, including: Symbolic model tracing: Export large models without computation cost involving original data/parameters, saving time and preventing OOM issues. ONNX Script: A new way to architect ONNX Models and the backbone of the Dynamo Exporter Preserving original modules structure as ONNX functions: allowing for a better resulting model that is layered. Better diagnostics: Clearly identify the root of your conversion issues faster!&lt;/p&gt;
