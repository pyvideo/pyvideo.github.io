InsightRX is a precision medicine company whose goal is to ensure that each patient receives the right drug at the optimal dose. At InsightRX, R is a first-class language that's used for purposes ranging from customer-facing products to internal data infrastructure, new product prototypes, and regulatory reporting. Using R in this way has given us the opportunity to forge fruitful collaborations with other teams in which we can both learn and teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me as I share how the skills of data science and engineering can complement each other to create better products and greater impact.&lt;/p&gt;
