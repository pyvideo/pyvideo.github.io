&lt;p&gt;DyND is a C++ library for dynamic, multidimensional arrays. Inspired by NumPy, it aims to be a cross-language platform for data analysis, by bringing the popularity and flexibility of the Python data science stack to other languages, such as C++, R, and Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DyND is a dynamic array library for structured and semi-structured data, written with C++ as a first-class target and extended to Python with a lightweight binding. It aims to be a cross-language platform for data analysis, by bringing the popularity and flexibility of the Python data science stack to other languages, such as C++, R, and Javascript. It is inspired by NumPy, the Python array programming library at the core of the scientific Python stack, but tries to address a number of obstacles encountered by some of NumPyâ€™s users. Examples of these are support for variable-sized strings, missing values, ragged array dimensions, and versatile tools for creating functions that apply generic patterns across arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce the DyND library, motivating it with simple datasets that are hard to process with existing tools. We'll discuss its architecture, features, and a roadmap for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
