community ‐ and it’s not hard to figure out why. According to the World
Health Organization, there are over one billion people globally who need
an assistive device. With these statistics, organizations and open
source projects alike realize that they could be unintentionally locking
these people out of their products. As a result, they adjust their
developer workflows. And it often ends there, at the product.
Documentation is left out of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If documentation is meant to serve as a tool for learning and
comprehension, then it must be included in those conversations. After
all, we want to write docs that are truly for everyone ‐ regardless of
the technology they use to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll look at how assistive technology consumes
documentation and cover some points to consider when building out your
docs. Along the way, we’ll touch on quick regulation wins and inclusive
writing practices.&lt;/p&gt;
