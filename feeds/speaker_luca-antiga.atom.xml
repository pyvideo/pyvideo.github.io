of the next frontiers of DevOps. With the advent of Redis modules and
the availability of C APIs for the major deep learning frameworks, it is
now possible to turn Redis into a reliable runtime for deep learning
workloads, providing a simple solution for a model serving microservice.
In this talk we will introduce RedisAI, a joint effort by Orobix and
RedisLabs that introduces tensors and graphs as new Redis data types and
allows to execute graphs over tensors using multiple backends (PyTorch,
TensorFlow, and ONNXRuntime), both on the CPU and GPU. The module also
supports scripting with TorchScript, which provides a Python-like tensor
language that can be used to facilitate pre- and post-processing
operations, like input shaping or output ensambling. In addition, thanks
to its support for the ONNX standard, including ONNX-ML, RedisAI is not
strictly limited to deep learning, but it offers support for general
machine learning algorithms. In this talk, we will demonstrate a full,
Python-powered journey from fine tuning a model to a scalable Flask +
RedisAI deployment. Last, we will lay down the roadmap for the future,
like automated batching, sharding, integration with Redis data types
(e.g. streams) and advanced monitoring. The talk will include sample
code, best practices and a live demo.&lt;/p&gt;

It has been adopted by tens of thousands of companies and academic groups, contributing to drive the adoption of PyTorch to where it is today. The advent of generative AI has led to new challenges in training large models, and PyTorch Lightning has empowered the industry by making many of the latest innovations accessible and robust. PyTorch Lightning powers state-of-the-art generative AI models like StableDiffusion and SDXL. It has been adopted in exciting new directions for LLMs like Hyena Hierarchy and State Space models, as well as the new RWKW recurrent architecture. On top of all that, the PyTorch Lightning-based NVIDIA NeMo, which includes NeMo Megatron, is enabling companies to train LLMs up to hundreds billions parameters. In this talk we will explore generative AI applications powered by PyTorch Lightning, and cover the latest PyTorch Lightning 2.0 features that make working with large models easy. We will also discuss how Lightning Fabric powers lit-gpt, which has been adopted as the starter kit for the recent LLM Efficiency Challenge at NeurIPS 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today PyTorch Lightning powers training workloads across the industry, from small-scale research to large-scale training endeavors. The package has reached 130M total downloads in June 2024, 2x since early 2023. PyTorch Lightning 2.4 features support for 2D parallelism via DTensors, first introduced in PyTorch 2.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open source stack is completed by Fabric (lightweight building blocks for scaling training workloads), LitGPT (library for pre-training, fine-tuning, serving LLMs), LitData (parallel data processing and streaming data loading), LitServe (lightweight, high-performance serving framework), TorchMetrics (de-facto standard in deep learning metrics), and the recently released Thunder compiler. Together, these packages provide a low-friction, high-performance stack to democratize and accelerate the AI lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stack is optimized to run on Lightning Studios, a PyTorch native, fully integrated AI development environment on the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

This enables practitioners to implement AI models with ease. However, it prompts the question how to optimize the workload for a given hardware setup because those optimizations clutter our code and are tricky to combine. Lightning Thunder provides a Python-to-Python compiler to scale and optimize PyTorch programs that focuses on usability, understandability, and extensibility. A key tool in delivering on these goals is the composability of transformations: without changing the user code, we can stack quantization, distributing the computation across multiple GPUs, dispatching to optimized kernels, offloading, and other pluggable optimizations. Lightning Thunder flourishes in the PyTorch ecosystem: with PyTorch eager and with executors like torch.compile and nvFuser. It also dispatches to libraries like cuDNN, TransformerEngine, Apex, OpenAI Triton. The ability to apply multiple optimizations just-in-time leads to significant compounded speed-ups over unoptimized code out of the box. Luca will discuss the design of Thunder and demonstrate applications on training and inference for large language and multimodal models.&lt;/p&gt;
