&lt;p&gt;I'll review few great ways to test data pipelines in this talk. This
approach's primary goal is to ensure data flows smoothly through the
pipelines by quickly identifying and fixing any problems. While the talk
uses Airflow as the base, the techniques presented are toolkit-agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to testing pipelines, the process is similar to testing
software applications. It includes running unit tests for each pipeline
component, integration tests for the entire pipeline, and end-to-end
tests to ensure accurate data output. However, I'll also discuss unique
methods like data snapshot testing and online and offline data quality
checks.&lt;/p&gt;
