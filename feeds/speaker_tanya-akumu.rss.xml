All You Need is Scanning</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/scipy-2022/searching-for-anomalous-subsets-all-you-need-is-scanning.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts and decision makers seek to understand their data at a subset level as this can reveal insights that are not apparent at global (all records) or local (single record) levels. Unfortunately, there are exponentially-many subsets to consider, and undisciplined, manual inspection covers a tiny fraction of the possibilities. This talk will step through multiple use cases of Subset Scanning and use it to efficiently detect vulnerable/privileged subgroups and detect bias in predictive classification models at the subset level. The code is part of the Linux Foundationâ€™s AI Fairness 360 Toolkit &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ai-fairness-360.org/"&gt;https://ai-fairness-360.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
