Python library for making the common tasks easy to accomplish. The
library is written entirely in Python, meaning that it is not necessary
to have any other tools or libraries installed to make it work. There
are twenty eight utilites that do everything from copying databases to
setting up replilcation with automatic failover in case the master
server fails.&lt;/p&gt;
