interact with Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the most successful open source projects we have been
seriously impressed by the importance of Docker: it is positively
revolutionizing the DevOps industry. Docker is a valid alternative to
the traditional virtual machines and it is redefining the IT service
deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the available Docker APIs, we have witnessed a remarkable
proliferation of tools based on the same APIs to efficiently manage
virtual infrastructures: a place of honor, among of all of these, is
reserved to the libraries and tools written in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is divided into two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first part provides an introduction to Docker by illustrating a
typical use case: a network of micro-services aimed to manage a web
application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second part goes into detail on how to write Python code which
will be able to orchestrate Docker images and containers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
