&lt;p&gt;Scalability is a big problem for everyone who wants to grow. In order

software and hardware should be met. What if hardware was as dynamic
as a service where CPU and RAM could have been acquired when only it's
needed. Is there such an environment? How can you work with it? What
you should be careful of? How your applications should evolve?&lt;/p&gt;
