scaled up to &amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;200,000&lt;/em&gt; users. With an iOS app that's in development,
we expect this to soon double.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've learnt a ton of little things along the way, and have had to make
various architectural and design decisions. In my experience, it's easy
to google and find a lot of information on SO or HN, but it's not always
easy to put these in context to see what's really relevant to you. In
this talk, I'll attempt to talk through the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; behind various choices
we made, and engage in &lt;em&gt;dialog&lt;/em&gt; about how these may be beneficial to you
(or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've provided a link to my slides to serve as an outline that I hope
will open up dialog with others, and help steer the direction of this
talk. Feedback and suggestions are welcome, just mention your
twitter/irc handle in your comments if you'd like to discuss things.&lt;/p&gt;
