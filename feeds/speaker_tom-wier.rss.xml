Assumptions that hold true in urban areas of developed countries often don't in rural or less developed areas, or those affected by conflict. In this talk, I'll be discussing some common issues and pitfalls that developers who usually work in established markets like Europe and North America encounter when writing applications for newer markets in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere. And, more importantly, what we as Django developers can do to overcome these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
