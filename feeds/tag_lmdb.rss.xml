LMDB was written for the OpenLDAP Project and has proved to be the world’s smallest, fastest, and most reliable transactional embedded data store. It has cemented OpenLDAP’s position as world’s fastest directory server, and its adoption outside the OpenLDAP Project continues to grow, with a wide range of applications including big data services, crypto-currencies, machine learning, and many others. The talk will cover highlights of the LMDB design as well as the impact of LMDB on other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
