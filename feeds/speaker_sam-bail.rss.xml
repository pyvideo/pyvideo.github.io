Data quality has been a hot topic for a while, and there are several open
source Python-based packages out there that all cover different aspects of
the broad concept we call &amp;quot;data quality&amp;quot;. But - which one is the right tool
for my use case? What do these tools do (or not do), and how do I know which
one to pick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll first dive into a classification of the different types of data
quality tools in the space, before looking at some hands-on examples of some
of the most prominent packages. We'll be making brief stops at tools like
pydqc, datagristle, bulwark, dvc, dedupe, and Great Expectations, and see
hands-on demos of each tool. The audience will walk away with a better
understanding of &amp;quot;what's out there&amp;quot; and a little boost to get started using
their tool of choice!&lt;/p&gt;
