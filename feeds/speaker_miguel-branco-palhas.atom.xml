Not just code execution efficiency, but also
regarding my work tools, and my usage of them.Having been an avid
programmer and Linux user for several years now, and being obsessed with
my workflow efficiency, I’ve amassed a pretty good understanding of how
to improve productivity when it comes to writing code. From small but
powerful configurations for my text editor that took me weeks to find to
some not-so- well-known tools, I’m always thinking about how I can tweak
my environment and workflow to perfection. Have you ever considered how
many keys you hit during the day? And how can you go about minimizing
that and train your muscle memory to make you more efficient? And what
about that thing you’re not even noticing you’re spending so much time
on, and that you could improve on?This talk will focus on very practical
advice aimed at answering the above questions.&lt;/p&gt;
