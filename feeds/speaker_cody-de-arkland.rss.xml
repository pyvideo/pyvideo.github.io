keeps your platforms running. Python has a number of options for
building backend API's but the most common are Flask and Django. API's
are the backbone of most applications, and shipping new ones is often
risky - but they don't have to be. In this session, Cody will take you
through where he started his coding journey with Python and Flask, go
hands on with examples of backend API's, and show how you can ship
faster and safer using feature flags.&lt;/p&gt;
