programmers instead? In this talk we'll discuss what it means to be a
mediocre programmer. We'll consider the many pitfalls that may befall
you on your journey, from self-doubt to burnout, and share tips for how
to cope with the challenges of programming and when it might be time to
try something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is highlights from a book that I'm writing about the journey
of being a mediocre programmer. Beginners tend to get all of the love,
and advanced programmers get all of the respect and glory. But we don't
have much for helping intermediate programmers. We don't tend to
consider how difficult it can be to work through the exuberance of
beginning programming (where everything is new, fresh, and exciting)
into becoming better programmers. We're just expected to figure things
out on our own. This talk draws on my experiences of being a mediocre
programmer and gives advice and tips on how to become better
programmers. We'll cover how to find a group of traveling companions,
how to focus on learning one thing at a time, and how to deal with the
struggles of our emotions and self doubt. We'll also cover examining our
emotions and understanding when the spark that drew us to programming is
truly burned out.&lt;/p&gt;

isn't behaving and the need to debug the code? Or are you just someone
who prefers using vim and tmux like myself? What if there was a way to
debug your code in an interface that doesn't require a huge IDE in order
to run? This talk will guide you through using vim, tmux, and pudb to
effectively debug code in various situations. We'll show how to insert
breakpoints into the code and do remote debugging, all from the comfort
of a tmux shell.&lt;/p&gt;
