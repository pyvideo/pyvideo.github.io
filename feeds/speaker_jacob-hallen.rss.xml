software development and there lots of tools for collecting and running
tests. There are also lots of instructions for how to use the tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are very few places where you can find out how to write
your code so that it is testable and how to write meaningful tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will focus on best practices for writing tests and you should
come away from it with a better understanding of what kinds of test to
write, when to write them and how to think about testing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk is designed for beginner coders and people who have recently
started to learn Python. We will be using the Python unittest framework
and py.test in the examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyChart is a very nice program for producing print quality graphs.
However, it came equipped with a rather strange API, where every class
was called T. It was also using the global namespace in strange and
disturbing ways. Furthermore, it mixed multiple distinct tasks in some
classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will show how I went about refactoring the package in order to make a
nice and clean API. This talk is focused on teaching refactoring
methodology to beginner and intermediate level programmers. It will also
give a brief introduction to how to make beautiful graphs with PyChart.&lt;/p&gt;
