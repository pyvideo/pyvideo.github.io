Python, Go and Java runtimes. From that time , we have seen many popular
Python web applications deployed on Google App Engine’s Standard
Environment. Even with the awesomeness of App Engine, Pythonistas felt
limited by what the standard environment offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App Engine Flexible Environment (Previously called Managed VM’s) solved
the pain points that developers encountered: It allows developers to
customize their Python runtime and even the underlying operating system
using Dockerfiles. App Engine automatically scales your web app and
offers automatic load balancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore how to implement microservices, authorization,
SQL and noSQL databases, traffic splitting, logging, full text search,
versioning, security scanning, memcache, and content delivery networks
using App Engine Flexible Environment. This will be shown in practice
through the deployment of a Python/Django Application on the App Engine
Flexible Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
