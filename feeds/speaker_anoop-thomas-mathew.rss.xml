But don't know what is all that jargon and how or why these things work,
This talk will give you a decent introduction to Neural Networks (No
boring history lessons or the typical &amp;quot;neurons in brain&amp;quot; talk), and will
give introduction for a hacker to get started with neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
