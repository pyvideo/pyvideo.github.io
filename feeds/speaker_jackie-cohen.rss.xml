programming language for analyzing, and playing with, natural language.
(It’s not the only one, but especially for people just diving in to
using a programming language for language play or research, it’s great.)
Rather than going into details of algorithms, I'm going to give some
simple, easy-to-build-upon examples of how Python and open source Python
packages can be used to quickly dive into some really awesome aspects of
research/investigation in linguistics, and bring them together to
explain, at a high level, why I believe Python is an excellent bridge
between linguists interested in programming, beginning programmers
interested in linguistics, and any curious people who like figuring
stuff out about languages all along a spectrum of formality.&lt;/p&gt;
