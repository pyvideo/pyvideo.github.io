&lt;p&gt;Presented by Catherine Devlin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should your Python program receive commands and deliver results? If
an interactive command-line interpreter is right for you, you're in luck
- Python's got some great batteries included for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is an accepted high-level scripting language with a growing
community in academia and industry. It is used in a lot of scientific
applications in many different scientific fields and in more and more
industries, for example, in engineering or life science). In all fields,
the use of Python for high- performance and parallel computing is
increasing. Several organizations and companies are providing tools or
support for Python development. This includes libraries for scientific
computing, parallel computing, and MPI. Python is also used on many core
architectures and GPUs, for which specific Python interpreters are being
developed. A related topic is the performance of the various interpreter
and compiler implementations for Python. The talk gives an overview of
Pythonâ€™s use in HPC and Scientific Computing and gives information on
many topics, such as Python on massively parallel systems, GPU
programming with Python, scientific libraries in Python, and Python
interpreter performance issues. The talk will include examples for
scientific codes and applications from many domains.&lt;/p&gt;
