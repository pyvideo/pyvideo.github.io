&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe how Gousto, a leading recipe box service based in the UK, is using python to build a personalisation ecosystem. Our menu planning optimisation algorithm allows us to create the perfect mix of recipes, ensuring a variety of dish types, cuisines and ingredients. Our recommendation engine sitting on top of this can then offer each customer a personally curated menu, making sure that users have meaningful choice. All this while ensuring that we are also optimising for maximum performance from the operations point of view!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build this, we have used a range of Python packages, such as DEAP for implementing genetic algorithms, and integrations, such as the one for graph database neo4j.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will give an overview of our methods, our infrastructure, our results and everything that we have learnt along the way!&lt;/p&gt;
