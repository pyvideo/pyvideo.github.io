Reproducible results require reproducible environments so it is important to take matters into your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulp enables large and small organizations to fetch, upload, organize and distribute software packages in a consistent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will focus on how to manage Python packages with Pulp. We will go over use cases like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mirroring PyPI content
managing a carefully curated set of packages
promoting packages through your software development lifecycle
publish immutable snapshots, and rollback when things go wrong.
Stop by and share your use cases and experiences after the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
