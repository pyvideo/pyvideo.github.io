But creating a project that challenges a variety of skill levels is difficult! Using python and the game scissors paper rock we'll show you how we create all kinds of projects as part of a program designed for engaging kids at all levels in programming.&lt;/p&gt;

We'll explore a tried and tested method for creating Minimum Viable Projects, used around Australia to teach kids to code.

&lt;p&gt;The Girls’ Programming Network has a well tested-formula for creating communities of girls and women centred around a passion for coding. But when pandemic strikes, is maintaining communities based around connecting with hundreds of like-minded people even possible? Is it even possible to run an online event that upholds our values? And will kids even want to sign up for more hours of online learning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll take you through how we devised a plan to keep the GPN spirit alive online, with a dynamic schedule of learning, socialising and fun! I’ll show you the tech that made it all possible, tell you the lessons we learnt along the way, and let you in on some of the things we’ll be keeping in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

I was interested to hear more but skeptical that it could lure me away from the micro:bit lifestyle where I’d invested my time learning and developing content. But here I am, 6 months into my Kookaberry journey, and I’m a total convert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll take you through my journey of discovery and show you how Kookaberry gives you an easier entry point to MicroPython and embedded systems for beginners, more extendable, realistic, and relatable project experiences for your existing programmers (without having to get the breadboards out!), and how you can utilise Kookaberry in a huge range of cross-curricular applications.&lt;/p&gt;
