Unleash the creative artist inside you with the beauty of Generative Art. Learn how algorithms are used to create these aesthetic art forms, how motion and structures emit sounds and what toolkits are required to do so. This talk looks at Python as an artistic and visual programming language with the simplicity and beauty of generative art using Processing, PyCairo and webGL. The audience will see an evolution of generative art over the last 50 years, how autonomously these art forms are created using algorithms and how we can stimulate paints and other media. The talk will be showing how to create artworks inspired by geometric and mathematical patterns which also includes randomness with hands-on examples (Two such examples are added here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://imgur.com/a/lycAYnj"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/lycAYnj&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;

Unleash the creative artist inside you with the beauty of Generative Art. Learn how algorithms are used to create these aesthetic art forms, how motion and structures emit sounds and what toolkits are required to do so. The talk will take the audience to a small history of Generative Art and how autonomously these art forms are created using algorithms with various examples using Processing, Numpy, PyCario and more.&lt;/p&gt;

In this talk, the attendees will learn how to blend the 3D animation power of Blender with the 2D plotting capabilities from Python libraries like matplotlib. On top it, attendees learn how to leverage the latex and Manim library to create beautiful mathematical animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will demonstrate some practical techniques to create immersive 3D models with Blender and enhance them with detailed 2D plots, providing a comprehensive narrative for data interpretation. By integrating these data-viz tools, devs and data enthusiasts will discover new &amp;amp; impactful ways to leverage Python to present and communicate their data insights from educational and work projects.&lt;/p&gt;

for building great products and enhancing user experience. Python is a
versatile and popular programming language that is widely used for a
variety of tasks, including web development, data analysis, and machine
learning. UX, or user experience, is the process of designing products
that provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn about this powerful intersection of UX design and Python
programming by understanding how Python can be used to enhance the user
experience and provide practical examples on how UX designers can
automate tasks, gather and analyze data, develop personalized
experiences, and continually improve their own skills and processes.&lt;/p&gt;
