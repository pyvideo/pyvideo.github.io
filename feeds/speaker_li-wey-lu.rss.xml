discussion regarding the best topics to study. We hope to show how we
have utilized python to within our area of study and why it is important
for future students. Our goal is to encourage future classes of students
to enjoy scripting. We will introduce how we as security students
utilize Python as an everyday tool with specific examples of how we used
Python in various security competitions and gave us a noticeable
advantage over other teams. This will include scripts used as defenders
against various red team attacks&lt;/p&gt;
