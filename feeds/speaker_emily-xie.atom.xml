&lt;p&gt;This tutorial walks through Processing.py from the ground up––from initial setup &amp;amp; foundational concepts, to the library's core functions, as well as its more advanced features. Topics covered include the coordinate system, shape primitives, lines, stroke, fill, color, mapping, events, and transforms. At the end, we'll break out of the tutorial format and give free reign for attendees to create, tinker, and experiment freely with the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll walk away with an art piece of your own original design, as well as a newfound appreciation for Python as a medium for creative expression.&lt;/p&gt;
