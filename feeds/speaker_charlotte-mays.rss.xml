and then get overwhelmed and leave. Project maintainers often want the
help, but don’t realize how they are inadvertently appearing
unwelcoming. I will discuss some of the most common complaints I’ve
heard from new coders who tried to contribute but left in frustration,
and ways that these can be addressed without putting too much burden on
the maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will feature a few off-the-beaten-path applications of APIs. Since the combination of Django and DRF makes it so easy to get a simple API running, it becomes a very powerful, flexible, and expandable tool for a variety of uses. The only thing these applications may have in common is their need to share data across the web. Whether you have not yet tested the waters of Django Rest Framework or you are a DRF veteran, this talk will inspire you to think both big and small when considering its potential uses.&lt;/p&gt;
