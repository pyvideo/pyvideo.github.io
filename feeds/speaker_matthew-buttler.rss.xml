support and how that relationship can embolden your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation can make or break a support interaction. Your average
customer or client isn't interested in a lot of work to use your
product. They need to know how to make your product do &amp;quot;the thing&amp;quot;
without, say, opening a Rails console, or doing some other godforsaken
programming trick that you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not know this but your support team has a life of its own that
you haven't seen. Having been a documentarian in the context of a
support team, I have some pretty interesting things to talk about how
you can weave relationships to make everyone's life better, all the way
up the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll talk about how working in partnership with your support team can
not only focus your docs to the points that matter, but let you see how
operating as connective tissue between departments makes everyone's life
easier.&lt;/p&gt;
