In this talk, I'll explain how we built the 'librarian' framework with FastAPI, postgres, and Globus to ease this challenge. Designed for the Simons Observatory's petabyte-scale data transfer, I'll cover building reliable web services, flexible development with dependency injection, effective testing with pytest, and deployment using NERSC's Spin. I hope to demystify web and database programming for a scientific audience.&lt;/p&gt;
