I’d like to talk about the work my team does to develop user-friendly Shiny applications that look and feel like full websites and share some of the tools we use. This includes things like designing landing pages, creating detailed “About” pages, letting users share links to specific charts or download static versions, adding social media sharing links, site meta tags, sub-URLs, and so much more. After attending this talk, I hope others are excited about leveraging tools to make their users say “Wait, that’s Shiny?”&lt;/p&gt;
