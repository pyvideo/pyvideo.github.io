&lt;p&gt;Since the release of PyTorch 2 in 2023, torch.compile() has spurred significant new thinking around DL compiler designs at the framework level. In this session, we invite leaders in this space to share their insights based on real experiences of building DL compilers – Triton, TorchInductor, Halide, TVM, OpenXLA, and Mojo – and growing their ecosystems. We also invite a ‘compiler user representative,’ together.ai, to share their recent journey of redesigning the LLM inference stack around torch.compile(). Each leader will give a 10-minute lightning talk and an engaging panel discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

These approaches have often been positioned as being at odds with one another - and indeed the software solutions either side have sometimes made it such. MLIR, since inception, aimed to enable general, beneficial composition instead. Rather than treating kernels as a black box escape hatch, treat it as a peer in solving the serving needs. This is not magic and requires consideration of how best to combine. In this talk I'll present the approach and effect of this both in IREE and OpenXLA.&lt;/p&gt;
