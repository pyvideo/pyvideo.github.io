Some of these have ended in disappointment because the theoretical guarantees did not translate in to practical possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will explain why you are wherever you are at the time of the talk (even if you're not in this talk): PyCon UK has been scheduled using this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll go over some of the mathematical background to linear programming and also discuss other solution approaches to these types of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
