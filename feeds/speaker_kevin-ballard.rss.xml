Built with Python using Redis, gevent, and Cython, it currently handles
over 6M events/sec with strong consistency guarantees. This talk will
present an overview of its design, and discuss the challenges and
solutions encountered in the process of building a high throughput, low
latency distributed service.&lt;/p&gt;
