&lt;p&gt;Mutation Testing reveals these cases. It makes lots of slightly altered
versions of your code, called &amp;quot;mutants&amp;quot;. If any mutants let all of the
code's tests pass, you probably have gaps in your test suite,
ineffective code, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will tell you what mutation testing is, how it works, how to
use it, and its benefits, drawbacks, inner workings, and history. There
will be several examples, and a list of tools for many popular
languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will come away equipped with a powerful new technique for making
sure your tests are strict and your code is meaningful!&lt;/p&gt;
