I will tell attendees about info about PyCon US 2023: registration, schedule, venue, etc. While this year's travel grant application has closed, it's still worth knowing that it exists and I will share how attendees can stay updated on PyCon US news so they can apply for next year's travel grants. I'll also share how attending PyCon has impacted my personal growth and career and opens up opportunities, and I would love for more people to have the same experience by attending PyCon US.&lt;/p&gt;

Lightning Talk: During this lightning talk I'll present Pooch, an open-source Python library for downloading and catching data files from the web. It provides easy ways to download data files from different protocols, cache it locally, check their integrity through checksums, and more. It also provides tools for downloading collections of files, useful for managing sample datasets for scientific and data-processing Python packages. Currently Pooch is being used by well-known libraries like SciPy, scikit-learn, Xarray and scikit-image, amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;
