wrap up your app and everything it needs to run: code, runtime, and even
system libraries and guarantee that it will always run the same,
regardless of the environment (local machine, server, or even the
cloud). Whether you're deploying a web app, performing data analysis, or
creating local environments for your dev team or CI builds, Docker can
help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll give an introduction to Docker, an overview of some of the current
tools in the Docker ecosystem (Docker Machine and Docker Compose) and
demonstrate how to create, build, and deploy Python applications using
Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk is targeted towards web developers, data scientists, or really
anyone who develops using Python that would like to learn more about
Docker and how it can help their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
