on your data you often have to overcome several obstacles. One challenge
is to understand your data and to form a training and test dataset.
Another one is to get your algorithms and its performance accepted and
integrated in your existing processing workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convolutional Neural Networks have become a standard tool in processing
image data. They have shown to reach human-level classification
performance on some object recognition tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will present my experiences in getting started using a
convolutional neural network for classification of 2D sensor data. I
will point out the importance of understanding your data and give hints
of how to select your train and test datasets according to the
requirements. Furthermore, I will show how to get a feature extractor
out of the classifier and how to visualize it.&lt;/p&gt;
