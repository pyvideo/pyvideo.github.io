Memoranda (LIM), which can be a time-consuming process. A lightweight
python application was built to interact with an ArcGIS map to automate
this mapping process, giving consistent high quality outputs. The
application was built to be used by non-technical staff with no python
or mapping experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important service provided by local councils is the production of
LIMs (Land Information Memoranda), which collate information and
consents pertaining to a specific property. An essential part of the
process is the creation of a series of maps showing the interactions
between the property in question and the other layers of spatial
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These maps can be produced manually, on a case-by-case basis, but this
is a time-consuming process and leads to discrepancies in map output
formats between different properties. We built an application that takes
user inputs such as the property address, and automatically creates the
appropriate series of maps for that property. This approach offers
considerable advantages in speed and consistency of outputs in
comparison to a more manual method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application is built using only the Python modules that ship with
ArcGIS 10.1, enabling the program to be run without having to install
extra software on client computers. It references a static map document
that holds all the spatial and attribute information. The program is
operated via a simple tkinter graphical interface, making it easy to use
for non-technical staff without knowledge of either Python or of ArcGIS.&lt;/p&gt;
