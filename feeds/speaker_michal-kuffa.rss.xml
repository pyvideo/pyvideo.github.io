going on in your network almost in real time. As the network grows, to
store and analyze collected flow information starts to be a tedious
task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this talk is to outline how to use open source
technologies to move from RRD files as a mean of storage of flow data
and take full advantage of Netflow's (almost) real time nature to create
NIDS with all the related data right at hand, visualized and ready to be
diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
