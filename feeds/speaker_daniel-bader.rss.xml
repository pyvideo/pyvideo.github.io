&lt;dt&gt;The story of how I used Python + Django to build and launch a tiny paid SaaS app in two weeks and how you can do the same. The goal of my talk is to show you how to use the Shopify app store as a test bed for your own Python SaaS apps and to help you avoid the mistakes I made.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We will cover the general logistics of a project like that and how you can leverage your Python skills to either gain experience building and launching software products, or to get exposure for your consulting services.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
