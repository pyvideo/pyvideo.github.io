&lt;p&gt;This talk will tell our story â€“ two friends who were curious what trains
were going past one of their houses every five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than buy an over-priced Windows-powered monstrosity(!), we'll
explain how we built an open-source train announcement board using an
LCD display, powered by a RaspberryPi. We'll run through how we started
with way too grand a plan, how we de-scoped the project and how we built
it over the course of a weekend city break. Naturally, the talk will end
with a demo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees should come to learn what it takes to scrape train data and
present it on a RaspberryPi LCD but stay to hear about coding city
breaks!&lt;/p&gt;
