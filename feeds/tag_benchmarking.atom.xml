software projects over their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As software projects mature and become more robust against bugs, they
may also lose some of their runtime performance and memory efficiency.
Airspeed velocity (asv) is a new tool to help find those performance
degradations before they get out to end users. It automatically runs a
benchmark suite over a range of commits in a project's repository, as
well as in a matrix of configurations of Python versions and other
dependencies. The results, possibly from multiple machines, are then
collated and published in a web-based report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While filling a similar role as projects such as &amp;quot;codespeed&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;vbench&amp;quot;, airspeed velocity is designed to be easier to set up and
deploy, since it uses only a DVCS repository as its database and the
report is deployable to any static web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airspeed velocity provides an easy way to write benchmarks, inspired by
&amp;quot;nosetests&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;py.test&amp;quot;. It is possible to benchmark runtime, memory
usage, or any user-defined metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other features either implemented or in the planning stages include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tight integration with existing profiling tools, such as RunSnakeRun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parameterized benchmarks to investigate how an algorithm scales with
data size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automatic search for degrading commits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation will provide a demo of airspeed velocity, and discuss
its early usage for benchmarking the astropy project.&lt;/p&gt;
