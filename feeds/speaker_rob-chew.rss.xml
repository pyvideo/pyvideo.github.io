between actors, is used throughout the social and natural sciences to
discover insight from connected entities. In this tutorial, you will
learn how to use the NetworkX library to analyze network data in
Python, emphasizing intuition over theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods will be illustrated using a dataset of the romantic
relationships between characters on &amp;quot;Grey's Anatomy&amp;quot;, an American
medical drama on the ABC television network. Analysis and intuition
will be emphasized over theory and mathematical rigor. An
IPython/Jupyter notebook format will be used as we code through the
examples together.&lt;/p&gt;
