technology foresight from identifying a data-source, getting the data
and data cleaning to presenting the insights in meaningful
visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This talk presents a very hands-on approach for identifying research and
technology trends in various industries with a little bit of Pandas
here, NTLK there and all cooked up in an IPython Notebook. Three
examples featured in this talk are: How to find out the most interesting
research topics cutting edge companies are after right now? How to pick
sessions from a large conference program (think PyCon, PyData or Strata)
that are presenting something really novel? How to automagically
identify trends in industries such as computer vision or
telecommunications? The talk will show how to tackle common tasks in
applied trend research and technology foresight from identifying a
data-source, getting the data and data cleaning to presenting the
insights in meaningful visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;
