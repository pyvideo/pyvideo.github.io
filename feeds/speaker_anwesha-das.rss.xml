Audience participation will be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fake news on social media, dragnet collection of personal data, being asked to write code for the benefit of your employers but that's not necessarily helpful for your users, using big data to analyse the behaviour of users, government control of the internet, violations of FLOSS licenced code. These subjects and more like them are ripe for discussion in this panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think &amp;quot;Question Time&amp;quot; on BBC1 at 10:30pm on a Thursday and you have a pretty good idea of what it will be like.&lt;/p&gt;

The
permission and/ grant includes the grant to use, to redistribute, to
prepare derivative works etc. These software licenses also set forth the
limitations over these aforesaid rights. The software licenses basically
marks the boundary for the usage of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore from the above mentioned introduction it very clear that it is
very important for developers to choose the license for their code
wisely and correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyPI, the Python Package Index is a repository of software for the
Python programming language. There are currently 80000+ packages there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will go through the licenses of the top 2500 packages. We will
see the trend of choosing a license for these top Python projects. We
will discuss the licenses individually, compare them with each other.
the advantages and disadvantages of the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will further explain that why a license and/or licenses are being
favored by the developers.&lt;/p&gt;
