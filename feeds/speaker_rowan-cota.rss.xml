Our
docs were kept in numerous places, from Google Drive to Wikis to Github
folders to...places we may not even have found yet! In response we
started a working group called The Better Docs Project, with the mission
of organizing, standardizing, and completing our documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk we’ll go on a narrative journey through the first year
of Better Docs, talking about what worked for us, what didn’t work, what
we’re excited to try next, and the lessons we’ve learned (and friends
we’ve made) along the way. I’ll share actionable tips for how to steal
our experience to get your own projects and workplaces on the road to
Better Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
