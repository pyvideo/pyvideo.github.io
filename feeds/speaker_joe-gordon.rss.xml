Thankfully syntax
trees provide a safe and quick way to automatically apply repetitive
transformations. Leveraging syntax tree based tooling (based on
lib2to3), has been a critical component of Pinterest's Python 3 upgrade
strategy, and saved us countless hours of work. Learn how syntax trees
work, how they are used to transform code, and how you can quickly write
your own transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

systems from Python2 to Python3. A large, tightly coupled codebase with
over 2 million lines of code, the Pinterest codebase contained nearly
every edge case that might exist in a Py2 to Py3 migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll cover our approach, gotchas, and tools, and the incredible impact
our migration has made on infra spend and code quality.&lt;/p&gt;

This was done by understanding how a significant amount of latency and consumed resources were the result of geventâ€™s cooperative multitasking. 4 different open source python profilers, were then used together to identify and fix bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the code base. Most profilers are too slow to use in production, so profiling of web servers often occurs in synthetic environments. But to get an accurate picture of what is happening you need production profiling data, so a production ready Linux signal (SIGVTALRM) based python profiler was used. This talk will cover how Pinterest shrunk their front-end fleet, the techniques and tooling used to improve performance and how they can be applied elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
