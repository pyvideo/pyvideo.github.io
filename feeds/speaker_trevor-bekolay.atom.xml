programming language heavily used in science and a possible unification
of the existing packages that enable the majority of use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors: Bekolay, Trevor, University of Waterloo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track: General&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code that properly tracks the units associated with physical quantities
is self-documenting and far more robust to unit conversion errors. Unit
conversion errors are common in any program that deal with physical
quantities, and have been responsible for several expensive and
dangerous software errors, like the Mars Climate Orbiter crash. Support
for tracking units is lacking in commonly used packages like NumPy and
SciPy. As a result, a whole host of packages have been created to fill
this gap, with varying implementations. Some build on top of the
commonly used scientific packages, adding to their data structures the
ability to track units. Others packages track units separately, and
store a mapping between units and the data structures containing
magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will discuss why tracking physical quantities is an essential function
for any programming language heavily used in science. I will then
compare and contrast all of the packages that currently exist for
tracking quantities in terms of their functionality, syntax, underlying
implementation, and performance. Finally, I will present a possible
unification of the existing packages that enables the majority of use
cases, and I will discuss where that unified implementation fits into
the current scientific Python environment.&lt;/p&gt;
