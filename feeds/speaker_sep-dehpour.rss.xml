new door for you. However, with great power comes great responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk we explore magic method's capabilities by first designing
new interfaces in a series of fun experiments. Secondly, we play with
creating undeletable objects and learn about the mighty Garbage
Collector in cPython and how a single magic method can overturn the fate
of the object. Lastly, we create a lazy Redis client to illustrate a
practical application of magic methods and learn about lazy loading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you see what magic methods can bring to the table, the limit is
only your imagination!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know about objects __dict__ and __slots__ and what they hold? Hashing unhashables? Objects with loops pointing to themselves? Objects that have changed and you want to know how? No? Then this is the talk for you. In this talk we will learn a lot by diffing Python data types and objects, the same way that you can learn a lot about code by git diff. May the diff habit be with you!&lt;/p&gt;
