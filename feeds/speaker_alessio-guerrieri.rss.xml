Explaining Machine Learning predictions in Python with Shap</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/pycon-italia-2019/please-tell-me-why-explaining-machine-learning-predictions-in-python-with-shap.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will discuss the problem of making results coming from
machine learning models understandable to both the data scientists and
the final users. While most machine learning frameworks already include
metrics that measure the importance of different features during
training, fewer allow us to understand which features were most
important for a specific prediction at runtime. We will describe our use
case, discuss a few options and finally present Shap, an open-source
python library able to interpret many different models. Shap comes with
both general purpose tools and specialized tools for families of machine
learning models and with integrations for Jupyter and Matplotlib for
easy use during exploration and testing of a model.&lt;/p&gt;
