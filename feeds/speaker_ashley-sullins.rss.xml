Your Guide to the Wacky World of DNS</title><link>https://pyvideo.org/djangocon-us-2018/whats-in-a-name-your-guide-to-the-wacky-world-of-dns.html</link><description>&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you built a Django application. That’s great! Now, how do you get
the app connected to your fancy domain name for the world to see? During
this talk, you’ll learn about the phone book of the internet, otherwise
known as the Domain Name Systems (DNS). We’ll go over topics such as:
why DNS was created, how it works, and why it’s important for developers
have a good understanding of DNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a web developer who has launched hundreds of websites, I’ll tell you
stories of some of my own DNS disasters and odd quirks that I’ve ran
into over the last 5 years. If you’ve ever wondered why you can see your
newly launched website but your coworker can’t, or if you’re ready to
launch your first client website, but not take down their email in the
process, you won’t want to miss this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
