geospatial data often takes center stage in projects it's incorporated
into. Its star power and intimidating array of fellow-travelers (GDAL,
et al) can make it easy to discount its value in simpler supporting
roles or behind-the-scenes. Looking beyond the typical analysis and
visualization toolchains--and their extreme learning curves--this talk
demonstrates some comparatively low-lift patterns for leveraging geodata
in a web application back end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll begin by briefly discussing how geospatial data differs from other
data types, how it is commonly formatted and made available, and which
aspects (spatial reference identifiers, e.g.) are crucial to maintaining
data correctness. Having laid out a few fundamentals we will look at
PostGIS, an open-source extension to PostgreSQL which enables support
for spatial datatypes, functions, and indexes. Finally, we'll look at an
example application based on the FastAPI web framework which uses
features of Pydantic and SQLAlchemy + GeoAlchemy 2 to implement custom
geospatial validations for inbound requests.&lt;/p&gt;

within fire zones but also affecting communities far away through smoke
and poor air quality. In this talk, we'll explore the world of
wildfires, understanding common terminology and clearing up
misconceptions. We will explore data sources, potential file formats,
and essential data fields using fire perimeter data. By leveraging
Python and Geopandas we will clean a dataset, analyze the cleaned
dataset, and finally create compelling visualizations of our wildfire
data.&lt;/p&gt;
