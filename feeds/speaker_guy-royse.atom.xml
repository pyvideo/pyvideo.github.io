recognize hand-written runes from the Younger Futhark. We'll be using
Keras to write easy to understand Python code that creates and trains
the neural network to do this. We'll wire this up to a web application
using Flask and some client-side JavaScript so you can write some runes
yourself and see if it recognizes them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vikings came from the land of ice and snow, from the midnight sun,
where the hot springs flow. In addition to longships and bad attitudes,
they had a system of writing that we, in modern times, have dubbed the
Younger Futhark (or ᚠᚢᚦᚬᚱᚴ if you're a Viking). These sigils are more
commonly called runes and have been mimicked in fantasy literature and
role-playing games for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, having an alphabet, runic or otherwise, solves lots of
problems. But, it also introduces others. The Vikings had the same
problem we do today. How were they to get their automated software
systems to recognize the hand- carved input of a typical boatman? Of
course, they were never able to solve this problem and were instead
forced into a life of burning and pillaging. Today, we have deep
learning and neural networks and can, fortunately, avoid such a fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we're done, you'll understand how Convolution Neural Networks work,
how to build your own using Python and Keras, and how to make it a part
of an application using Flask. Maybe you'll even try seeing what it
thinks of the Bluetooth logo?&lt;/p&gt;
