It provides familiar, high-level interfaces to extend the PyData ecosystem (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn) to larger-than-memory or distributed environments, as well as lower-level interfaces for parallelizing custom algorithms and workflows. In this tutorial we’ll cover more advanced features of Dask like task graph optimization, the worker and scheduler plugin system, how to inspect the internal state of a cluster, and more. Attendees should walk away with a deeper understanding of Dask’s internals, an introduction to more advanced features, and ideas of how they can apply these features effectively to their own data intensive workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

Historically, Dask was the easiest choice to use (it’s just pandas) but struggled to achieve robust performance (there were many ways to accidentally perform poorly). The re-implementation of the DataFrame API addresses all of the pain points that users ran into. We will look into how Dask is a lot faster now, how it performs on benchmarks that is struggled with in the past and how it compares to other tools like Spark, DuckDB and Polars.&lt;/p&gt;
