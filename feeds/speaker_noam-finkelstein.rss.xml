Causal parameters may not be point identified in the presence of unobserved
confounding. However, information about non-identified parameters, in the form
of bounds, may still be recovered from the observed data in some cases. We
develop a new general method for obtaining bounds on causal parameters using
rules of probability and restrictions on counterfactuals implied by causal
graphical models. We additionally provide inequality constraints on
functionals of the observed data law implied by such causal models. Our
approach is motivated by the observation that logical relations between
identified and non-identified counterfactual events often yield information
about non-identified events. We show that this approach is powerful enough to
recover known sharp bounds and tight inequality constraints, and to derive
novel bounds and constraints.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
