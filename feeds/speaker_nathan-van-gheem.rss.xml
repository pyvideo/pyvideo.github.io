This talk will go through understanding what OpenAPI and JSON Schema is, how it can help your organization write better endpoints, why it is superior to alternatives like grpc and how to utilize it in your python projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also describe approaches to integrating OpenAPI and JSON schema into your python projects with simple patterns utilizing dependency injection, automatic definition testing with pytest and output validation. Also, it will demonstrate how using libraries like pydantic will also give you automatic mypy support along with JSON Schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™ll utilize patterns that can be translated to any Python framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded at the 2020 Python Web Conference (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2020.pythonwebconf.com"&gt;https://2020.pythonwebconf.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
