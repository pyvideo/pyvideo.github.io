applying the latest advances in machine learning to creative projects in
art and design. From DeepDream and style transfer to a GAN-generated
painting selling for $430,000 at auction, AI art has moved beyond the
world of research and academia and become a trend in its own right.
Meanwhile, the contemporary art world's fascination with the social
impact of facial recognition, recommendation systems and deep fakes has
encouraged artists to explore AI critically as subject matter. This talk
will give an overview of how artists and technologists are using and
thinking about machine learning, its creative potential and societal
impact.&lt;/p&gt;

applying the latest advances in machine learning to creative projects in
art, music, film, theatre and beyond. From Google's DeepDream and style
transfer to the world's first computer-generated musical playing in
London's West End, more and more creative AI projects are moving beyond
the world of research and academia into the public eye. This talk will
