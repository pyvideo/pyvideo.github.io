kinds of teams to help them use process mapping to document their
processes. Sifting through binders of documentation, pages of
screenshots, and step‐by‐step explanations can be time consuming and
awkward, and large quantities of documentation are time consuming to
keep up to date. System updates would quickly render screenshots
obsolete, and teams were quickly getting overwhelmed, giving up on
documentation entirely. I started to apply my lean expertise to the art
of process mapping, putting together a best practice toolkit to maintain
a minimalist approach to documenting processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll discuss best practice in process mapping for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;visual instruction in user guides and how‐to’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mapping process at high levels, avoiding getting bogged down in
detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assessing possible failure points to anticipate customer pain points
(to manage through customer documentation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
