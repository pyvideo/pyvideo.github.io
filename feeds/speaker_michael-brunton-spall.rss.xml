&lt;p&gt;The Government Digital Service is helping to transform government, helping to provide user led, high quality digital services to make citizens lives easier. One of the projects is based in Birmingham, dealing with giving citizens redundancy pay if their employer goes insolvent. We took a team of .NET engineers with no experience of agile development, and built a project in Python, iteratively, following government security principles. In this session, you'll learn why we picked python, how we convinced management, and how we convinced the developers&lt;/p&gt;
