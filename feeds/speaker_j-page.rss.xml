&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juju is a new opensource configuration management and tool for deploying
services into a cloud and data center environments. Juju provides a
higher level semantic to its users of service level management rather
than machine management. By rethinking this focus, Juju is able to
provide real reuse of service definitions in much the same way that
package management allows deployment and reuse of software bits in many
different context. Jujuâ€™s goal is to be the apt of the clouds. By
providing these higher level semantics to end users, juju aims to be a
preferred solution for deploying services to the cloud. Underneath the
hood, juju is written in python, but part of its beauty is you can write
service definitions in any language. Juju relies on zookeeper for
distributed coordination and state management of the managed machines,
and LXC for higher utilization of machines and minimal separation of
deployed services. It can deploy to physical machines as well as cloud
environments like AWS/EC2 and Openstack.&lt;/p&gt;
