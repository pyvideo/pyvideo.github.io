than ever to neural networks to everything from speech recognition to
generating memes. But when picking a model architecture to apply to your
work, you should consider more than just state of the art results from
NeurIPS. The amount of time, money and data available to you are
equally, if not more, important. This talk will cover some alternatives
to deep learning, including regression, tree-based methods and distance
based methods. More importantly, it will include a frank discussion of
the pros and cons of different methods and when it makes sense to use
each in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

Why can't it handle Portuguese? The answer is most likely &amp;quot;character encoding&amp;quot;. This talk will cover some of the common character encoding gotchas and cover some defensive programming practices to help your code handle multiple encodings.&lt;/p&gt;
