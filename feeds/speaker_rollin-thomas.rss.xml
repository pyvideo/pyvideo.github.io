The workflow of using profiling tools to find candidate kernels for optimization and the techniques for speeding up these kernels will be described. The most successful method used to obtain speedup was just-in-time compiling using Numba; several successful examples will be provided. Parallelization strategies using MPI and Dask will be compared, and preliminary considerations for moving the code to GPUs will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

How do we know? We developed a simple, minimally invasive monitoring framework that leverages standard Python features to capture Python imports and other job data. The data are analyzed with GPU-enabled Python libraries (Dask + cuDF) in a Jupyter notebook, and results are summarized in a Voila dashboard. After detailing our methodology, we provide a high-level tour of some of the data weâ€™ve gathered over the past year. We conclude by outlining future work and potential broader applications.&lt;/p&gt;
