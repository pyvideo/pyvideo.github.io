But they don't need to merely sit on a shelf as museum objects—they can
be reverse engineered and then adapted to modern computers without
modifying the original hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CircuitPython, an implementation of the Python language for
microcontrollers, is an excellent language for projects like these,
thanks to native USB Human Interface Device (HID) support and the
ability to ‘bitbang’ archaic interfaces combined with the fast
development cycle of an interpreted language, as you'll learn in case
studies adapting these keyboards &amp;amp; mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No previous experience with CircuitPython is necessary. Some knowledge
of electronics will enhance your enjoyment of this talk, though there
will be a quick summary of key electronics concepts as the talk
proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
