What's next? In this talk, we cover two simple but powerful tools for keeping your code problem-free. Property-based testing, provided by the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; library, lets you run hundreds of tests from a single template. Contracts, via &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deadpixi/contracts"&gt;dpcontracts&lt;/a&gt;, make your program test itself. You'll learn how and why to use these tools and how to combine them with the rest of your testing suite.&lt;/p&gt;
