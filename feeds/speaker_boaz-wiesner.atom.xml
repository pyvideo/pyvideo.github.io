thousands of daily tasks, each with a different processing time and
resource requirements. We deal with this scale by using Celery and
Kubernetes as our tasks infrastructure, letting us allocate dedicated
workers and queues to each type of task based on its requirements.
Originally, this was configured manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our customer base grew, we noticed that heavier and longer tasks were
grabbing all the resources and causing unacceptable queues in our
pipeline. Moreover, some of the heavier tasks required significantly
more memory, leading to OOM kills and infrastructure issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we could classify tasks by their expected duration and memory
requirements, we could have segregated tasks in Celery based on these
properties and thus minimized interruptions to the rest of the pipeline.
However, the variance in the size and granularity of the fetched data
made it impossible to classify if a task was about to take one minute or
one hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our challenge was: how do we categorize these tasks, accurately and
automatically? To solve the issue we implemented a machine-learning
model that could predict the expected duration and memory usage of a
given task. Using Celery’s advanced task routing capabilities, we could
then dynamically configure different task queues based on the model's
prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raised another challenge - how could we use the classified queues
in the best way? Configuring workers statically for each queue would be
inadequate at scale. We utilized Kubernetes’ vertical and horizontal
autoscaling capabilities to dynamically allocate workers for each
classified queue based on its length. This improved our ability to
respond to pipeline load automatically, increasing performance and
availability. Additionally, we were able to deploy shorter-lived workers
on AWS Spot instances, giving us higher performance while lowering cloud
costs.&lt;/p&gt;
