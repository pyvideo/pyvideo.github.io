Public Cloud is often touted as a cheaper option, but the bills we get in the mail can be long and convoluted. For better or worse, any dollar spent in the cloud is a result of an architecture decision. This talk will give attendees a firm understanding of the relationship between the architecture and the invoice and the key metrics to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will cover:
What is FinOps and why is it important
Key metrics for measuring Cloud spend
Automating Cloud Invoices
Using Python, a SQL database, and FaaS, we can build a pipeline that automatically retrieves our invoice, and populates a searchable table to derive insights such as our top 5 most used services and biggest growing services. Attendees with small developers account to large multi-account deployments will better understand the impact of their architecture on their wallet.
