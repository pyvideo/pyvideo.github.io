However, many components of these solutions rely on domains outside traditional data science — e.g., data, DevOps, and software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll walk through an end-to-end ML solution we built for transplant centers to identify likely stem cell donors. We'll then focus on how interacting with domains outside traditional data science can immensely help a project succeed and increase your impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will take away specific examples of why thinking end-to-end can enhance your ML solutions and how to start applying these principles in your own organization.&lt;/p&gt;
