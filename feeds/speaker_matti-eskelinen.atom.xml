that combines tunable filters with colour sensors. Compared to simpler,
more established imaging systems, this results in some unique challenges
for the data processing. Especially, many of the original imaging
parameters need to be preserved an d joined with calibration-derived
values to actually compute radiance values from the raw sensor data
since they are not automatically handled by the hardware. Handling this
metadata with the resulting hyperspectral images results in combined
datasets of large 3-dimensional datacube, and multiple smaller 2D and 1D
arrays with linked dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have built our solution to this problem utilizing Xarray for handling
the multiple arrays of data as well as the existing Dask integration for
providing easy parallelization for the required preprocessing. Xarray
also provides us many other advantages, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploration of very complex multi-dimensional datasets (especially
when utilizing holoviews)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interoperability with the scikit ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serialization to NetCDF preserving all the data in a single file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our extensive and somewhat non-conventional use of Xarray does
also bring out it's shortcomings when trying to develop such a library
as ours, such as indexing issues with multiple possible overlapping
coordinates and performance issues with complex datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a collection of software for handling hyperspectral data
acquisition and preprocessing fully in Python utilising Xarray for
metadata preservation from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
