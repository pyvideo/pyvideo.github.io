Reducing carbon emissions, saving money on the power bill, and reducing waste are ideas that sound good. But how to go about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home energy monitoring is achievable with a minimal investment in hardware. In fact, hobbyists in our own back yard are running crowdfunding campaigns for it. I got my hands on one and decided to take a look at the insides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside was a small ARM microcontroller, and some electronics for measuring the power. The reference firmware, freely available on Github, was written in the Arduino world. My talk describes the challenges, benefits and pitfalls of starting from scratch with MicroPython. You will leave with an understanding of how to use MicroPython for your next Internet of Things project.&lt;/p&gt;

The core of the software that performs these functions is implemented in Python, allowing easy to read, modify and debug firmware that is traditionally not accessible to a user. This talk will cover the architecture of the OpenBMC and demonstrate how easy it is to support a new server platform by writing a few lines of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
