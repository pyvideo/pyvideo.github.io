Why is that? How do you approach such problems and how to make this a success? Where do you get the privacy-sensitive data from? Do pre-trained networks work? Can we make it scalable in the cloud? I will address these issues with a case study: segmentation of 4D heart MRI for heart function analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
