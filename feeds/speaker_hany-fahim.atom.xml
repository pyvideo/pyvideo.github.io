Back in November 2016, a seemingly innocuous piece of code that has been running for years starts throwing a very strange and nonsensical exception. This strange exception seemed to be thrown completely at random, could not be reproduced in any other environment, and would also self-heal! This talk tells the story of a baffling bug hunt spread over many weeks, involved all members of the company, including the CEO and CTO, and lead us deep into the guts of CPython and countless dead-ends.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk tells the story of how earthquakes and even the Moon force the concept of the &amp;quot;leap second&amp;quot;, and the debacle in 2012 that took down most of the Internet. It also goes into some detail at how Python is handling this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
