In TFP land, effectiveness usually comes from writing model that could generate batch-able functions, and utilizing modern hardware (GPU, TPU) with compiler accelerator (i.e., XLA). I will give a walkthrough on how to do so and highlight some gotchas.&lt;/p&gt;

Where possible/feasible, attendees will build their own tools to help them grasp the underlying concepts. In addition, attendees will be introduced to the pre-built tools in world-class Python and data science libraries to help them capitalize on the efficiencies and utility that those libraries offer.&lt;/p&gt;
