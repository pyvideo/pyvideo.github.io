[EuroPython 2015]
[22 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever feel like your open source project could be better tested? Lack
of tests holding you back from contributors but you don’t know where
to start? You’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[“Adopt pytest month”][1] was held in April 2015. [Pytest][2] volunteers were paired with open source software projects, to find a path to better testing with pytest. Projects varied from  libraries/command line utilities, to a browser, to a complex Django app. In some cases converting existing tests was necessary, in others writing the first tests in existence for non-trivial amounts of code. Two projects were open sourced specifically to take part in “adopt pytest month”. What began as an experiment in increasing software audience proved to be an interesting exercise in strengthening community and most valuable of all, provided a newcomer’s perspective to veteran contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will discuss what worked well with “adopt pytest month”,
what didn’t, what we learned about pytest and what you could take away
for your open source project, be it an improved testing environment or
an improved contributor community. A basic knowledge of testing and
pytest will be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

management system, written in Python and built on Pylons. It has an
unusual development history: custom created for the annual Linux.conf.au
conference, there are yearly spikes in event-focused feature
development, but relatively little of the ongoing development typically
seen in open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pytest is a mature and comprehensive testing suite for Python projects,
but it can be a little intimidating for newcomers. Where do these
mysterious funcargs come from, how do parametrised tests work, and where
are my xUnit-style setUp and tearDown methods?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pytest lives by &amp;quot;convention over configuration&amp;quot; - which is great once
you know what the conventions are. This talk will look at real examples
of pytest in use, emphasising the features that differentiate it from
nose.&lt;/p&gt;

sets with Python. It has excellent integration with Matplotlib, giving
the user highly customisable static plots with ease. But for larger data
sets, a static plot may not be ideal - the ability to pan, zoom, choose
dynamic layers and sample the data at particular points would be nice.
This talk will demonstrate just how easy it is to integrate a Web Map
Service/client such as Pydap/Leaflet.js into the IPython Notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
