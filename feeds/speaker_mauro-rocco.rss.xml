&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celery is an open source task queueing system based on distributed
message passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will talk about the tools that Celery offers for task distribution and
how to monitor and manage the system using a Django web interface. This
talk will also focus on how we use Celery at Jamendo and our real
solutions to some common issues you may encounter when developing a
back-office based on Celery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief overview of Celery and the AMPQ protocol AMPQ protocol
overview, Celery introduction: Celery, RabbitMQ code examples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The impact of Celery on the Jamendo work-flow; examples with real
tasks. Here I will talk about the Jamendo back-office infrastructure
and some of our common tasks. I will discuss the improvements made by
introducing a new back-office system based on Celery. I will show
some code snippets and go over some real scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overview of the Django Celery admin interface and some Jamendo
extensions. Let's talk about the Django-Celery interface that allows
one to monitor or schedule tasks directly from the Django admin. I
will explain which common additional features are necessary and how
to add them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common &amp;quot;gotchas&amp;quot; we encountered while working with Celery and how we
solved them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global task locks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centralized logging: be able to read all the logs of all celery
workers on different servers and filter them for real-time debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
