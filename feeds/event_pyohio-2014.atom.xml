procedural functions inside yoour databases. Specifically we'll cover
the basics of writing a function, touch upon some advanced usage like
trigger functions, and then display some fun things that can be done
when Python runs inside the database.&lt;/p&gt;

system. But did you know that Postgres has a built in publish-subscribe
implementation? This powerful feature offers exciting possibilities for
distributed, data-centric applications.&lt;/p&gt;

very small subset of numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and python. We will then
use a couple of techniques to generate beautiful animations of the
solutions we find. The listeners will see how easy it is to get serious
work done with only a beginner's knowledge of Python.&lt;/p&gt;

human behavior. The concepts in this talk should be accessible to anyone
with basic python knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

map from which direct I/O operations are generally impossible. Instead,
a process has to ask the operating system every time it wants to modify
a file or communicate bytes over the network. By using operating system
specific tools to watch the system calls a Python script is making --
using &amp;quot;strace&amp;quot; under Linux or &amp;quot;truss&amp;quot; under Mac OS X -- you can study
how a program is behaving and address several different kinds of bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
