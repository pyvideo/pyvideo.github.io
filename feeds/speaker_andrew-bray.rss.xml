Despite its power, scrollytelling typically requires specialist web dev skills beyond the reach of many data scientists. Closeread is a Quarto extension that makes a wide range of scrollytelling techniques available to authors without traditional web dev experience, with support for cross-fading plots, graphics and other chunk output alongside narrative content. You can zoom in on poems, prose and images, as well as highlighting important phrases of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Closeread allows authors with experience in Observable JS to write their own animated graphics that update smoothly as scrolling progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
