manipulate data to our hearts content. But what happens when comes to
presenting tables to others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display of tables can be beautiful. Tables can convey information
effectively, just as plots do and, sometimes, it’s the better way to
present data. Truly, the time has come to bridge the divide between raw
DataFrame output and wondrously-structured tables suitable for
publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's review the state of ‘display tables’ in 2024. We’ll go over which
table components make for effective displays of information. It’s
surprising but there are many considerations that go into making a
well-crafted table. We’ll take a look at the combinations of Python
packages that fit together to make this important task possible, and
marvel together at the tabular results they can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
