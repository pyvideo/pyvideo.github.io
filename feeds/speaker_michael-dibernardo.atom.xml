In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well—usually programs they wrote themselves—and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Architecture of Open Source Applications (aosabook.org) is a book series that aims to change this. The fourth volume (&amp;quot;&amp;quot;500 Lines or Less&amp;quot;&amp;quot;, github.com/aosabook/500lines/) contains 20 short examples of canonical programs written and explained by experienced software developers. This talk will give a brief overview of the book, and will explore the most surprising lessons we learned by producing it.&lt;/p&gt;
