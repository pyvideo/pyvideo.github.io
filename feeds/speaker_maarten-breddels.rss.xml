&lt;div class="line"&gt;Sharing the result of a Jupyter notebook is currently not an easy
path. With voila we are changing this. Voila is a small but important
ingredient in the Jupyter ecosystem. Voila can execute notebooks,
keeping the kernel connected but does not allow for arbitrary code
execution, making it safe to share your notebooks with others.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;With new libraries built on top of Jupyter widgets/ipywidgets
(ipymaterialui and ipyvuetify) we allow beautiful modern React and Vue
components to enter the Jupyter notebook. Using voila we can integrate
the ipywidgets seamlessly into modern React and Vue pages, to build
modern dashboards directly from a Jupyter notebook.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I will give a live example on how to transform a Jupyter notebook into
a fully functional single page application with a modern (Material
Design) look.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn your Jupyter notebook into a beautiful modern React or Vue based
dashboard using voila and Jupyter widgets.&lt;/p&gt;

increasingly common task, one that is typically tackled with distributed
computing. Nodes in high-performance computing clusters have enough RAM
to run intensive and well-tested data analysis workflows. More often
than not, however, this is preceded by the scientific process of
cleaning, filtering, grouping, and other transformations of the data,
through continuous visualizations and correlation analysis. In today’s
work environments, many data scientists prefer to do this on their
laptops or workstations, as to more effectively use their time and not
to rely on spotty internet connection to access their remote data and
computation resources. Modern laptops have sufficiently fast I/O SSD
storage, but upgrading RAM is expensive or impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying the combined benefits of computational graphs, which are common
in neural network libraries, with delayed (a.k.a lazy) evaluations to a
DataFrame library enables efficient memory and CPU usage. Together with
memory-mapped storage (Apache Arrow, hdf5) and out-of-core algorithms,
we can process considerably larger data sets with fewer resources. As an
added bonus, the computational graphs ‘remember’ all operations applied
to a DataFrame, meaning that data processing pipelines can be generated
automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will demonstrate Vaex, an open-source DataFrame library
that embodies these concepts. Using data from the New York City
YellowCab taxi service comprising 1.1 billion samples and taking up over
170 GB on disk, we will showcase how one can conduct an exploratory data
analysis, complete with filtering, grouping, calculations of statistics
and interactive visualisations on a single laptop in real time. Finally
we will show an example of how one can automatically build a machine
learning pipeline as a by-product of the exploratory data analysis using
the computational graphs in Vaex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will demonstrate how to explore and analyse massive datasets (&amp;gt;150GB)
on a laptop with the Vaex library in Python. Using computational graphs,
efficient algorithms and storage (Apache Arrow / hdf5) Vaex can easily
handle up to a billion rows.&lt;/p&gt;

Audience level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show how to deal with massive datasets using small resources using the Python Vaex DataFrame library. Using computational graphs, efficient algorithms and storage (Apache Arrow / hdf5) Vaex can easily handle up to a billion rows, even on your laptop. As a bonus, Vaex can automatically generate a Machine Learning pipeline using the graph structure build-up internally in the DataFrame.&lt;/p&gt;

notebook. Being an Jupyter widget, it plays well together with existing
libraries (bqplot, threejs, ipywidgets), and can even be used outside
the notebook for e.g.: outreach, press material or supplementary
material for scientific papers. Ipyvolume support transitions and
animations and uses WebGL to get the best performance.Presenter(s):

&lt;p&gt;I will present two Python packages: Vaex enables calculating statistics for a billion samples per second on a regular N-dimensional grid. Using a new Python package, ipyvolume, that enabled volume rendering and glyph rendering, this allows one to interactively visualise and explore these billion sample tables for high dimensional spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With large astronomical catalogues (＞1 billion) already available, we are preparing for methods to visualize and explore these large datasets. Instead of using cluttered scatter plots, these data volumes require different visualization techniques, in the form of binned statistics, e.g. histograms, density maps, and volume rendering in 3d. The calculation of statistics on N-dimensional grids is handled by Python library called vaex, which I will introduce. It can process at least a billion stars/samples per second, to produce for instance the mean of a quantity on a regular grid. This statistics can be calculated for any mathematical expression on the data (numpy style) and can be on the full dataset or subsets, specified by queries/selections, .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to visualize higher dimensional data in the notebook interactively, no proper solution existed. This led to the development of ipyvolume, which can render 3d volumes and up to a million glyphs (scatter plots and quiver) in the (Jupyter) notebook as a widget. With the browser as a platform, and the release of ipywidgets 6.0, these 3d plots can also be embedded in static html files and renders on nbviewer. This allows for sharing with colleagues, paperless office (render on your tablet), outreach, press release material, etc. Full screen stereo rendering allows for a virtual reality experience using your phone and Google Cardboard, a minor investment compared to other VR head mountables. Overlaying 3d quiver plots on a 3d volume rendering allows visualizing a 6d space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaex and ipyvolume can be used together to explore and visualize any large tabular data set, or separately to calculate statistics, and render 3d plots in the notebook and outside.&lt;/p&gt;
