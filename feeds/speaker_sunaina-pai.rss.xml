&lt;p&gt;This session is about my personal journey of creating and publishing my
first successful open source project in Python. I will share a story
that starts with rewriting my static, shell-script-powered personal blog
generator, then writing 120 lines of Python code, publishing it on
Hacker News, and then trending on Hacker News and GitHub (right next to
Linus Torvalds :-D) for a day of hacker-fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, I will share how 120 lines of Python code written to
solve a personal need helped me to connect with developers across the
world and become a part of a small community of Python coders. I believe
this session will be very useful to beginners who want to take their
first step into creating their own personal Python project and make it
successful.&lt;/p&gt;
