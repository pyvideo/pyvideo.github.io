&lt;p&gt;Queueing systems dominate our day-to-day life: for example supermarkets, airports, traffic systems, and call centres, naming only a few obvious examples. A better understanding of these queues can help businesses and service providers optimise these systems, improving efficiency, profit and satisfaction levels. Sometimes some unintuitive behaviour can arise, and so modelling and investigating queues mathematically has become very popular and important. One prominent method of doing so is by using computer simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will present Ciw, a new Python library for simulating open queueing networks. This talk will demonstrate using Ciw's simple interface to model and simulate a queueing system, and an overview of it's many features will also be given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library is currently being used in two academic settings: one theoretical project that investigates queueing networks that deadlock, and another practical project in which patient flows are modelled in an ophthalmology clinic. Synopses of these projects and their results will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

At Cardiff University there is a dedicated group that uses OR methods such as data analysis, mathematical modelling, and simulation, in the domain of healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many great Python libraries that enable this kind of research. In this talk I will present methods used in two projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modelling cancer diagnostics: Working with a health hoard the sequence of cancer diagnostic tests were modelled. The aim of this project was to investigate which feasible capacity increases would be required in order for patients to meet a 28 day cancer diagnosis target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaluation of Stay Well Plans: Working with another health board the flows of older people around community, frailty, and secondary care is modelled. The aim of this project is to evaluate whether the introduction of personalised Stay Well Plans reduces the frequency patients accessing healthcare facilities; and investigate any changes in demand at various healthcare facilities due to the introduction of the plans.&lt;/p&gt;

Who should I pick? What attacks should they learn? Here, I use multi-objective linear programming, and a bit of simulation, to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I give an example of using Python to solve a combinatorial problem from the mathematical field of Operational Research: How to find the best Pokémon team. Using a variety of Python libraries a mulit-objective linear programming problem is used to find the best combination of Pokémon, and their attacks. PuLP is used to formulate and solve the multi-objective linear programming problems, and a Pareto front is found by varying the importance of each objective. Then, a third objective, a Pokémon team's performance in a Monte Carlo simulation of Pokémon battles, is used to differentiate between Pareto optimal solutions and find the definitive best team of Pokémon. I relate how this fun problem is related to more serious scheduling and timetabling problems.&lt;/p&gt;
