revolution in AI&amp;quot; that is poised to dramatically change the data science
landscape by using AI to automate many of the time-consuming aspects of
applying Machine Learning to real-world problems. Academic researchers,
startups, and tech giants alike have begun developing AutoML methods and
tools ranging from simple open source prototypes to industry-scale
software products. Yet beyond all the hype and vague tech jargon, many
are left wondering: What is AutoML, really? In this talk, I will draw
from my AutoML research experience to discuss the benefits of AutoML and
highlight some promising future directions of the field, including
Python packages and other existing tools that offer AutoML
solutions.Presenter(s): Speaker: Randal Olson, Lead Data Scientist, Life
