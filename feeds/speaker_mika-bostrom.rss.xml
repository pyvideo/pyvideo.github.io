converged towards Continuous Integration (CI) with pull requests (PR).
Automated testing and artifact generation is useful, but the logic is
often flawed: test are run against the source branch, and side effects
from successful merges are not accounted for. Marge-bot improves this
workflow by allowing to test the PR against the target branch while
providing a host of other conveniences.&lt;/p&gt;
