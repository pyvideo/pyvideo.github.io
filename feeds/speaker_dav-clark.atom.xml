deploying scientific compute environments in both educational and
research contexts. After a discussion of how these needs can be served
by devops tools like Docker and Ansible, I argue that a coherent,
easy-to-understand philosophy around reproducible compute environments
is fundamental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the line between developer and researcher becomes ever more blurred,
the challenge of sharing your compute environment with students and
colleagues becomes ever more complex. Large, private organizations have
been grappling with this issue for a while, spawning a great deal of
enthusiasm around tools like Docker, Puppet, Vagrant, and Packer. And
let’s not forget notable python-based upstarts, Ansible and Salt! These
tools can generate immense enthusiasm, followed by the question, “Why
are we doing this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that researcher / developers can become overwhelmed by
the complexity and variety inherent in devops tools - all the while
losing sight of the real reason for using these tools: a philosophy of
documenting your research compute environments in a reproducible
fashion, with a focus on scripting as much as is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At UC Berkeley, members of the D-Lab, the Statistical Compute Facility,
Computer Science and Research IT have organized a project to develop the
Berkeley Common Environment (BCE). I’ll provide an overview of the
challenges we’ve tackled in both educational and research contexts, and
the needs served by the above-mentioned devops tools. In the end, I
argue that a coherent, easy-to-understand philosophy around scientific
compute environments is fundamental - the tools are just a way to make
your collaboration architecture a little easier for the people building
these environments a few times a year. What we should focus on, though,
is end-user experience and research community buy-in.&lt;/p&gt;
