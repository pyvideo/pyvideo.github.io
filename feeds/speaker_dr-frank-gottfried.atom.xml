regulations. The latest regulatorily changes enforces the need to work
on the datasets in this controlled environment without created
additional external copies. However Data Scientists prefer to work with
tools they are most familiar like Python, R and Jupyter Notebooks using
to a large amount of open- source packages (numpy, matplotlib, pandas,
..). SAP HANA provides highly optimized in-database machine learning
libraries. In this talk we will present how a Data Scientist can work in
an environment he/she is most familiar with and access the data stored
in SAP HANA using SAP HANA machine learning libraries with a
scikit-learn type interface. Data will remain in the database and will
be exposed as dataframes (similar to Pandas dataframes). We will explain
the software architecture and present a complete end-to-end use case by
using a Jupyter Notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
