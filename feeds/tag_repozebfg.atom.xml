&lt;p&gt;Presented by Chris McDonough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you a Python web developer who thinks there might be some great
stuff hidden away in Zope but you consider it inaccessible to you
because you feel that Zope imposes too many foreign concepts for your
tastes? Are you a more- or-less happy Zope developer that has the
nagging feeling that much of Zope is unnecessary &amp;quot;baggage&amp;quot; on your
current project? Maybe you're a Plone developer who feels that Plone is
unsuitable for one of your current projects because it's too
complicated? This tutorial will present everything you need to know
about repoze.bfg, a small Python web framework in the spirit of Pylons.
The goals of repoze.bfg are simplicity, familiarity to Zope programmers
(but no Zope experience is required), execution speed, and complete,
comprehensive, and up-to-date documentation. In this tutorial, we'll
explain the core concepts in repoze.bfg, then we'll lead a guided
development session where we make a small application using the
framework. We'll also cover packaging and deployment of the application.
Questions are highly encouraged during the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

philosophy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented by Carlos de la Guardia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BFG is a Python web application framework based on WSGI. It is a &amp;quot;pay
only for what you eat&amp;quot; framework. Meaning that you can get started
easily and learn new concepts as you go, and only if you need them. It's
simple, well tested, well documented, and fast. It also tries to make
development fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will introduce the framework and its philosophy, including
similarities and differences with other frameworks. I will then show
some of the software available in its repository and discuss the
inclusive, loose connection approach that the BFG community prefers for
creating a flexible web development platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Chris McDonough, Ben Bangert, and Mark Ramm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-for-one talk by the main developers of three popular Python web
frameworks! We'll (very) briefly cover the state of each of our
individual frameworks and communities, and then we'll describe the
results of our efforts to work together and share code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pylons is a popular, lightweight Python web framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TurboGears 2 is a full-stack framework built atop Pylons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;repoze.bfg is a moderately popular, lightweight Python web framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main developers and community leaders of these frameworks have been
working together and sharing as much as possible over the course of
roughly the last year. We'll very briefly describe to the audience the
states of our individual efforts, then we'll discuss how we intend to
move forward and share more code and effort in the year to come. The
talk will be more socially- oriented than technical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unusual for open source code and communities to bridge minor
perceived differences in scope and style and to start sharing code and
ideas openly. If you're a user of any of these frameworks, you'll want
to be present for this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
