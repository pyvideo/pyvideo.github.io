At the heart of the issue is application performance, and what's missing is a comprehensive strategy that connects production monitoring to tools that allow you to identify bottlenecks and enforce performance expectations (a performance budget) in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll attempt to show how using Blackfire.io in combination with Platform.sh as a deployment target makes it possible to not only create a Continuous Observability strategy across every application in your organization, but also how the pair makes it possible to make the environmental impact of web development a measurable and optimizable objective.&lt;/p&gt;
