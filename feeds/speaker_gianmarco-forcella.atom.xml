&lt;p&gt;Every wanted to learn Machine Learning, or at least understand the
basics, but you don’t know where to start? Math scares you? Bad
experiences with it during Calculus 1 or at the High School? No worries!
In just 1hr, I’m gonna turn audience into ML rockstars! Machine Learning
is nowadays expanding. As more data becomes available (and power
calculation), so are algorithms that can solve new challenges. But how
does Machine Learning exactly work? And why mathematics shouldn’t be a
stop? In this speech, I would like to give a brief introduction on the
Machine Learning field and explain its concepts in the most easiest and
“Head First” way. Digging in mathematical concepts will be, of course,
necessary, but no prior depth knowledge of math will be required, as I
will try to keep things as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
