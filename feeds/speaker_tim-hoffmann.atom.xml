We feel the performance limitations when doing computationally intensive work. There are many libraries and methods to accelerate your computations, but which way to go? This talk serves as a navigation guide through the world of speeding up Python. At the end, you should have a high-level understanding of performance aspects and know which way to go when you want to speed up your code next time.&lt;/p&gt;

Our optics allow chipmakers to produce smaller, faster and more energy
efficient computer chips. As we move to smaller and smaller structures,
the necessary optics grow more and more complex. Customized simulations
and data analytics by highly qualified technical domain experts are
essential. These people are not experienced software developers.
However, with Python and the right support, we can give them powerful
tools to accomplish their task efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pioneering Python in a larger enterprise can be challenging. At present,
we use Python in selected areas of our product development and
production processes. We'd like to share our challenges and solutions
with using Python in a heterogeneous company environment. In particular,
how can we make Python accessible to non-programmers? How do we ensure
consistent development? How do we embed in the non-Python ecosystem of
the company?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we tell the story how Python became a central tool for our R&amp;amp;D activities. This includes technical aspects as well as organization and culture. How do you make sure that hundreds of people work in consistent environments? – How do you get all people on board to work together with Python? – You have lots of domain experts without much software background. How do you prevent them from creating a mess when projects get larger?&lt;/p&gt;
