Whether you have a cache, memoizing a function, tracking objects, or
various other bookkeeping needs, you definitely do not want code leaking
memory or resources. In this talk, we will look at illuminating examples
drawn from a variety of sources on how to use weak references to prevent
such bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

The
idea is if &amp;quot;&amp;quot;release early, release often&amp;quot;&amp;quot; is good, releasing very
often is better. It's not trivial. Automation is part of the battle, and
testing is another. Learn to use tools like Jenkins and Ansible to move
from deploying software once a month to 15 times every hour, and why
you'll want to.&lt;/p&gt;

humans and machines, reflection on 3 years of hacktivism &amp;amp; exploration

Deploying code manually
with rsync? There’s a better way. SaltStack is one of the latest and

lightning-fast remote execution, you can build anything on top of it.
Plus, it’s written in Python, and easy to extend!&lt;/p&gt;

encourage; and shows how to write good tests which help assure proper

Libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, gensim, and Theano help developers
build projects that were previously impossible, and these applications
empower our users and can make fundamental improvements in daily life.
This talk will show you the why, what, and how of machine learning in
Python.&lt;/p&gt;

strong compile-time correctness guarantees with fast performance... and
it plays nice with ctypes! Come learn how you can call Rust functions
from Python code and finally say goodbye to hacking C!&lt;/p&gt;

get dismissed as being too complicated to understand and implement. This
talk breaks down the neural net structure as simply as possible, so you
have a framework on which to grow your knowledge in the space. I will
put neural nets in the context of real-world applications and share
Python packages and code where you can get started building your own.
Coming out this talk you won't know everything about neural nets, but
you will walk away with a solid foundation and some resources on where
to go next to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk addresses some of the biggest technical and psychological
barriers to contributing, from the perspective of both the newcomers who
want to overcome them and the maintainers who want to remove them.&lt;/p&gt;

testing and exploration environment for firmware, ACPI, and UEFI. This
talk will explore porting Python to a new platform, embedding Python,
recreating enough of libc and POSIX to run Python without an OS, and
binding to platform-specific services. Includes live demo of bare-metal
Python, directly driving hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

python interpreter, by compiling PyPy into javascript and retargeting
its JIT to emit javascript code at runtime. This talk will demonstrate
the combination of technologies that make such a thing possible, the
results achieved so far, and the challenges that still remain when
taking python onto javascript's home turf.&lt;/p&gt;

experience in other languages. Instead of a traditional top-down
presentation of Python's features, syntax, and semantics, students are
immersed in the language bottom-up with hundreds of small examples using
the interactive interpreter to quickly gain familiarity with most of the
core language features.&lt;/p&gt;
