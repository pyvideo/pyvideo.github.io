&lt;p&gt;It consists of two parts: a UDP beacon which advertises services by name and discovers other service adverts; and a messaging API which offers simple to-and-fro communication as well as simple pub-sub (&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;) facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover the origins of the module, its use, and the obstacles which might prevent its wider adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

13-15-year- old boys to learn how to code with a small element of
physical computing thrown in. This talk will describe the reasons for
the setup and approach I used, and will discuss the outcomes: what
worked; what didn't; and what I might do differently.&lt;/p&gt;
