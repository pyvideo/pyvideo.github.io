In this talk I will talk about how we're doing this (we - at the Public Knowledge Workshop), and present the unique software frameworks and tools we've built to accomplish this goal. In particular, I will talk about the data-package pipelines framework, which combines a suite of standards and tools for 'packaging' data as well as a versatile engine for processing data streams.&lt;/p&gt;
