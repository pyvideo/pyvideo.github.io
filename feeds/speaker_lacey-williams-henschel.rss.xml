There is new vocabulary to learn, new commands to memorize, and new
files to add to each project. Most resources fall into one of two camps:
they teach you the bare bones of Docker but still leave you with too
many questions to comfortably try it on your own, or they throw you into
the deep end by assuming you’re more familiar with Docker than you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you will find that middle ground: a talk that doesn’t
assume you’re familiar with Docker and so keeps everything simple, but
leaves you with enough information that you can get started as soon as
you leave the room. Together, we will step through the parts of a
Dockerfile and learn what they do. Then, I’ll introduce you to Docker
Compose and explain why using it to run multiple containers is helpful.
Finally, you will learn to run commands and execute scripts from the
command line using Docker, how to enter a container and why you might
need to, and what to do before you go home for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audience: Djangonauts who are curious about Docker, need to learn to use
it for work or personal projects, or who seek a better understanding of
containers in general. Audience members might be beginners to
Python/Django or not, but they are definitely beginners to
containerizing all the things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience should be familiar with basic Python concepts such as
variables and running things from the command line. Some basic
familiarity with Django would be helpful, but beginner Djangonauts will
be able to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will discuss how we can take lessons from literature to write more readable code, make better tests, and create more usable websites. At the end of the day, after all, our job is to write. Surely the techniques of great writers have something to teach us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this humanities-based talk, you'll learn about Freytag's pyramid and what it has to do with writing clean code, why writing those dastardly outlines before your term papers helped prepare you for your job as an engineer, and see for yourself how The Zen of Python is basically a modern retelling of Strunk and White's classic Elements of Style. You will leave inspired to go read your favorite book to get some tips for your next project.&lt;/p&gt;

next meetup, workshop, or conference more inclusive of people with
disabilities, including how to advertise your accommodations, what to
look for in a venue, and some free tools to help your website be more
accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two English degrees, and I’ve identified some concrete ways this
makes me a better developer. This talk will discuss how we can take
lessons from literature to write more readable code, make better tests,
and create more usable websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll compare Two Scoops of Django to Strunk and White’s The Elements of
Style, that familiar freshman comp text, to explore how they are more
alike than they are different. We’ll discuss the importance of
readability, creating a “story arc” in your tests through good user
stories, how variables names have characterization, and the importance
of whitespace and good formatting to everyone. I’ll also compare PEP8 to
the MLA Handbook; there’s a reason both disciplines have a style guide!&lt;/p&gt;
