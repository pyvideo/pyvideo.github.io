However, we realized that these tools have limitations and are not very helpful to manual diagnosticians. Therefore, we planned to create a tool that can provide manual diagnosticians with useful information in advance from a manual perspective to reduce time spent. In this presentation, we will share how we conducted research to predict vulnerabilities while developing a web vulnerability manual analysis tool and what Python modules were utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
