of bootcamp students, this talk will walk through what I have learned
about accelerated adult learning and tell you the what and the why
around techniques that you can use to more efficiently pick up your next
technology in record time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the wealth of learning materials out there, why is it still not
easy to pick up and learn new technologies? Why do we still have trouble
going from learning to doing? With limited time to pick up the new
things that will advance our careers, what's the most efficient way to
retain and implement the new skills that we need? Taking lessons from
adult learning theory and from examples of hundreds of bootcamp
students, this talk will walk through what I have learned about
accelerated adult learning and tell you the what and the why around
techniques that you can use to more efficiently pick up your next
technology in record time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been substantial research done on how adults learn, but they
aren't widely known. Using the same learning tactics you used as a kid
doesn't always bring the best results or results that will stick. Adults
shouldn't be aiming to memorize facts for a test, they should be looking
to build long term skills that they can apply when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will pass on some of the most important and actionable
findings in adult learning research and will walk attendees through a
path to learning a new skill that is efficient and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dreyfus Model of Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How learning shifts between the novice and the intermediate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the levels of mastery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Effective Tech Bootcamp model of learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What learning techniques are effective and why&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a learning plan that works for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
