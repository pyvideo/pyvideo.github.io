In this session I'll build and explain a serverless service to support our support team (and I will try saying it fast).  I deep dive on running and porting applications to a serverless application environment like AWS lambda. This comes with a variety of debugging, system architecture and version compatibility concerns and limitations that I will ununfold throughout the talk.
Attendees will leave the room with the tools and techniques to adopt serverless principles and tools to build scalable serverless APIs and applications.&lt;/p&gt;
