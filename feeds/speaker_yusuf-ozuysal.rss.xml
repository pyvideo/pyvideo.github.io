is vital. However, many Large Language Model (LLM) systems keep crucial
information to train large language models at scale proprietary,
contradicting the principles of openness that define the Python
ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session invites you to explore how Snowflake's AI research team
implements openness in building and sharing generative AI developments,
prioritizing simplicity and ease-of-use while maintaining efficiency at
scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, you’ll learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How open tools, practices, datasets, and recipes contribute to and
inform our research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The recipes we used – including what worked and what didn’t – when
training LLMs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developer-first example use cases of prompting, retrieval, and
presentation using the datasets, embeddings, and model trainings we
developed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
