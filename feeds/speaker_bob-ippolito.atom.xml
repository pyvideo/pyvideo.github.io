concurrency services?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can we learn from Erlang or Haskell for building reliable high
concurrency services? Bob was involved in many Python projects but
argues that for some domains there may be better methods found
elsewhere. He started looking for alternatives back in 2006 when
building high concurrency services at Mochi Media (originally with
Twisted), which led him to the land of Erlang and later Haskell. Bob is
going to talk about what he learned along the way. In particular, heâ€™ll
cover some techniques that are used in functional programming languages
and how they can be used to solve problems in more performant, robust
and/or concise ways than the standard practices in Python. He is also
going to discuss some potential ways that the Python language and its
library ecosystem could evolve accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by Bob Ippolito&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software testing helps verify that your code meets a specification, but
not how to improve the specification. How can you stay competitive when
most of the big names today are using analysis to guide product
evolution? Level the playing field and make better products by learning
how to design experiments, collect data, make measurements, and optimize
your specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
