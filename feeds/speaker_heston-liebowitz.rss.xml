&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet connected doorbells are all the rage, but buying something off the shelf is no fun. At least so thought a Pythonista with a semester's worth of electrical engineering under his belt. In this talk, you'll follow Hestonâ€™s (mis)adventures as he connects a Rasperry Pi to his old school doorbell chime, builds a voice-powered UI with Twilio, and hooks it all together with the Google Firebase Realtime Database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were sparks. There was smoke. There was great success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come learn about Raspberry Pi's GPIO abilities. Come learn about subscribing to server-sent events from Python. Come learn about the perils of forgetting to calculate the maximum power dissipation of a resistor network (spoiler alert: it's fire).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heston Liebowitz is a full-stack developer, entrepreneur, and tinkerer at heart. He's currently an engineering manager at Lyft where he runs the Lyft.com and Amp teams (you know, that cool glowy thing on the dashboard). He was previously a frontend developer at Google, as well as several small startups you've probably never heard of. He thinks Python is the greatest language ever, but occasionally dabbles in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
