and satellite imagery such as turn lane marking detection, road and
building footprint detection. In doing so, we show the potential of
large-scale object detection and segmentation on aerial and satellite
imagery. We give insights into how imagery training sets can be built
with little or no human annotations needed making use of available
datasets such as OpenStreetMap. We then focus on modeling aspects for
object detection and segmentation. In doing so we give an insight into
state-of-the-art detection systems and adaptions we had to make for the
aerial and satellite imagery domain. We conclude the talk with lessons
learned in building these large-scale object detection and segmentation
pipelines, and show potential for future work in this domain. Slides:
