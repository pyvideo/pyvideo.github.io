In my talk, I will share how a Biologist's mindset can make R package writing more approachable. This talk is an encouragement and a gentle stroll through the package building process. I will show you ways to be curious when you get stuck and how to prepare for the unexpected. I hope sharing my perspective will help others see package development as wonderful as the natural world and dispel any hesitation to start!&lt;/p&gt;
