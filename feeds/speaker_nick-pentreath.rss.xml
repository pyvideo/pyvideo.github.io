data processing. It offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python as
well as a rich set of libraries including stream processing, machine
learning, and graph analytics. Spark is currently one of the most
exciting and fastest-growing Apache open source projects. This talk will
give an overview of the Apache Spark project and introduce the basics of
PySpark, the Python API for Spark. It will then dive a little deeper
into PySpark internals, and finally show some examples and a live demo
covering PySpark, Spark's SQL engine, and machine learning with Spark's
built-in libraries as well as other Python libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
