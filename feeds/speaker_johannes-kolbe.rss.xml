&lt;p&gt;We will follow master detective Robot Holmes on his way to solve one of his hardest cases so far - a series of mysterious murders in the city of MLington. The traces lead him to the Vision-Language part of town, which has been a quiet and tranquil place with few incidents until lately. For a few months the neighbourhood has been growing extensively and careless benchmark leaders are dropping dead at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robot Holmes sets out to find the cause for this new development and will gather intel on some of the most notorious of the new citizens of the Vision-Language neighbourhood and find out what makes them tick.&lt;/p&gt;
