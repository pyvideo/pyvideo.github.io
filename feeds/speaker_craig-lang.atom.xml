his comfort zone and found Python. The discovery is highlighted while a
dos batch script is converted into a much more powerful Python script.
Several standard modules that were useful in the script are covered.
This retrospective of one's discovery of Python is very newbie friendly
and entertaining for experienced as well.&lt;/p&gt;
