&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dr. Greg Wilson (University of Toronto)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since September 2008, teams of undergraduates from half a dozen
different universities have been building a Django-based replacement for
Trac called Basie. This talk will present what they've accomplished and
discuss what we've learned about getting junior developers who are
juggling half a dozen projects at once to build production-quality code.&lt;/p&gt;
